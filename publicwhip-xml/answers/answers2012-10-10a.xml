The Government's rationalisation programme of state bodies and the reduction in public service numbers generally has resulted in reduced requirement for office space. Addressing these changes will involve a comprehensive review of public service accommodation policies particularly in relation to space norms, open plan accommodation and efficiency drivers. A cross-disciplinary committee in OPW is currently developing a set of standards for office accommodation and space norms in accordance with international practice.</p><p>  The OPW is also defining a map-based Public Service property inventory and web portal for State property to facilitate data sharing. This web application will be used to integrate property data generated by a variety of public bodies to manage the State's property assets more effectively across the service.  </p><p>In relation to energy consumption, Deputies will be aware of the <i>&#8220;Optimising Power @ Work&#8221;</i>   initiative which began in 2008. This was introduced to raise awareness with employees on the importance of conserving energy. Over the past number of years the OPW has installed energy-logging equipment in all large State buildings. Expanding energy performance measurement and raising awareness of the importance of reducing energy consumption across the public sector will continue.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000062#WRB00500"><p>In light of the need to accelerate the reform agenda, late last year my Department published the Public Service Reform Plan. This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. </p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.</p><p>  My Department recently issued Circular 06/12 that implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to maintain the delivery of services in the context of tighter budgetary constraints.  </p><p>  The Government recently agreed to the establishment of a National Procurement Office under the aegis of my Department. This Office will integrate procurement policy, strategy, training, and operations in one office. The primary objectives of the Office will be to improve public procurement capacity across the public service and to deliver increased value for money.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation in public procurement as outlined in Circular 10/10, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small &amp; Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under Circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.  The National Procurement Service, as part of its education and development remit, also has an active programme to assist SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  The next event in this programme will be a major 'Meet the Buyer' event in Kilkenny in November at which it is anticipated more than 400 SMEs will attend.</p><p>   While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements &ndash; for example the supply of energy or gas - it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services- can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

It would be necessary for the Deputy to obtain the information he requires from the different organisations concerned.</p><p>  However, in regard to the civil service, I can inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works&rsquo; property portfolio consists of approximately 2,200 buildings, of which some 60% are State owned and the remainder leased. The contraction in numbers employed in the public service generally has resulted in reduced accommodation requirements over the past number of years. This factor, along with the policy of the Garda authorities to close selected Garda Stations throughout the country, has resulted in a significant increase in the number of vacant buildings in the portfolio. </p><p>  Currently, there are approximately 100 vacant State owned buildings in the Office of Public Works&rsquo; portfolio. Of these, 47 are former Garda Stations and the rest comprise mainly former custom posts and coastguard stations. These properties are currently being considered for alternate State use. If no such requirement arises they will be included in a disposal programme. Proposals for community use will be considered on a case by case basis. The Office of Public Works is, in fact, already engaging with the community in relation to these types of properties, as is evidenced by the recent licensing of the former Garda Station in Finglas to a community creche.   </p><p>  In the time available, it has not been possible to collate data on the cost of maintenance, security etc. for the individual vacant buildings in the Office of Public Works&rsquo; portfolio. However, if the Deputy had particular queries in relation to any specific building, the Office would seek to facilitate him in that regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000062#WRB01000"><p>Under the Public Service Reform Plan my Department is reviewing the grading structure of the Civil Service. The Review will examine the number and distribution of management grades across the Civil Service, the percentage of the pay bill accounted for by such grades and taking account of organisational needs and best practice, assess the scope to reduce the number of management grades. In line with the commitment in the Public Service Reform Plan, this review will be completed by end June 2013. Preliminary work has been commenced on the Review with a view to completing the assessment in conformity with the Reform Plan timetable. Review of the grading structures in other sectors of the Public Service is a matter for the relevant parent Department in each case.</p><p>  Pay rates at senior levels in the public service have already been reduced by up to 15% and an additional progressive pension related reduction applied through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009. Pay rates for senior civil and public service employees, as for salary rates for all public servants will continue to be addressed as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall public service pay policy. In line with this policy, the Government adopted my proposal in June 2011 for the introduction of:- </p><p>- a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service; and</p><p>- a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies.</p><p>  Following the outcome to the referendum on remuneration for the Judiciary the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 was enacted. This Act provided for the application of the pay reduction and the pension levy to serving members of the judiciary and provided for reduced remuneration rates for newly appointed members of the judiciary with effect from 1 January 2012. The Act also made provision to bring certain Office holders (Comptroller and Auditor General and Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la) within the public service pay ceiling and for the reduction of remuneration for future appointees as President and the Office of Ombudsman. This legislation also formally provides for the reduction in the salary rates for members of the Government. Ongoing arrangements are being made on an administrative basis to implement the pay ceiling for future appointments where that is appropriate, for example within the Civil Service and the Heads of four Universities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000062#WRB01200"><p>My Department is engaged in the ongoing review and reform of the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) in the Civil Service. </p><p>  A major external review of PMDS was carried out in 2005 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting (Mercer). Using best practice in the review and design of performance management systems, the <i>Review of PMDS</i>   was a comprehensive evaluation that provided baseline information on how PMDS was working in 2005.  The evaluation comprised feedback from a system-wide PMDS survey and a series of focus groups, interviews and workshops.  </p><p>  Since the Mercer evaluation, my Department reviews PMDS on an ongoing and comprehensive basis using both the survey instrument designed by Mercer and other methods of evaluation. </p><p>  My Department ran a survey again in 2010, using the instrument designed by Mercer, across all staff in the Civil Service and the results of this survey - <i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010</i>  - are available on the Department&#8217;s website. </p><p>  Other monitoring carried out by my Department on an ongoing basis includes: </p><p>  - a review of the annual compliance with PMDS and the distribution of performance ratings across the Civil Service &#8211; also available on my Department&#8217;s website; </p><p>  - feedback from the Secretaries General and HR managers on their perceptions of PMDS;</p><p>  - focus groups and workshops on aspects of performance management including the management of underperformance. </p><p>  The analysis of the results from <i>The Evaluation of PMDS</i><i>Survey 2010</i>   and other reviews carried out by my Department identified that there are serious deficiencies in the approach taken to performance management in the Civil Service.  In general, PMDS is not seen as an effective tool in the management of performance. It is seen as overly bureaucratic, with an emphasis on form-filling, lacking in fairness and consistency, with too many staff getting high ratings. The feedback also highlights that there is a widespread belief across the system that underperformance is not being managed. </p><p>  The operation of the PMDS system has very recently been subject to independent scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the 2010 Report contained a Chapter on Performance Management and Development in the Civil Service.  The C&amp;AG&#8217;s audit highlighted issues such as the consistency and quality of the PMDS assessment process; the extent of timely compliance with PMDS; whether increments are effectively linked to appraisal results and how well the system is contributing to competency development and performance improvement. </p><p>  The conclusions of the C&amp;AG were in line with the findings of my Department&#8217;s analysis of the failings of performance management in the Civil Service.  I have on previous occasions stated that PMDS is not working well but that we are addressing the issues in a structured and coherent way.  My Department has used the findings from <i>The Evaluation of PMDS Survey 2010</i>   and the C&amp;AG&#8217;s Report to improve the design and operation of PMDS.  Significant changes to PMDS have now been agreed between management in the Civil Service and the unions under the Croke Park Agreement. </p><p>  In 2011, an initial phase of changes was introduced aimed at improving the operation of PMDS. This involved streamlining the paperwork associated with PMDS primarily to create space for more discussion about performance between staff and managers. Critically we have also increased manager accountability for managing performance by giving a low rating to managers who do not manage the performance of their staff proactively. </p><p>  In July of this year, my Department, alongside management of the Civil Service and unions, agreed further changes to address the more fundamental issues that were identified in both <i>The Evaluation of PMDS</i><i>Survey 2010</i>   and the C&amp;AG Report in 2010 and, in particular, a perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of the system.   These changes are:</p><p>- a new grade-based Competency Framework;</p><p>- a revised rating scale with improved descriptions of performance levels;</p><p>- reviews of performance will be decided by a process of calibration. This process is commonly used in many public and private sector organizations to assist managers in delivering a realistic and consistent approach to the assessment of performance;</p><p>- a more comprehensive process of internal review of ratings, with access to external review; </p><p>- a rating of &#8216;Fully Achieved Expectations&#8217; will be required for the award of an increment.</p><p>  A key challenge is for senior leadership across the Civil Service to demonstrate their own commitment to delivering a high performance culture and to fully engage line managers in the management and improvement of performance. My Department will continue to review how we mange performance in the Civil Service and on the basis of this we will continue to make changes aimed at improving PMDS as it is the primary tool for managing performance in the Civil Service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000062#WRB01400"><p>The Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as set out in the Programme for Government. We are bringing public expenditure back to sustainable levels and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p><p>  As part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE), conducted in 2011, each Department, including my own, undertook an in-depth analysis of their spending programmes.  The purpose of the CRE was to identify: expenditure programme savings; scope for savings arising from efficiency and other reforms; redundant and obsolete processes; proposals for reducing and/or merging of agencies; and associated reductions in staff numbers.  The detailed reports of each Department as well as the final Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 have been published, in line with Programme for Government commitments, on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  This fundamental re-assessment of spending priorities forms a key platform for the Government&rsquo;s overall Public Service Reform agenda.</p><p>  The Government has set a target of reducing public service staff numbers to 282,500 by end-2014. As of mid 2012, Public Service numbers stood at 292,000, which is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008 and is comparable to the 2005 staffing levels. Service levels have been largely maintained notwithstanding these considerable staff reductions due to increased productivity/workplace flexibilities. The estimated reduction in the pay bill cost from 2009 to 2015 is &euro;3.8 billion.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to far reaching reform of the Public Service and providing better value for money in service delivery. The Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, which was published last November, outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform.</p><p>  Implementation of this Reform Plan is being co-ordinated and monitored by the Reform and Delivery Office in my Department. Good progress has been made and last month I published a Progress Report setting out the achievements made to date against the major elements of the Public Service Reform Plan. I will be meeting the Public Accounts Committee tomorrow to discuss progress and will also be meeting the Committee of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks in this regard.</p><p>  Major initiatives in the Reform Plan that are contributing to the achievement of efficiencies in both staffing and service provision include the increased use of shared services in all sectors which will mean that fewer staff and financial resources are required to perform those business functions as duplication is eliminated. Progress is being made on the consolidation of ICT across the Public Service, including a programme of data centre consolidation as set out in the Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Service published in July. </p><p>  In addition, we are in the process of examining activities which may be suitable for external service delivery, which has the potential to deliver more efficient and flexible services and to lower costs. The reform of the central procurement function, through the establishment of a National Procurement Office to be led by a Chief Procurement Officer, the recruitment process for which is underway, has the potential to yield savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million over a three year period depending on the approach taken.</p><p>  Central to the delivery of the objectives of the Reform Plan is a strong focus on implementation and delivery. Government Departments and major Offices have produced Integrated Reform Delivery Plans, which place centrally driven initiatives in the context of organisational and sectoral reforms. Each sector is responsible for the delivery of their Sectoral Plans and progress made on these plans is being overseen by the Reform and Delivery Office, which is also driving an increased capacity and capability for change, both centrally and across the various sectors of the Public Service, to ensure that the focus is firmly on implementation and delivery.</p></reply>

An appropriate vacancy, for these purposes, is a fillable vacancy, in the officer's grade and Department, in the location in which he/she was serving immediately prior to commencing the career break. In the context of this Circular, &quot;location&quot; means geographic area, with the Dublin area being treated as one such location (save any change to such arrangements made in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with the staff side).</i></p><p>  Paragraph 22:   <i>Where an appropriate vacancy does not exist, the parent Department should contact the officer at once to notify him/her of the position, indicating, where possible, when it is likely that a suitable vacancy may arise. Where it is likely that the officer may be reassigned to another Department, his/her parent Department should alert him/her to that possibility. Officers, who are waiting to resume duty at the end of their career break, should be advised to contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ascertain whether or not they have any entitlements to jobseekers or any other benefits.</i></p><p>  The Circular also advised civil servants to check out their own individual situations with the then Department of Social and Family Affairs prior to commencing a career break (paragraph 31 of Circular refers) and to check periodically as to the up-to-date position.</p><p>  To ensure that staff were absolutely clear on the terms and conditions of this Scheme, anyone who took a career break under the Scheme was required to sign a Form of Undertaking, acknowledging that they understood the conditions of the career break as set out in Circular 13/2009 and that particular attention had been drawn to the paragraphs dealing with return to duty following the expiry of the career break.</p><p>  As participants in the Scheme were not at work, I can confirm that no PRSI contribution was paid by them during the three year period of the Incentivised Career Break Scheme and it follows that no reckonable contribution was added to their record for that period. From the perspective of the Department of Social Protection, I understand that this does not preclude a person applying for Jobseekers Allowance.</p><p>  In addition, there is no preclusion on civil servants seeking employment elsewhere while awaiting resumption of duty, subject to the avoidance of any conflict of interest between such employment and the person's continuing status as a civil servant.</p></reply>

In particular I introduced a <i>Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), </i>with fixed multi-annual current expenditure ceilings clearly set out for each Ministerial Vote Group.  The expenditure ceilings introduce greater certainty into medium-term expenditure planning.  To underpin the <i>Medium Term Expenditure Framework </i>the Government published the <i>Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2012</i>   on 28th September 2012.</p><p>  This Bill puts the Ministerial expenditure ceilings on a statutory footing.  I look forward to discussing and debating this measure before the House in coming weeks.</p><p>  The <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report </i>also provided for a new &#8220;whole-of-year&#8221; budgetary process, whereby the 2013 Ministerial expenditure allocations would be open for scrutiny and discussion before the relevant Oireachtas Committees, well in advance of the detailed Estimates allocations being settled this autumn.  Indeed I wrote to the Chairperson of all relevant committees in January of this year, inviting them to avail of this opportunity for <i>ex-ante</i>   engagement.  I understand that the practical issues involved are currently being considered by the various committees.</p><p>  As regards the 2013 Estimates themselves, these are still under consideration by the Government.  Once finalised by the Government in due course, the Estimates will be presented to the Dail in the normal way.  While discussions take place around broad policy options with the EU/IMF programme partners, the question of maintaining confidentiality in regard to the detailed Estimates decisions does not arise in this context.</p></reply>

Of this amount, Government Departments identified savings of some &euro;1.5 million, the majority of which is related to the abolition of qualification allowances in Education.</p><p>  Further to this, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform identified allowances which it considers not to have a valid business case, and which will not now be paid to new beneficiaries.  The immediate abolition of these allowances is expected to generate savings of &euro;2m in 2012.  The largest classes of allowance responsible for these savings are rent allowances.  There are also savings expected in Education and Defence through the abolition of allowances relating to living in Gaeltacht regions, on islands, and for teaching through Irish.</p><p>  Significant medium term savings are achievable by precluding the payment of unjustified allowances to new beneficiaries, with the cost of allowances reducing as those in receipt of them leave, or by each public service sector reviewing the allowances paid to ensure that sufficient value is achieved from them.  </p><p>  In the interests of bringing these savings to the paybill forward, my Department has written to sectoral management instructing them to immediately engage with staff interests with a view to securing their early agreement to the elimination of those Departmental allowances payable to current beneficiaries, where no business cases exists to pay those allowances to new beneficiaries.  In addition, Departments have been asked to identify other allowances, including legacy allowances, for elimination from current beneficiaries.</p><p>  It is intended that, rather than conduct a further central review, these sectoral discussions will result in further improvements in procedures, extract greater value from those allowances that continue to be paid, and the elimination of a number of allowances for which no business case exists, leading to further savings for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The price paid to enter PIPS is intended to cover all future payments to these pensioners and also the administration costs of the scheme. Pricing was carried out by the National Treasury Management Agency on a basis that is cost-neutral to the Exchequer. No additional State resources are therefore needed to support the PIPS scheme.</p><p>  Under PIPS the Exchequer has been able to provide pensions at a lower cost than would a commercial enterprise.

This compares with 11.5% at end-September 2011.  A variance of between 10% and 12% is not unusual. Departments have indicated that they do not expect any significant savings by year end and so I expect a return to profile at that stage.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.</p><p>  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed. The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year.</p></reply>

At mid 2012 Public Service numbers were around 292,000.  This is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008 and is comparable to the 2005 staffing levels.  Service levels have been largely maintained, and in fact increased in some areas, notwithstanding these considerable staff reductions due to increased productivity/workplace flexibilities.</p><p>  The Government agreed last July in order to maximise paybill savings to accelerate the programme of staff reductions.  It was also noted at that time that where staff surpluses are identified a targeted voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme would be implemented.  The Government decision of the 2nd of October confirmed that a Voluntary Redundancy Scheme would be made available for targeted areas throughout the Public Service.</p><p>  Identification of staff surpluses is under way.  My Ministerial colleagues are actively examining particular works areas, bodies, locations or grades at which voluntary redundancy can be targeted.  Of course there will be full regard for the skills needs and priorities of Departments now and into the future during this process.  I would stress that there will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be subject to ongoing business needs.  Final decisions on numbers reductions to be achieved in each sector will take account of the surpluses identified by Ministers in respect of their portfolios and of expected rates of retirements in those sectors over the next few years.  The reports that the Government intends to seek 10,000 redundancies are incorrect and are not helpful.</p></reply>

Under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, Ministerial pensions are not payable to new Oireachtas Members (as defined in the Act) before 65 years of age and, under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009, Ministerial pensions are no longer payable to sitting Members of the Oireachtas following the last general election, or to Members of the European Parliament following the next elections to the Parliament.</p><p>  Public Service pensions for former Ministers who retire after February 2012 will be reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts, and for those who retired before the end of February the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies.  I provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions in excess of &euro;100,000 to 20% of the excess amount, effective from 1 January of this year.</p><p>  Furthermore, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme with a new minimum pension age of 66, rising in due course with the age at which the State Pension (Contributory) will become payable.  This will apply to all new Members of the Oireachtas, including new entrant Ministers, as defined in the Act.  This Act also provides that pensions for all Public Servants who are subject to the Act will be based on career average earnings, as opposed to the current final salary basis.</p><p>  It is important to point out that legal advice from the Attorney General says that it is possible to apply proportionate reductions to existing pensions, as has been done to date in the FEMPI legislation.  However, account must be taken of the fact that pension benefits are considered to be property rights, which limits the action that can be taken.</p></reply>

It was agreed at that meeting, in the light of stakeholder requests, to carry out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations.  The carrying out of this exercise is contingent on  favourable hydrological conditions and for this reason it has not been possible to date to undertake the exercise.  It is intended to carry out the exercise as soon as conditions permit.</p><p>  I also met with the representatives of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI), and the Irish Boat Rental Association (IBRA) on 27 September, 2012 to discuss their concerns regarding operational controls on the Shannon.  These concerns have been passed to Jacobs Engineering for active consideration in the context of its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp; Management (CFRAM) Study for the River Shannon, as part of the national CFRAM programme.  </p><p>  Further, a briefing of the Irish Farmers Association by Jacobs Engineering on the latter's Report on a  Review of Operational Control of Water Levels on the River Shannon has been arranged for 24th October 2012.   </p><p>  I can assure you that I will  maintain the close interest and involvement in this matter that I have demonstrated to date.    </p><p>  It is my intention to ensure that constructive dialogue continues with all the main stakeholders and that progress can be made towards achieving a balanced and fair solution where the water in the Shannon and its lakes is maintained at levels which meets the needs of business, navigation, power generation and the welfare of those living and farming directly adjacent to the main river channel.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware there are a number of specific categories of public bodies which are longstanding exclusion from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction on account of the specific characteristics of the bodies within these categories and the assessment following consultation with the Ombudsman that they do not warrant inclusion under the Act.  The general principle that has guided this assessment is whether the individual citizen's interest is served from inclusion of the public body or otherwise.  In particular, it has been a priority to ensure that as much as possible public bodies who in their day-to-day activities and administration have significant engagement and interaction with large numbers of citizens and have the potential through their administration and decision-making to give rise to an adverse effect for individual citizens.  Consequently in general public bodies within the following categories of public body will remain exempt from review:- </p><p>- commercial State bodies, </p><p>- economic sectoral regulators</p><p>- bodies involved in the criminal justice and legal system</p><p>- research and advisory bodies with little or no interface with the general public.  </p><p>  In addition, while it has not proved possible in the time available to carry out a detailed comparison of the public bodies currently exempted from review by the Ombudsman and those largely drawn from the above categories which it is now proposed to exempt.  </p><p>  This reflects the process carried out by my Department with other Departments and in consultation with the Office of the Ombudsman to seek to ensure that all public bodies are listed either as reviewable or exempt agencies under the Bill, given that previously a significant number of public bodies were neither.  As I indicated in the course of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill in the Seanad the process will secure the extension of the Ombudsman's power to review administrative decision-making to 140 public bodies which are currently excluded.  Following the enactment of the Bill the Ombudsman will have the legal authority to carry out administrative review on well over 300 public bodies.</p></reply>

Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.  These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include: </p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &#8364;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>- less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering procedures and greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering;</p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p><p>  Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years.  It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular.  In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small &amp; Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.99.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000065#WRE01600"><p>Several measures have been taken in recent years which serve to reduce pension awards and pensions in payment to retired public servants, including retired senior civil servants. </p><p>  The pensions of former civil and public servants who retire or have retired from February 2012 onward are reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts. </p><p>  For public servants who retired up to the end of February 2012, the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies.  I provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions in excess of &euro;100,000 to 20% of the excess amount, effective from 1 January of this year. </p><p>  In June 2011 the Government agreed with my proposal to apply a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher posts across the public service. Revised salary rates in line with that ceiling are now in place for future Secretaries General, who, in addition, can no longer get notional added years or immediate pensions before preserved pension age.  These retrenchments in respect of salary and exit terms will ultimately reduce Exchequer pension costs in respect of senior civil servants. </p><p>  Looking further ahead, the recently enacted Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 provides for a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  This scheme will apply to all new-joiner public servants and will ultimately deliver significant Exchequer savings through reduced public service pensions.  These long-term savings will derive from key features of the Single Scheme, principally an increase in pension age, inflation linkage of benefits and career-average accrual.  The career-average component of the Single Scheme, in particular, is expected to have a marked impact in moderating the pensions paid to persons retiring from senior civil service posts. </p><p>  It is important to point out that legal advice from the Attorney General says that it is possible to apply proportionate reductions to existing pensions, as has been done to date in the FEMPI legislation.  However, account must be taken of the fact that pension benefits are generally regarded as vested property rights, which must be considered in the public interest when taking action.</p></reply>

My Department takes the lead on key cross-cutting initiatives and each sector is responsible for the delivery of their sectoral plans.</p><p>  Strong governance arrangements and processes to oversee implementation have been put in place. The Reform Programme is being driven by the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform, and a number of other key groups are in place to support that. Implementation is being coordinated and monitored by the Reform and Delivery Office in my Department. Individual Departments and major Offices have also established Change Delivery Teams, which are working closely with the Reform and Delivery Office on their own reform plans.</p><p>  The recent Progress Report on the implementation of the Reform Plan, published last month, highlights the progress that has been made over the last nine months, including in areas such as shared services, eGovernment, procurement reform, external service delivery and the programme of political reform.</p><p>  eGovernment 2012-2015, approved by Government and published in early April, sets out a new approach to eGovernment for the Irish Public Service and is based on the recognition in the Programme for Government and the Public Service Reform Plan that Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are key enablers to delivering improved public services.</p><p>  This strategy was developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in conjunction with the Public Service Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council. The CIO Council is a representative forum for senior managers with responsibility for ICT and/or eGovernment from across the Civil and Public Service to discuss key issues in these areas, and to provide expert input to decisions and actions to maximise the positive impact of ICT and eGovernment on public service modernisation and customer service.</p><p>  Following on from the eGovernment Strategy, the Government published, in July, its Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Service. Cloud computing is a radically new approach to the delivery of ICT services. Accordingly, it is a significant reform of how we design, develop, procure and operate our ICT environment and services.</p><p>  Good progress is being made in meeting the aggressive timelines for progressing Shared Services set out in the Public Service Reform Plan.  Together with my colleagues in Government, I am committed to the delivery of this significant transformation initiative in a planned way and on the basis of international best practice.  To this end, a dedicated Shared Service Transformation Unit has been established within my Department. In addition to leading Shared Services efforts across the Civil Service, the Unit is also working with nominated senior officials to ensure that ambitious and robust plans are developed and implemented across all Public Service sectors.</p><p>  The business case for a Civil Service HR Shared Service was approved by Government earlier this year.  A new Shared Services Centre, known as PeoplePoint, will be established in Clonskeagh in Dublin. I expect the first transitions to this new centre to commence in March of next year with all in scope bodies being transitioned by the end of 2014. It is estimated that the establishment of this centre will reduce the annual cost of HR services for the Civil Service by 26%, while the number of staff involved in currently delivering these services will reduce by a minimum of 17%. </p><p>  The Civil Service Pensions Administration Shared Services has been advanced well beyond our original target of 2014. I would now hope to have this service transition in 2013 in tandem with our new HR Shared Services Centre. </p><p>  The baselining of Civil Service payroll arrangements has been completed. A dedicated Project Team within my Department is now overseeing the production of a business case for a Civil Service Payroll Shared Service which I expect to bring to Government early next year.  In addition, officials within my Department are finalising their assessment of tenders for external assistance in carrying out a baselining and possible feasibility study relating to Financial Management and Banking Shared Services.</p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.  In determining policy, the Government has to take account of a wide range of often competing considerations and policy priorities while living up to its commitments by delivering on all the conditions and targets in the EU/IMF Programme by the required deadlines.   </p><p>  Expenditure in 2012 is being kept under close scrutiny and control, including in the context of monitoring and reporting arrangements under the EU/IMF agreement.<i></i>  Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size and costs of the public service.  All Government Departments and agencies simply have to deliver better value to the public in order to reduce the deficit and protect frontline services.</p><p>  This Government's commitment to reforming our entire public service while protecting front-line services can be exemplified in the publication of the Public Service Reform Plan which highlights a range of specific and time bound commitments which involve a freeing up of administrative resources, and a reprioritisation of resources generally, to ensure that services can continue to be delivered to the public in as cost effective a way as possible. </p></reply>

The violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale; and it is not confined to one side. I also said that what is needed above all to stop the violence is a strong UN Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, in order to halt the flow of arms to all sides in Syria and to compel those responsible for the violence which is violating the human rights of the Syrian people to stop their reprehensible actions.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect. </p><p>  There also needs to be accountability for the serious human rights abuses which are being perpetrated in Syria.  To prevent further atrocities and to save lives, we need to demonstrate clearly that these abuses will not go unpunished.  Ireland fully supports, therefore, the calls which have been made for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court. </p><p>  UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has warned about the risks of further militarization of the conflict in Syria, particularly in light of last week&rsquo;s appalling attack on the Turkish border town of Akcakale.  I do not believe that external intervention in any form at the moment will assist those suffering under Assad&rsquo;s oppressive rule or necessarily bring closer that ceasefire and end to the conflict which is so urgently needed.</p><p>  Similarly, I continue to have strong doubts and concerns about proposals to establish humanitarian corridors or safe zones within Syria, given the continuing divisions within the Security Council on Syria and the absence of any Security Council resolution authorising action on behalf of the international community.  Such proposals would require the deployment of large-scale resources, including enforcement mechanisms for which there is no consensus at the moment. There is also the risk that ongoing humanitarian operations would be severely compromised by attempts to establish safe zones or humanitarian corridors.</p><p>  The priority for now must be to lend strong support to the mediation efforts of the UN/Arab league Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his mission to negotiate a ceasefire and to launch a political process facilitating the transition which is urgently needed in Syria. The international community must also concentrate on mobilising increased resources to deal with the worsening humanitarian situation within Syria and the region; some 1.5 million Syrians are internally displaced and an estimated 300,000 refugees have fled the violence to neighbouring countries. Ireland has already committed some &euro;2.45 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis. </p><p>  Increased international pressure also needs to be applied to the Assad regime to end the violence and repression which it is inflicting on the Syrian people.  The EU has been to the forefront in imposing targeted sanctions on the Assad regime and those who provide it with support. I anticipate that a further round of targeted EU sanctions may be agreed at the Foreign Affairs Council which I will attend next week in Luxembourg. </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. </p><p>  A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:</p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month;  </p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;</p><p>- Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website www.keepingyourhome.ie,<i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i>(ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.</p><p>  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the protections afforded by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet to ensure this receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

The Act also provides for the taxation of betting exchanges at a rate of 15 per cent on the commission charged by exchanges to customers. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. Bringing remote operators within the betting tax net represents significant progress in creating a more level playing field in the sector.  In relation to the question concerning named betting exchanges, the Deputy should be aware that the Revenue Commissioners do not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that currently the commission charged to customers by betting exchanges established in the State is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.</p><p>  The Finance Act 2011 provides for an exemption from VAT for activities subject to betting intermediary duty.  Currently, bets that are subject to excise duty imposed by section 67 of the Finance Act 2002 are exempt from VAT.  These provisions are compatible with Article 135(1)(i) of the VAT Directive (2006/112/EC).</p><p>  The coming into operation of betting intermediary duty and the exemption from VAT are subject to Ministerial Commencement orders.  The making of those orders will follow the enactment of the proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill.</p></reply>

It replaced the Income Levy and Health Levy.  It is a charge payable on gross income, including notional pay, after any relief for certain trading losses and capital allowances but before pensions contributions.</p><p>  An individual whose total income does not exceed &#8364;10,036 in 2012 (&#8364;4,004 in 2011) is exempt from USC.  Furthermore, Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments are also exempt along with income already subjected to Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT).</p><p>  Where an individual's total income exceeds the annual threshold of &#8364;10,036 per annum, all income is subject to USC.  In this way the rates of USC are progressive.</p><p>  It should be noted that a lower rate of USC applies to individuals aged 70 years or over and also to <i>full</i> medical cards holders.  This is a transitional measure which will be in place until end 2014, after which the standard rates of USC will apply to those aged 70 years or over and also to full medical card holders.

The categorisation of each ETB, including the Board encompassing Counties Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, is based on a proposal set out by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC). It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the criteria used by the LRC in formulating its proposal, or on how such criteria may have been applied in the case of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB.  However, I am also aware of a perception that suggests these categorisations are an attempt to 'downgrade' some ETBs.</p><p>  I can confirm unequivocally that this categorisation relates only to determining the salary scale applicable to the Chief Executive Officer of each of the new ETBs. The categorisation laid out in the Circular has no role whatsoever in determining staffing numbers or structures in individual ETBs.  I have given some consideration to the correspondence and data sent to me by the CEO of Co Mayo VEC and I will shortly be responding to the CEO on the matter.</p></reply>

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.</p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance:</p><p>  - Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings,</p><p>  - Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal) </p><p>  - Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff,</p><p>  - Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools, and,</p><p>  - Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis.  </p><p>  The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools.  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.</p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers.</p></reply>

A breakdown by primary and post primary spend is not readily available. This allocation covers all aspects of the programme for primary and post primary schools including teacher professional development in ICT, deployment of curriculum-relevant digital content, software and ICT infrastructure deployment in schools and internet access for schools. These components are essential for an integrated approach to ICT in teaching and learning. Continuous professional development in the pedagogical/curricular use of ICT by teachers is  essential to ensure that ICT is embedded in teaching and the PDST &ndash; which now incorporates the functions of the National Centre for Technology in Education provides a comprehensive training programme for teachers. The percentage breakdown of training places in 2010 and 2011 shows that approximately 73% of the training places were taken up by primary teachers. </p><p>  The ICT in Schools Programme, through the PDST delivers a wide range of digital content through the Scoilnet.ie portal. The number of resources available has increased year on year. The PDST pursues collaborative strategies to develop appropriate digital content to match the Irish curriculum.</p><p>  I am keen to assess the impact of the funding in primary schools, and in that context it is planned to carry out a comprehensive census of ICT integration in schools before the end of the year.  In order to maximise the technology and digital content available to schools broadband access is key  and under the Schools Broadband Access Programme my Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all primary schools that wish to avail of this service. All contracts under the Schools Broadband Access Programme were recently re-tendered. As a result of this the number of service providers has been expanded from 6 to 13 and this should lead to improvements in the quality of services available to schools. These contracts were signed in July and August 2012 and the migration of schools onto the new services is currently underway.</p><p>  Following completion of the census referred to above work will commence on a new ICT Strategy which will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student devices.</p></reply>

The reforms have achieved efficiencies through a reduction in the inspection resources required for whole-school evaluations and other inspections in primary and post-primary schools. The reforms also involved improving the reports arising from inspections and introducing questionnaires for parents and students, thus giving them a greater voice in commenting on school quality. A much greater proportion of inspectors' time in evaluations is now spent on the observation of practice in classrooms and in the provision of feedback to teachers. </p><p>  Overall, across the main categories of inspection activity, the Inspectorate's outputs for 2011 were ahead of the previous year by around 15%.

The NCSE has published its agreed Action Plan under the Croke Park Agreement.  A key challenge for the NCSE has been to ensure the maintenance of its national service for all schools and students with special educational needs, within a reduced staff and budget provision.  In this regard, changes in work practices are under ongoing development within NCSE in discussion with staff through normal industrial relations channels and managerial processes.  </p><p>  Under the Croke Park Agreement and the Employment Control Framework, authorised NCSE staffing numbers have been reduced from 107 in 2011 to 103 by end 2012.

This document contains details of my plans to reform the junior cycle in post-primary schools.  A Framework for Junior Cycle builds upon proposals developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and published in November 2011 under the title, Towards a Framework for Junior Cycle - Innovation and Identity.  My Framework adopts many of the curricular changes proposed by the NCCA but it also contains more radical changes in relation to how students' progress and learning are assessed at junior cycle.</p><p>  A clear timetable for implementation which will be carried out on a phased basis up to 2020, is set out in the document. Implementation will begin in schools for those students entering first year in 2014, with English and some short courses. An extensive programme of continuing professional development will be made available to teachers to support implementation. This will begin in 2013.  I have arranged that a copy of my Framework document will be given to all members of the Oireachtas so that you are fully aware of its details and timetable.</p></reply>

At mid 2012 Public Service numbers were 292,000.  This is 28,000 below the peak numbers level of 320,000 in 2008 and is comparable to the 2005 staffing levels.  Service levels have been largely maintained, and in fact increased in some areas, notwithstanding these considerable staff reductions due to increased productivity/workplace flexibilities.  The Government have agreed to accelerate the programme of staff reductions in order to maximise paybill savings. Where staff surpluses are identified a targeted voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme would be made available for selected areas throughout the Public Service.</p><p>  Identification of staff surpluses is underway. My Ministerial colleagues are actively examining particular work areas, bodies, locations or grades at which voluntary redundancy can be targeted because of changes to work configuration or service delivery models, for example. Of course there will be full regard for the skills needs and priorities of Departments now and into the future during this process. I would stress that there will be no automatic right to redundancy and all applications will be subject to ongoing business needs. This will ensure that critical frontline services will be maintained. Details of the scheme are being finalised and will be announced in due course.</p><p>  Final decisions on numbers reductions to be achieved in each sector will take account of the surpluses identified by Ministers in respect of their portfolios and of expected rates of retirements in those sectors over the next few years.  A full cost benefit analysis will of course be required as part of this assessment. When this assessment has been completed further details of this scheme will be made available by my Department.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the &#8364;810m relates to savings that have been achieved during the lifetime of the Public Service Agreement.

While not all the matters raised in the Committee Report come within the remit of the Office of Public Works, the general scope of the Report has relevance to OPW&rsquo;s present engagement with matters on the Shannon catchment.  In response to the Committee Report, I brought the recent report carried out by Jacobs Engineering on the River Shannon Level Operation Review to the attention of the Committee and offered to facilitate a briefing on this report to Committee members.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study for the River Shannon is being carried out by Jacobs Engineering. The study also involves a very widespread public and stakeholder consultation  process to better inform the assessment of flood risks. In that context I have forwarded the Committee&rsquo;s Report to Jacobs Engineering for incorporation into its analysis and development of option recommendations under the Flood Risk Management Plan which is due for completion by end 2015.   </p><p>  In advance of the completion of that Plan, the OPW will, in conjunction with the ESB and Waterways Ireland, continue to monitor the position on the management of water levels along the Shannon. I can assure you that I will  maintain the close interest and involvement in this matter that I have demonstrated to date. I recently met again with Waterways Ireland and the ESB to review operational control protocols for water flows and levels on the Shannon. It was agreed at that meeting, in the light of stakeholder requests, to carry out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations. The carrying out of this exercise is contingent on favourable hydrological conditions and for this reason it has not been possible to date to undertake the exercise</p><p>  I also met recently with the representatives of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland (IWAI), and the Irish Boat Rental Association (IBRA) to discuss their concerns regarding operational controls on the Shannon. These concerns have been passed to Jacobs Engineering for active consideration in the context of its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp; Management (CFRAM) Study for the River Shannon, as part of the national CFRAM programme.   It is my intention to ensure that constructive dialogue continues with all the main stakeholders and that progress can be made towards achieving a balanced and fair solution where the water in the Shannon and its lakes is maintained at levels which meets the needs of business, navigation, power generation and the welfare of those farming and living directly adjacent to the main river channel.</p></reply>

Job creation is not a factor in the profiling exercise. Queries in relation to the profiling of capital allocations are a matter for individual Ministers and their Departments.  In responding to the Deputy's question however, I feel it is important to point out that a variance of around 12% in capital expenditure is not unusual. Despite such variances, over the last five years capital expenditure at end December has generally been back on profile with a variance of less than 2%.</p><p>  While my Department is not responsible for the profiling of capital expenditure it does set the overall expenditure allocations of Departments which includes setting the five year multi-annual capital envelopes. The present five year envelope was outlined in the &quot;Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework&quot; which was published last November following a Government-wide review of the public capital programme. </p><p>  There will, of course, be direct employment benefits in the delivery of the infrastructure proposed in the Investment Framework; however, it is important to note that the most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment. In this context, the review made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years and in 2012 delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery.</p></reply>

Those Departments that are proactive in driving reform, innovation and structural planning will naturally be best-placed to avail of this facility into the future.  The consequence on Departments who exceed their current expenditure ceiling in any given year will be the assimilation of an offsetting adjustment in their envelope for the following year, and they will be required to devise appropriate policy measures to live within the reduced allocation.</p><p>  The end-September, 2012 issues figures indicate that there are some pressures, most notably in the Social Protection and Health group of Votes.  The pressures relate to the cyclical nature of the largely demand led expenditure of these Departments as well as the reclassification of PRSI receipts by Revenue at the beginning of the year. </p><p>  While good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing change, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential front-line services and respond to increasing demands.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.314.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000076#WRQ00300"><p>I fully agree that Department&#8217;s and Office&#8217;s should do all in their power to contain and reduce all administrative costs including both insurance and procurement costs.  This is in keeping with Government&#8217;s overall reform and efficiency agenda.  In light of the need to accelerate the reform agenda, my Department published the Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011. This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner.  </p><p>  The reform plan includes specific measures to ensure that:</p><p>1. aggregated procurement arrangements are utilised across the public service;</p><p>2. public bodies have appropriately trained staff to implement reform and to ensure the State is getting value for money; and</p><p>3. greater emphasis will be placed on analysing what the State purchases in order to assess other savings that can be made through more efficient procurement methods.</p><p>  Since its establishment in 2009, the National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&#8217;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.</p><p>  The NPS has reported estimated procurement savings to the end of 2012 under its frameworks of &#8364;127m, comprising of &#8364;14m in 2010 and a further &#8364;35m in 2011 and projected savings of &#8364;78m for 2012.    In addition the NPS e-Tenders website generates estimated administrative savings of on average &#8364;10m per annum.  A breakdown of these procurement savings is not readily available by sector. The NPS has established a Working Group to develop the saving methodologies and reporting of procurement savings in the future.</p><p>  Circular 06/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising; and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.  </p><p>  The purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  It is estimated that &#8364;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the public procurement of supplies and services. This is a very significant portion of overall spending and it is essential that the Public Service is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. It is for this reason that public procurement is one of the major pillars of key strategic importance under the Government&#8217;s Public Service Reform Plan.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the necessary elements are in place to implement these ambitious reforms, my Department engaged Accenture to undertake a capacity and capability review of the central procurement function to identify the actions required to realise substantial savings in public procurement in the short and medium term.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Of the estimated &#8364;9 billion annual spend on public procurement of supplies and services, there is a procurement addressable spend of approximately &#8364;7 billion. The review estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &#8364;249 million to &#8364;637 million, depending on the approach taken.</font>  The final report on this review is available on my Department&#8217;s website.</p><p>  Following the review, proposals were recently submitted to Government. These proposals represent a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement that includes:</p><p>- integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office through the establishment of a National Procurement Office (under the aegis of my Department) which will be headed by a Chief Procurement Officer, this position was recently advertised;</p><p> - strengthening spend analytics and data management;</p><p> - examining the specifications set out for goods and services; </p><p> - evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and,</p><p>- strengthening vendor and category management. </p><p>These proposals have now been agreed by Government.</p><p>  These reforms will lead to reductions in the cost of goods and services; better procurement services at lower cost; introduction of technical standardisation; greater attention to contract management and better problem resolution; greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.</p></reply>

The drawdown of exchequer monies through the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department is based on commitments made in a given year and projected draw-downs against those commitments in the year in question.  It must be remembered that drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies (e.g. Competency Centres) is demand-led and can only take place if the company or body in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State at the time of the financial commitment.</p><p>  Due to this demand-led nature of grant payments and issues relating to the timing of expenditure, the bulk of an allocation is often drawn down in the last quarter of the year. It is expected therefore, that the snapshot figure referred to in the Question, will not be reflected in the end of year figure. One example is the new Microfinance Scheme that I launched on 27 September, which is now open for business and will have an associated Exchequer expenditure of &euro;10m before year end. </p><p>  In addition, there are other timing issues around finalising legal agreements with the private sector when setting up funds, for example under the Innovation Fund initiative, which means that while drawdown will take place, it may be pushed back by some months, thereby showing up as an &ldquo;underspend&rdquo; in a particular accounting period.</p><p>  Despite the very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies.  2011 saw an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies, compared with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 6,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream. IDA allocation for Capital Grants for the year 2012 is &euro;85m. The IDA has assured me that they will draw down their entire grant allocation before the end of 2012.</p><p>  Jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, have been secured. Yesterday, the Kerry Group announced the establishment of an industry-leading Global Technology and Innovation Centre in Ireland. This &euro;100m investment will create 800 jobs over the next four years, as well as 400 jobs in the construction phase, which will be part-funded by my Department through Enterprise Ireland.  Job creation is at the core of this Government&rsquo;s policies and the evidence to date in 2012, despite a challenging external environment, is that it will be a strong year for agency outputs in terms of job creation and exports.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.320.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000076#WRQ00700"><p>I can advise the Deputy that, in so far as it is possible to give an estimate at this point of the amount that will be incurred by my Department and its offices by way of legal costs in 2012, this is likely to be in the region of &euro;1m.  This is based on current knowledge and does not include, for instance, any legal proceedings that might be instigated between now and year end 2012, any awards of costs in any cases arising, the timing of payments or any alteration in fees further to any references and examination by legal cost accountants, etc.  </p><p>  I should emphasize also that the estimated costs are inclusive of legal costs incurred by the offices under my Department&rsquo;s aegis, principally the Companies Registration office (CRO), the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA),   in the normal conduct of the enforcement, judicial and regulatory functions carried out by those offices.</p><p>  In responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, a very broad interpretation of the term legal costs has been assumed.  The services that make up the estimated total cost cover a very wide range of legal services including the bill of costs in legal cases taken against the Minister/Department, legal settlements, the provision of legal advices across a wide range of issues in the Department/offices,   the servicing of documentation e.g. signing of affidavits, the prosecution of cases including court appearances and representation.</p><p>  My Department seeks, where possible, to minimise legal costs and has adopted a number of measures to achieve this.  The Department/offices avails of the services of the Chief State Solicitors office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in terms of the provision of legal advice and in terms of representation of the Department/offices in Court cases.  In the case of the ODCE for instance and in line with overall Government policy,   the ODCE obtained a reduction of 8% in legal fees.  The services of legal cost accountants are availed of where fees demanded appear to be high.  Additionally, my Department has recently completed a tendering process for prosecution and civil debt enforcement services in the case of the pursuance of employment rights cases on behalf of individuals which is expected should reduce further the Department&rsquo;s legal costs in 2013 provided the number of cases to be prosecuted does not increase significantly.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that the fundamental problem is that pensions are significantly more expensive due to increasing life expectancy and lower than expected investment returns which are reflected in increased annuity rates. </p><p>  The Pensions Regulator suspended the Funding Standard four years ago, following the downturn in the financial market, to give trustees/employers an opportunity to assess the impact on pension funds and to enable them time to develop responses to the challenge. The re-introduction of the Funding Standard was delayed on a number of occasions pending changes to legislation which were designed to help trustees respond to the funding challenges facing pension schemes. Among the measures introduced at that time was provision for Sovereign Annuities. Sovereign Annuity products are now available and it is expected that the range of products will grow over the coming months.</p><p>  The Funding Standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a scheme can be tested. The existence of the Funding Standard itself is not the central issue in relation to whether a scheme is properly funded. Rather the responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed. However, the Funding Standard does provide the regulatory mechanism for ensuring that a scheme can live up to the &ldquo;promised&rdquo; level of pension benefits.</p><p>  The requirement for a risk reserve is also being introduced from 2016, to provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. It is accepted that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the regulator identifies options which the scheme can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023. This guidance is being kept under review.</p><p>  Reference has been made to the easing of the solvency regime in a number of other countries. It should be noted that the solvency regime even after those changes is still more onerous that the current Irish regime. It should be noted that the changes to the Funding Standard are being implemented over the next 11 years, not immediately. This is the longest recovery period generally allowed in any European country.</p><p>  The Pensions Board recently announced that the timeframe for pension schemes to submit funding proposals has been extended to 30 June 2013. This extension will give schemes additional time to help them address the issues they are facing.</p><p>  Overall, the changes made to defined benefit schemes are intended to lessen schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks and bring increased stability for pension scheme members so that they receive the pension promises in the future.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The average waiting time for new family income supplement (FIS) claims at the end of August is 18 weeks and for renewal claims is 16 weeks.  At the end of August, there were 7,137<b><font color="#FF0000"> </font></b>new FIS applications and 7,511<b></b>renewal applications awaiting approval.  The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full time employment. </p><p>  Claimants must apply to have their payment renewed if they wish to receive payment for a further 52 weeks.  At present, application forms for renewal of the payment of FIS for a further 52 weeks are issued one month in advance of the expiry of the current payment and are processed in order of the date of expiry of the current payment and not by the date of receipt of a completed renewal form.  This is designed to facilitate the collection of the most up-to-date customer information to ensure the fairest calculation of entitlement for the next 52 week payment period of FIS.</p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently commenced for the FIS scheme.  This project will focus on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  Part of the project will be detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received.</p><p>  Following the assessment phase of this BPI project, a plan will be devised and implemented which will allow the normal weekly new claim intake to be processed without delay and the backlog to be ring-fenced and eliminated over a specified target period.  It is expected that the assessment phase of the project will be completed very shortly.</p></reply>

A person wishing to pursue the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.</p><p>  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA, indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  Furthermore, the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.</p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to DSP customers, including BTEA, and it is my intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.</p></reply>

As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.

The figures quoted are estimates based on a variety of assumptions.  A 2009 report by the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA) entitled &ldquo;Jobs and Investment in Irish wind energy&rdquo; estimated that the wind energy sector in Ireland can support 1.5 jobs per MW installed.  At the end of 2011, 17.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was from renewable sources, with approximately 1900MW installed.</p><p>  At an EU level, the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) analysis found that there are 15 jobs created per MW - wind turbine and component manufacturing provide the majority of employment opportunities at circa 59% of direct employment.  These elements represent 12.5 of the 15.1 jobs created in the EU for every MW installed.  Ireland&rsquo;s ability to harness a high level of employment from renewable energy projects would depend, to a large extent, on related industry such as turbine and cable manufacturing industry relocating to Ireland.</p><p>  The development of renewable energy in Ireland is being pursued in line with our obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive, that 16% of all energy consumed in the State must be from renewable sources by 2020.</p><p>  This is a legally binding obligation introduced by the EU to ensure that our climate and energy goals of reducing CO2 emissions and increasing security of energy supply can be achieved by 2020.  In the event that Member States fall short of their national renewable targets, the Directive provides that they will be obliged to purchase renewable energy credits from other Member States that have exceeded their targets, at a price that is not yet known.  </p><p>  In the electricity sector, 17.6% of electricity consumed was from renewables in 2011, in the transport sector 3.6% of energy consumed was biofuels and in the heating sector 5% of energy consumed was from renewable sources (mainly biomass and shallow geothermal.)  The total of the renewable energy consumed in 2011 across the three sectors amounted to 6.5% of all energy.  The objective, in order to meet our 2020 binding targets are to increase renewable energy consumption in those sectors to 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heating sector, which together will mean the 16% overall target can be reached.</p><p>  Onshore wind rather than offshore wind will be the major mechanism towards the meeting of our 2020 target.  This is because the cost per MW for offshore wind is significantly higher than onshore wind and a higher feed in tariff (REFIT) for offshore wind would have had to be provided, funded through the PSO levy.</p><p>  The potential for export of renewable electricity was outlined in the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020 which I published earlier in the year.  The mechanisms by which renewable energy can be exported or traded with another country are provided for under the Renewable Energy Directive in Articles 6-12 on co-operation mechanisms.  Countries can agree statistical transfer, which involves the purchase of renewable credits by the importing country in order to meet their target or they can agree joint projects which involves identifying specific projects for the purpose of renewable trading and agreeing how the projects will be financed and how the renewable value will be counted towards each country&rsquo;s renewable target under the Directive.</p><p>  The use of these co-operation mechanisms under the Directive requires formal agreement between two or more Governments.  I have had a number of bilateral discussions with my UK counterpart in this regard as well as some discussion under the auspices of the British Irish Council.  We are actively exploring the possibility of trade in renewable energy between the two jurisdictions, with a view to reaching an agreement that would provide for that.</p><p>  It will be necessary to ensure that Irish consumers do not have to foot the bill for renewable electricity that is exported to the UK and that there are real benefits from renewable trade accruing to the Irish State and Irish consumers.  Renewable developers will only pursue an investment if they can finance the investment and usually this involves a guaranteed minimum price for 15 or 20 years over which time they can repay the loan for the capital outlay.</p><p>  In the event that renewable power was being exported to the UK, for example, it would be necessary to ensure that the costs associated with new transmission infrastructure to export the power and the cost of a support scheme for renewable developers is paid for by UK consumers, rather than Irish consumers who would not be benefitting from either the power or the renewable value of the electricity.</p><p>  The current market price for electricity in the SEM is approximately &euro;65MWh.  The capital costs of offshore wind are high.  Offshore wind developers would need a significantly higher guaranteed price more than the current market price for electricity in order to finance an offshore wind project and to finance new transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity generated by such a project to the marketplace.</p><p>  A loan to finance a project is only helpful insofar as the project has a reasonable prospect of earning sufficient revenue from the project to pay off the loan over time.  The current market prices in Ireland and the UK would be insufficient in the case of an offshore wind project. If the UK or another market wanted to import power from an offshore wind project under the cooperation mechanisms in the Directive, so that they could count some or all of the output towards their target, they would need to be willing to offer a sufficient support price to the project developer over a defined period to make the investment viable.  This is an area that the UK Government is currently examining as part of their market reform.</p><p>  If the Irish Government decides to enter an Inter-Governmental agreement under the Directive with the UK or another Government, it will have to ensure sufficient return to the State from such projects.  This might include a share of the renewable value or the imposition of a royalty of some type.</p><p>  The Irish State Companies, notably ESB and BGE already have a significant presence in the onshore wind energy sector.  Further investment in wind energy would be a matter for the companies themselves, taking full account of their commercial remit.</p></reply>

In 2011, 6.5% of all energy we consumed in the State was from renewable sources.  The development of renewable energy in Ireland is being pursued in line with our obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive, to have 16% of all energy consumed in the State to be from renewable sources by 2020.  This is a legally binding obligation introduced by the EU to ensure that our climate and energy goals of reducing CO2 emissions and increasing security of energy supply can be achieved by 2020.  In the event that Member States fall short of their national renewable targets, the Directive provides that they will be obliged to purchase renewable energy credits from other Member States that have exceeded their targets, at a price that is not yet known.</p><p>  In the electricity sector, 17.6% of electricity consumed was from renewables in 2011, in the transport sector 3.6% of energy consumed was biofuels and in the heating sector 5% of energy consumed was from renewable sources (mainly biomass and shallow geothermal.)

Our intention, in order to meet our 2020 binding targets are to increase renewable energy consumption in those sectors to 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heating sector, which together will mean our 16% overall target can be reached.</p><p>  In the electricity sector, which makes the greatest contribution to our renewable energy consumption, Ireland has approximately 1900MW of renewable generation connected to the electricity grid.  This consists of existing large hydro plants such as Ardnacrusha, as well as wind and biomass sourced generation.  Six tender competitions were run from the mid 1990s to the mid 2000s through a scheme known as AER (Alternative Energy Requirement) to incentivise renewable generation across different technologies.  This guaranteed the winning tenders 10 or 15 years of support at the winning price.  Under the AER schemes, 532MW of renewable generation was built out. </p><p>  In 2006 a new scheme known as REFIT was introduced.  REFIT operates by guaranteeing a minimum floor price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The original REFIT scheme was to cater for 1450MW of wind sourced generation, small hydro, landfill gas and biomass generated electricity.  Two new REFIT schemes were introduced in 2012 &ndash; one to encourage biomass sourced generation including anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power and one to encourage wind sourced generation, small hydro and landfill gas.  The REFIT and AER schemes are funded through the PSO levy that is funded by all electricity consumers.</p><p>  The above is the basis for our renewable energy development to date.  Separate to the above, there has been a certain level of public funding allocated to the wave and tidal energy sector in recent years.  Ocean Energy was recently identified as a priority area in the research prioritisation exercised undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, given its potential for the development of a future industrial sector here.  The development of ocean energy has been pursued in line with the 2006 Ocean Energy Strategy published by my Department.</p><p>  This wave and tidal sector is still at the research and development phase and is not yet commercially viable.  The Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) in Cork has a wave test tank where early stage devices can be tested and has developed a systematic protocol for the scaling up and testing of wave technology. Certain third level institutions are engaged in ocean energy research across the Irish university system. </p><p>  SEAI&rsquo;s ocean energy development unit has been engaged in a series of tasks to encourage the ocean energy sector, including through the administration of a prototype development fund of grants whereby up to 50% co-funding for scale testing and other research in the ocean area has been provided to industry.  ESB has been involved in the Westwave project, which has had as a goal to install and operate wave energy converters capable of generating 5MW of clean electricity by 2015. SEAI together with the Marine Institute has been involved in the development of a wave test site in Galway Bay, where quarter scale prototypes can be tested and the Marine Institute, together with IBM has been involved in the SmartBay project, creating ICT links with the development of ocean energy.</p><p>The public funding for ocean energy to date has been focussed on research, development and demonstration as technologies in this area are not commercially viable.

Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.  Since the scheme commenced in March 2009 the SEAI has disbursed almost &euro;143m in grants and supported the installation of over 333,000 such measures in 131,850 homes.</p><p>  Better Energy Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the SEAI and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Since the commencement of the Programme in 2000 energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 86,302 homes amounting to &euro;87 million in Exchequer funding.</p><p>  Better Energy Workplaces evaluates new approaches for implementing sustainable energy upgrades to existing facilities in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  By accelerating the scale and depth of retrofit across these sectors the programme aims to create energy efficiency exemplar projects. The scheme disbursed &euro;11 million in grants in 2011, co-financed 85 projects and supported 250 jobs.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.</p><p>  My Department and the SEAI have also established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded. Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI. Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.</p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy. Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target. This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.</p><p>  Finally, the recently adopted Energy Efficiency Directive will translate elements of the European Efficiency Plan into binding measures on Member States, including an annual rate of renovation for central Government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central Government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; and an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance.  The 3% renovation target for central Government buildings represents a challenge for the Office of Public Works (OPW), however the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  We will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge . The household charge applies to residential property generally, including those properties that are liable to the &euro;200 charge on non-principal private residences.</p><p>  The payment date for payment of the household charge was 31 March 2012. The penalties for late payment are proportionate to the level of the household charge and are similar to the provisions that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes. Failure to pay by the due date results in late payment interest and late payment fees.</p><p>  The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, introduced a charge on non-principal private residences. The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. Payment of the charge for 2012 was due on or before the 30th June 2012. However, the charge has been in place since 2009 and therefore substantial payment and late payment fees may be owed from previous years. Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. </p><p>  It should be noted that failure to declare a liability in respect of, or to fail to pay, the household charge and/or the charge on non-principal private residences, are offences. I would urge all liable parties who have not paid the household change and/or the charge on non-principal private residences   to contact their local authority as a matter of urgency. Property owners who are unsure of their liability should, in the first instance, contact their local authority.</p></reply>

An Implementation Group was established in September 2011 to oversee planning, preparatory work and initial implementation of the reorganisation process.  The Group submitted an Implementation Plan in June 2012, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website at .</p><p>  The Implementation Group identified estimated savings of &#8364;6.15m per annum arising from amalgamation. The Implementation Plan proposes estimated once - off costs of &#8364;1.79m and annual costs of &#8364;0.56m arising from harmonisation of rates across both Councils.  The Implementation Plan proposes that savings be thoroughly reviewed during the implementation phase and I have asked that the potential to maximise savings be examined in that context, including scope for new arrangements, efficiencies and economies of scale in the context of the unified authority.</p><p>  The Implementation Plan also sets out details of a new service delivery model for a unified council which involves the streamlining of functions, while also addressing issues such as the duplication of services, maintaining local service delivery and improving council/customer interaction.  I am satisfied that the amalgamation of authorities in Tipperary will provide for a more effective and coherent delivery of services, reduced administrative costs and overheads and, most importantly, stronger and more efficient local government in the county.</p></reply>

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guideline s to local authorities, based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in July 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.</p><p>  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.  I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.</p></reply>

The Report, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website at .

The Framework requires local authorities to prepare severe weather plans and flood emergency plans, as sub-plans of their Major Emergency Plan.  I understand that all local authorities have Severe Weather Plans in place and, where appropriate in accordance with local risk assessment, Flood Emergency Plans.

Within this context, every effort is made by my Department to keep costs to a minimum through, inter alia, proper management of legal cases, use of dedicated expertise in other public bodies (Attorney General&rsquo;s Office (Advisory Counsel), Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, State Claims Agency) and competitive tendering for external legal services where these are required. It is estimated that legal costs in 2012 may be of the order of &euro;1.7m, excluding costs associated with the Planning Tribunal.</p></reply>

That is clear from the extent of the Garda operations launched against gangs as well as the many drug seizures that have taken place in recent months and weeks.</p><p>  I should also mention the more recently released recorded crime statistics, which show that most categories of crime are in fact falling, which also reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These figures showed that in the 12 month period to end June, murder had decreased by 8% and assault offences were down by 9.7%.</p><p>  We should not underestimate the difficulties the Garda&iacute; face in trying to prevent gangland killings and related crimes and in bringing the perpetrators to justice. These crimes are carefully planned and are carried out by people who are very familiar with criminal and forensic investigation techniques. Moreover, even where members of gangs are clearly at risk not only will they generally not cooperate with Garda&iacute; but, in fact, they will do everything they can to avoid Garda attention.</p><p>  Despite the difficulties which they encounter, we should remember that week in week out the Garda&iacute; are successfully bringing people involved in gangland activities before the Courts, disrupting their activities, making seizures and securing convictions. Thanks to these operations a substantial number are presently serving sentences in prison.</p><p>  It is misleading to characterise this as a question of resources. There has been gang and gun violence for some time in Ireland, and the number of murders was in fact higher when Garda numbers were higher than they are now. Despite the constraints on public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place and these must be seen in the context of the programme of real reform which is being delivered in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Croke Park Agreement. The Garda Commissioner and the members of the Force have my full support in continuing to confront gangland violence and criminality and in bringing those involved to justice.</p></reply>

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that over 1,700 persons have been arrested and that almost 1,000 persons have been charged in the first six months of the Operation, reflecting the substantial efforts being made by the Garda&iacute; to tackle those involved in burglary and property crimes in all parts of the country.</p><p>  I am further informed that the area referred to by the Deputy is subject to patrols by local and district uniform and plain clothes personnel, supplemented as necessary by Divisional plain clothes personnel, the Divisional Traffic Corps and Regional Support Units.  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  In this regard, the Garda Commissioner recently launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo;. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention information and advice, to operate alongside targeted policing responses to burglary.</p><p>  I am further advised that, while the situation is being kept under review, Garda management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the residents of the area referred to.</p></reply>

During the period 2002 to date, there have been 53 deaths of asylum seekers who were residing in direct provision accommodation prior to their deaths.</p><p>While RIA may have general knowledge of the cause of death - perhaps by way of information arising from the specified medical needs of the resident concerned prior to his or her death - it does not, indeed cannot, hold or have access to death certificates.  In most cases, the deaths would have occurred outside the asylum centres themselves e.g. in hospitals.  If the HSE or a Coroner were to raise an issue relating to the accommodation in which a deceased person lived prior to their death - and this has never happened - then RIA would respond accordingly.  Where information is provided to centre managers by relatives or friends of the deceased, this is recorded by RIA and indicates that the causes of death ranged from cancers, heart conditions to traffic accidents and, in the case of deaths of children under the age of five, it is believed that a number were suspected cot deaths and still births.  Given previous misinterpretations of statistics provided in this respect, it is important to say that only one of these deaths can with certainty be said to be a suicide and that involved a newly arrived asylum seeker taking his own life in 2008 while in hospital.</p><p>The number of asylum seekers who died while being provided with accommodation by RIA in direct provision centres and an age breakdown for those persons are set out as follows.</p><p><pli4><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Number of deaths </div></th><th></th><th><div>Age Range</div></th><th><div>Number</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2002</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td>0 - 5 yrs</td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2003</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td></td><td>6 - 10 yrs</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2004</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td>11 - 15 yrs</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2005</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td>16 - 20 yrs</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2006</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td></td><td>21 - 25 yrs</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2007</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td></td><td>26 - 30 yrs</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2008</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td></td><td>31 - 35 yrs</td><td><div>9</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2009</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td>36 - 40 yrs</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2010</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td></td><td>41 - 45 yrs</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2011</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td></td><td>46 - 50 yrs</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2012 *</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td></td><td>51 - 55 yrs</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>53</div></td><td></td><td>56 - 60 yrs</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>* To date in 2012</td><td></td><td></td><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>53</div></td></tr></table></pli4></p><p>While all of these deaths are, of course, tragic, RIA has provided accommodation for over 50,000 persons over the course of the twelve years the direct provision policy has been in place, and the numbers of deaths need to be viewed proportionately and against this background.</p><p>It needs to be recorded  that the above relates only to asylum seekers living in the Direct Provision system.  Some asylum seekers choose not to avail of the Direct Provision system and stay with friends or relatives. It is possible that, during the period in question, there could have been deaths among this cohort but such data is not available to RIA.</p></reply>

It is not possible to indicate how many of these were Irish citizen children; however the likelihood is that the number was small.  It is also important to note that Deportation Orders are not issued in respect of Irish citizen children and that when they leave the State they do so in the company of their parents and/or guardians.  These flights are either charter flights arranged by INIS or through shared arrangements organised through the FRONTEX network which is an EU organisation established to coordinate repatriation activities between EU countries to ensure that humanitarian standards are met and to maximise efficiency and cost-effectiveness in joint return operations.  Destination countries include Nigeria, Dr. Congo, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Georgia, Russia and Ghana.  Other statistics and information of the nature sought by the Deputy are not maintained by my Department. In any event, my Department would not be aware of the circumstances of persons once they have been repatriated to their country of origin.</p><p>  Enforcement of the law in relation to deportations is an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is exercised by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  I am advised that the GNIB operate a policy of zero restraint on all persons being deported and that the question of restraining persons only arises in the context of maintaining public safety, is always proportional and is a relatively rare event.  The safety of all persons in these situations is of paramount importance and in this regard I would be anxious to hear from the Deputy if he has any specific situation in mind.  </p><p>  I might add that persons who are illegally in the State are required by law to remove themselves.

It is not possible to predict the expected total outlay for the remainder of 2012 as legal costs have still to be decided by the courts or submitted for payment. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, a drive to reduce expenditure and increase efficiency across all government Departments is being led by my colleague Minister Brendan Howlin in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government has decided to undertake a comprehensive review of the level of public spending on legal services, and the manner in which public bodies procure those services. This review covers both direct employment of solicitors, engaging solicitors or barristers for particular cases and other related items of expenditure that arise from time to time.  The review is currently underway and is being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>  The Legal Services Regulation Bill currently before the Oireachtas, makes provision, mainly in Part 9, for a new legal costs regime which will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged with greater balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those clients who avail of their services - including Government departments. The Bill also sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule 1 and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account if disputed costs are submitted for adjudication. For the first time, these cost transparency measures will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors. </p><p>  Under the Bill it will no longer be permissible to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business. It will no longer be permissible to charge Junior Counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees. Legal practitioners will now be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, it must disclose the costs involved, or, where this is not practicable, the basis upon which costs are to be calculated with a cooling-off period for consideration by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs the client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.</p><p>  The Bill also provides that a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will deal with disputes about legal costs &ndash; at present these are dealt with by the Office of the Taxing-Master. The new Office, headed by a Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator, will modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated.  The Office will be empowered to prepare Legal Costs Guidelines for the guidance of Legal Costs Adjudicators, legal practitioners and the public and these will be published. It will establish and maintain a Register of Determinations which will include the outcomes and reasons for its determinations about disputed legal costs and these will be made public.</p><p>  I am confident that both the outcome of the comprehensive review of the level of public spending on legal service, currently underway in the Department of Expenditure and Reform, and the relevant provisions contained in the Legal Services Regulation Bill, will establish the general framework wherein legal services can be procured by the State at best value as well as the transparency required to facilitate the ongoing management and control of legal costs by my Department and, indeed, the State.</p></reply>

I am conscious that farmers need money in their hands because of the poor summer and because of cash flow problems some of them are experiencing at the moment.  I am responding to these pressures within the funds available to me.  I recently announced the reopening of the Agri-Environment Options Scheme, AEOS, to new entrants.  I am providing &euro;20 million for AEOS, which will open shortly for applications.  The scheme will build on the success of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and both AEOS 1 and 2 in delivering an annual income to farmers in return for farming to high environmental standards.  A maximum payment of &euro;4,000 per annum will apply to individual applicants under the reopened scheme.  As the average payment in the past has been lower than the maximum payment, I am confident that up to 6,000 new participants can be accepted into the scheme.  I have received EU approval for the advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment.  This will enable payment to issue immediately following 15 October and will represent the early payment of some &euro;600 million to farmers.</p><p>  I fully appreciate the value and importance of the other scheme payments to farmers.  I remain committed to ensuring the maximum numbers are paid at the earliest possible date, mindful of the overriding necessity to ensure compliance with the governing EU requirements.  Payments worth &euro;161 million under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme began on 26 September last.  This funding will provide a boost to the rural economy and will benefit all areas of the country.  It is too early to estimate at this stage the level of total payments which will be made under this scheme in 2012 because an issue relating to qualification criteria is working through the system.  REPS payments are up to date.  A total of &euro;64 million has been paid out to date.  I envisage that a further &euro;121 million will be spent by the end of 2012.  AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.  Some &euro;23 million has been paid to date.  I expect that a further &euro;34 million will be paid out before the end of 2012.  My intention is to ensure that payments in respect of 2012 are made on the earliest possible date.  Teagasc has been very active in providing advice and assistance for farmers affected by the bad weather.  All Teagasc offices are taking calls from concerned farmers.  A series of public meetings were held across the country in September to address fodder, financial and social aspects of weather crisis.  Weather clinics were also held in all Teagasc offices.  Newsletters and media articles were prepared to outline the options open to farmers who are facing difficulties.</p></reply>

The conditions governing the eligibility of land are outlined clearly by my Department in the Terms and Condition of the Scheme. In this context, an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo; is land that is used for an agricultural activity and includes land used to grow cereals, oilseeds, short rotation coppice, miscanthus sinensis, protein crops, sugar beet, maize, fodder beet, turnips, mangolds, kale, vegetables, potatoes, grass for silage or hay or grazing.  REPS areas such as newly created habitats under option 4a of REPS 3 and REPS 4, areas under linnet and riparian zones are also eligible for SPS.</p><p>  For land to be eligible, a number of further conditions have to be complied with, namely:</p><p>-	The land must be used and managed by the applicant.  The land must be suitable for and compatible with the farming enterprise;</p><p>-	There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery.  Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable;</p><p>-	There must be appropriate fencing for the farming enterprise.  Appropriate fencing means stockproof fencing that will control the applicant&rsquo;s animals and also the neighbouring farmer&rsquo;s animals. In mountain/hill areas this generally means sheep fencing;</p><p>-	There must be defined external boundaries except in the case of commonage;</p><p>-	If at inspection the applicant claims to be farming the land with animals then the type of animals must be appropriate to the land and there must be appropriate handling facilities available to meet the animals&rsquo; welfare requirements.</p><p>-	The releasing of animals onto a parcel without conducting the normal husbandry and welfare practices throughout the year does not satisfy the requirement of an agricultural activity  and will be deemed to be in breach of Article 30 of Council Regulation 73/2009</p><p>-	There must be evidence of an agricultural activity being conducted throughout the parcel, otherwise the unused part of the parcel may be found to be ineligible. This can arise where the stocking rate is too low.</p></reply>

The level of expenditure actually incurred under this heading in any one year is largely outside of the Department&rsquo;s control.  My Department endeavours to minimise costs by defending any actions brought against it.  In addition, where the Department looses a case, the legal costs awarded against it are carefully assessed by the cost accountants in the Chief State Solicitors&rsquo; Office or sent for taxation before the taxing master.</p></reply>

The Education Welfare Service, and its network of Education Welfare Officers (EWOs), is a key resource for the Board in delivering on this statutory remit.</p><p>  The Board&#8217;s remit was extended by Government in 2009 to include strategic and operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme.  Under this extended remit the Board was tasked with developing a single strategic approach to attendance, participation and retention in the education system.  In working to deliver this integrated approach to school support services the Board is committed to the principle of &#8220;<i>One Child, One Team, One Plan</i>&#8221;.  This integration process is a core element of the NEWB work practice reforms being negotiated under the Croke Park Implementation Plan.</p><p>  I am advised by the Board that the integration project itself involves a large scale change management process, a formalised structured project management approach and the development of a model of integrated work practice for all of the services, including the Education Welfare Service.  The project is been progressed towards implementation in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including staff-side representatives.</p><p>  I am further advised by the Board that as a new model of integrated working is rolled out over 2012/2013, it will lead to operational efficiencies and it will take a significant step forward in realising the Board's goal for an integrated delivery of service to support improved educational outcomes for children.</p></reply>

As part of this assessment the Adoption Authority has reviewed a draft bilateral agreement presented to it during previous discussions with its Russian counterparts and has provided me with an initial assessment in this regard.  I have asked the Adoption Authority to have further exploratory talks with the Russian authorities focussing on areas of concern in order that the Authority may progress its assessment of the situation and provide a definitive recommendation to me on the feasibility of formally opening discussion with the Russian Federation under Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010.</p><p>  Further information on intercountry adoption from Russia can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie).</p></reply>

Separately, SDU collates the number of patients waiting 0-6 hours, 6-9 hours, 9-18 hours and over 18 hours, in order to allow detailed analysis of patient attendance and admittance patterns in Emergency Departments.  These detailed figures are collected three times daily, 7 days per week, and shared with hospitals on an operational basis.</p><p>  The waiting times are calculated from the time a decision to admit the patient is made in the ED to the time the patient is admitted to the hospital.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-10a.631.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012101000088#WRCC01800"><p>It is important to note that across the acute hospital sector as a whole, reduction in costs will come from greater efficiencies where possible, including shorter Average Length of Stay (AvLOS) which is key to the delivery of agreed activity levels with fewer beds, and therefore less staffing. This in turn reduces the number of bed days needed. This year, general AvLOS has been reduced from 7.2 days to the HSE Target Plan of 5.8 days. In particular, implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Medicine Clinical Care Programme has saved 121,000 bed days to date in 2012.   The HSE transitional care initiative is also instrumental in shortening unduly lengthy and inappropriate stays in acute beds for patients, by putting in place 190 transitional care beds and 150 rehabilitation beds this year to which patients can move when appropriate. In terms of surgery, the realignment of services away from in-patient and towards day-case services is in line with international best practice:  2012 has, for the first time, seen agreed targets with all specialties in relation to AvLOS and day case rates for surgical care.  The continued implementation of these Programmes and Initiatives is improving access to services, quality of care and the cost-effectiveness of the service provision.  </p><p>  The funding pressures now being experienced in the health services mean that the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. This means that we must concentrate on maximising efficiency and getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. However, this on its own is not sufficient. Activity levels in our acute hospitals have been running ahead of the levels set in the approved HSE Service Plan and therefore it is inevitable that activity levels must also be reduced. This will be a significant challenge, and in meeting it we must be flexible and responsive to service needs, in order to ensure that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount. </p><p>  During 2012, as part of its performance improvement role, the SDU committed limited funds for short periods of time to facilitate the reduction of numbers waiting on trolleys in Emergency Departments, where these numbers were determined to be exceptionally high. Some of the  funding provided was directed towards measures for patients whose length of stay had been prolonged due to lack of immediately available assistance and/or accommodation in order to facilitate an appropriate discharge.  The types of measures utilised include temporary funding of nursing home beds, purchase of temporary home care or assisted discharge packages, increased access to diagnostic facilities and additional staffing for weekend and holiday periods.  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to ensure that the contingency plans are operating satisfactorily and that all critical front line services continue to be delivered across all regions.  This includes using the provision of the Public Service Agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, and maximising redeployment to achieve more efficient delivery of services.  Staff resources will continue to be allocated to areas of greatest priority.  </p></reply>

This included a halving of permitted self-certified sick leave to a maximum of seven days in a  rolling two-year period.  Certified sick-leave for circumstances other than critical illness will be halved from 2014 to a maximum of 3 months on full pay followed by 3 months on half pay in any rolling 4 year period.</p></reply>

There are currently two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits, and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to themselves and their dependents without undue hardship.  There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons who have cancer.</p><p>  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  There is an emergency process for a person who is terminally ill, or in urgent need of medical attention and cannot afford to pay for it, that provides a card within 24 hours while the normal application process is completed.  Once a letter from the patient's GP or consultant is received, stating that the person is terminally ill, and the required personal details are provided an emergency card is issued to that person for a six-month period.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  This includes gluten-free products.</p><p>  Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.

Separate application forms are available for children. </p><p>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p></reply>
