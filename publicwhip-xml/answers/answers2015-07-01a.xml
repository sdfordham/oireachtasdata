    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100076#WRA00500"><p>As requested by the Deputy I append a table to this reply which will set out the volumes of milk purchased by registered milk purchasers in Ireland for the months of January to May in both 2014 and 2015.  My Department does not collect the data on a county or regional format, because most milk purchasers collect milk across many different counties.</p><p>During the period from January to May 2014 some 2.29bn litres of raw milk was collected by registered milk purchasers.  During the same period in 2015 some 2.45bn litres was collected, representing an increase of 7%.</p><p>Focusing on the two months since milk quotas were abolished, April and May 2015, we see that the volume of milk collected in those months was 1.65bn litres.  When compared against the 1.47bn litres collected in the corresponding months of 2014, that is a 12.2 % increase in the volume of milk collected.</p><p>This represents a significant increase in milk production in Ireland and confirms the view widely held by both the dairy sector and market analysts that the milk quota regime acted as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  This indicates that we are well on the way to achieving the 50% increase envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>We have been planning, with stakeholders, for the post quota period for a number of years now and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter this new era with full confidence.  With respect to the super levy bill, flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years and I have just recently announced a Scheme which gives effect to this facility.  This will be of major assistance to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cashflow burden of paying their superlevy bill.  I have also announced a number of other major initiatives for the dairy sector, including just this week a &euro;50m investment scheme for on-farm capital investments as well as other RDP measures for the sector such as knowledge transfer schemes for 10,000 dairy farmers.</p><p>While there is still some softness in the global dairy markets, most analysts predict that medium term prospects are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.  Price volatility is a challenge and, while EU market supports remain in place, it is also critically important that processors, farmers and the banking system work together to mitigate any negative impact. <table><tr><th>Month </th><th>2014 ('000 litres) </th><th>2015 ('000 litres) </th></tr><tr><td>January </td><td>125,588 </td><td>108,114 </td></tr><tr><td>February </td><td>225,390 </td><td>229,205 </td></tr><tr><td>March </td><td>467,362 </td><td>463,587 </td></tr><tr><td>April </td><td>681,548 </td><td>761,214 </td></tr><tr><td>May </td><td>788,667 </td><td>889,330 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTALS </td><td>2,288,555 </td><td>2,451,450 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  Last year was a particularly difficult year with 30 deaths on Irish farms and already there have been eight fatal farm accidents in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Farm Safety Scheme, with a budget of &euro;12.2m, was open for applications between the 22 October 2014 and the 9 January 2015.  During this time 6,299 applications were received.  As of last Friday 26 June, 4,618 applications had been approved, with an average of 4 items per approval.  The most common items approved to date are head-scoops to prevent cattle from moving their heads while in a crush, and yard lights.  These two items are included in 46% and 43% of approvals respectively. </p>  <p>  Of the remaining applications, over 800 are ineligible and the others are being processed as quickly as possible, allowing for issues that have been queried with farmers. </p>  <p>  All work must be completed and a payment claim lodged with the Department by the 31st August 2015. </p>  <p>  While the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has primary responsibility for Health and Safety on farms, I am fully supportive of their work and my Department are active members of the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee.  Looking forward, investment in farm safety will continue to be a priority for my Department.  Under the new Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme the full range of items available under existing Farm Safety Scheme will continue to be supported, along with an increased range of fixed safety items, such as fixed cattle crushes.  This scheme will be launched over the summer as part of the TAMS II round of on-farm investment schemes, funded under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of all of the new TAMS Schemes it will be mandatory for all applicants to have completed a minimum half-day farm safety course before they can claim grant-aid.   </p>  <p>  Further, there are &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by my Department for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures.  These specifications set out the minimum standard to which grant-aided structures must be completed and are freely available to all farmers undertaking construction works. </p>  <p>  In addition to the grant-aid schemes, there will be a mandatory Health and Safety element included in all Knowledge Transfer Groups under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  These groups will directly engage in the region of 27,000 farmers with farm safety.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100076#WRA01200"><p>I welcome the fact that nearly 27,000 applications were submitted in the first tranche of GLAS applications, which is very much in line with the projections I made when launching the scheme.  Farmers have shown a keen interest in the Scheme and have worked along with their advisors to apply in significant numbers. In doing so they have committed to actions and farming prescriptions which are expected to deliver substantial environmental benefits in the years ahead.  These actions will improve and maintain our water quality, will encourage biodiversity and the maintenance of valuable habitats, while also promoting climate change mitigation.  These farmers are the custodians of our farmed landscape and in joining GLAS they are continuing the important conservation work which has already been carried out in previous agri-environment schemes.</p>  <p>  The management of our uplands by means of commonage management plans is given the highest priority in GLAS and I welcome the fact 3,934 applications by commonage farmers were received in the first tranche.  A total of 34 farmers with commonage land in County Wexford have applied to join GLAS. There are a total of 24 commonages in Wexford, and the applications received cover 15 of these, or 63% of all commonages in the county.  I am very happy with this level of take-up in the first tranche of the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  The proposed commonage management plans are a major step towards the establishment of greatly enhanced management regimes for these upland areas.  While it is clear that in general there are commonage farmers who have not yet applied for the Scheme, many of those who have not yet joined are in AEOS and intend to see these contracts out before joining GLAS.  Others may have waited in order to see if a commonage management plan is commenced on their particular commonage.  This option was open to farmers, given that commonage management plans can be joined at a later date and that priority access remains open to these farmers.</p>  <p>  I am very optimistic that the numbers of commonage farmers applying to join GLAS will increase significantly over time.  A phased recruitment to both GLAS and to the various Commonage Management Plans was anticipated in the scheme design, and specific provision has been made to accommodate these farmers on that basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100076#WRA01400"><p>I assume the Deputy is referring primarily to the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP).  As the Deputy is aware the BDGP forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and allocates funding of some &euro;300 million over the next six years to suckler farmers in Ireland.  The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in Ireland in recent years.  It will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the national beef herd, which is an objective I believe we all should share.</p>  <p>  The BDGP was launched on the 5 May and my Department received just under 30,000 applications by the extended closing date of 5 June.  While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, I am delighted to record that the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed.  This level of interest is, I believe, a vindication of our efforts to further improve suckler farming.  It is also testimony to the commitment of suckler farms in Ireland to continuous improvement and their openness to innovation where it can deliver real measurable benefits.</p>  <p>  The BDGP is the next logical step in the development of our suckler herd.  It builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to the majority of farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements. </p>  <p>  Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  Program participants can contact my Department directly with any specific queries they may have regarding scheme conditions.  They will also receive additional information specific to their herds in the coming weeks from ICBF which will provide a useful overview of the current euro star ratings of the animals on their herds.  This will then be followed by dedicated training courses which scheme participants will be paid to attend. </p>  <p>  I know that concerns have been raised by different farming organisations, including the Irish Farmer&rsquo;s Association, and where possible I have moved to address the concerns raised.  Additional flexibility has been included to permit the use of 2015, as opposed to 2014, as the base year for payments, with this to be decided on a case by case basis.  The concerns regarding scheme exit have also been considered and my Department has confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds.  Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the Programme, he or she is required to continue to meet the terms of the Programme. </p>  <p>  Finally, I have committed to a mid-term review of the operation of the programme, which will include input from all of the stakeholders, including farm organisations.  For now, I would like to welcome the 30,000 or so applicants to the scheme and assure them of continued support over the lifetime of the scheme from my Deaprtment, Teagasc and ICBF so that they may derive maximum benefit from the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100076#WRA01600"><p>I attach an enormous importance to the live export trade and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been extremely proactive during my tenure as Minister in encouraging and facilitating both the cross border live trade and shipments overseas. Live exports serve a vital purpose as a means of both satisfying market demand for live animals and providing essential alternative market outlet, particularly for Irish cattle producers.</p><p>Total live exports of cattle for 2014 stood at approximately 237,000 head, valued at &euro;172 million. Some 73,000 of these were exported to the UK.  Trade to the UK has increased considerably so far this year, with live cattle exports to the UK as a whole standing at about 31,000 head, representing a 25% rise when compared to the comparable period in 2014.  This figure includes live exports to Northern Ireland, with cross-border trade up almost 45% on last year.  This trade has been assisted by the relative strength of sterling in recent months and the considerable increase reflected in the figures presents strong grounds for optimism regarding the future of the live export trade of cattle to this important market.</p><p><b><i>A strong system of transport links is in place to facilitate these exports and extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock exports has been added since the beginning of the year.  Three dedicated vessels and three roll-on roll-off ships are currently approved for export of live animals from Ireland.  The process to approve two more dedicated vessels for the purpose of exporting animals is also underway.</i></b></p><p>There had been some concern expressed last year regarding the impact of origin labelling rules on the level of cattle that could be exported north of the border or to the rest of Britain.  The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately and, under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, and packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor.  These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in Britain, and of British retailers.  However, I believe the developments in recent months demonstrate that the impact of origin labelling rules can sometimes be overstated and, where good quality animals are made available at the right price, there is clearly a market there for them. </p><p>With this in mind, Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all possible opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.  This is in addition to actively supporting the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department emails application forms to previous recipients of funding and to persons/bodies working in animal care who may have contacted the Department during the course of the year and expressed an interest in being considered for grant assistance.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2014, my Department provided funding of &euro;1.8m to 142 organisations involved in delivering animal welfare services throughout the country.  The awards in 2014 provided increased funding for the fourth year in a row and reflected the fact that 2014 was a challenging year, with continuing reports of animal cruelty highlighting the need to assist animal welfare organisations in their work. </p>  <p>  Advertisements in respect of funding for 2015 were placed in the national press on 21 May 2015 with a closing date of 26 June 2015 for receipt of the completed application forms.  The application form requires details of the nature of the organisation&rsquo;s work, premises, capacity to hold animals, the species cared for, number of years in operation and details of fundraising programmes.  Applicants are also required to submit supporting documentation, including detailed financial accounts.  Depending on the size of the organisation, these can be statements of income and expenditure for a 12 month period, certified or audited accounts.  Organisations must also submit an up to date tax clearance certificate and/or a registered charity number.  Applicants may also be subject to an inspection by the Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  The criteria for awarding funding includes a range of factors such as:</p>  <p> - Veterinary Inspector reports detailing level of service provided and impact of organisation in particular catchment area;</p>  <p> - income position of the organisation versus its level of expenditure together with its level of activity in the area of animal welfare and its level of funding raised from other sources to support welfare activities;</p>  <p> - an undertaking on the part of the animal welfare bodies to comply with a code of practice which sets out best practice for dealing with animal welfare. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these criteria are soundly based and that the funding allocated under this scheme provides very necessary support for these organisations in the promotion of good animal welfare practices and in dealing with real animal welfare issues on a daily basis.</p></reply>

Simply put, this provides that Member States in a region will work together to develop measures appropriate for the region.  The Member States work with the stakeholders through the new Advisory Councils to devise and implement measures that work for the types of fisheries in the region.  The process provides that there must be a unanimous agreement among the regional Member States before a recommendation is submitted to the Commission for adoption.</p>  <p>  The Regulation provides that Member States in the region having a direct management interest affected by the planned measures co-operate with one another in formulating joint recommendations.  In all cases, the Member States must consult the Advisory Councils, involving the fishing industry and other stakeholders, to hear and understand their concerns and consider any suggestions.  The possible measures cover technical and conservation measures to protect juvenile fish and vulnerable fish species and the roll out of the Discards ban over the period to 2019.  This is a big change as up to now decision making was fully centralised in Brussels and even decisions relating to technical issues required a lengthy decision making process involving the Commission, the Fisheries Council and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  We have already seen the tangible benefits of this regional policy with the development of regional plans for reducing and eliminating the wasteful practice of discards. Ireland is an active member of the North Western Waters Regional Group of Member States along with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.</p>  <p>  This group has, to date, succeeded in finding unanimous agreement on two separate plans to reduce discards that take real account of the interests of the relevant Member States and of the stakeholders through the role of the Advisory Councils. Regionalisation is not just about discard plans, however, and in the coming months and years a wide range of issues of direct relevance to Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities dependent upon fishing will be decided at regional level.</p></reply>

In February 2014 a new member with financial/accountancy expertise was appointed to the Board followed by the appointment in May 2014 of a new Board member with veterinary and legal expertise.  In terms of strengthening its organisation at executive level, Bord na gCon has expanded its risk management committee to include the Chief Executive Officer and all of the senior executive management team.

The identification of priority farmland bird areas on the GLAS system, including Hen Harrier, was informed by the expertise of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), who provided the most up-to-date datasets available.  The townlands of Ballincurrig and Ballyduff, while not formally notified to the European Commission as Special Protection Areas, were notified to my Department by the NPWS as areas which are also important for the bird.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that GLAS is a completely voluntary scheme and the payment rate for this farmland bird action, at &euro;370 per hectare, subject to a maximum payment of &euro;7,000, is designed to take account of the income foregone by the farmer in complying with the prescription outlined in the GLAS Specification. I have also indicated that I will consider an additional locally led Hen Harrier scheme to provide additional support for farmers with large areas of Hen Harrier habitat.   </p>  <p>  An assessment of Tranche 1 of GLAS will be carried out before Tranche 2 is opened in the Autumn.  This assessment will look at uptake of particular measures and any issues which have come to the fore.  There may be some adjustments to the Scheme arising from that review, but these will be designed to optimise the environmental benefit arising, taking account of the fact that the overall structure of GLAS has already been approved by the European Commission.</p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;.

The dramatic reduction in the prevalence of BSE from a peak of 333 cases in 2002 is proof of that.  The effectiveness of the system is further evidenced by the identification of the recent BSE case &ndash; and while it is disappointing to identify this isolated case now, it is not wholly unexpected that an occasional case of BSE could arise from time to time here or in other countries.</p>  <p>  The controls in place include a ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants, effective rendering processes, testing of feed supplies, active and passive surveillance, testing for the disease (including testing of all fallen animals over 48 months of age; and of animals over 30 months of age imported from countries specified in EU regulation &ndash; currently Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia), ante mortem checks on all animals prior to slaughter, and the removal and destruction, on a precautionary basis, of specified risk materials from slaughtered animals. </p>  <p>  The epidemiological investigation of the recent isolated case has confirmed inter alia that no concerns arise regarding the integrity of the commercial feed supply chain or the effectiveness of the feed control systems. In the 2009 and 2010 period, when the animal was born, more than 3,800 feed inspections took place, and almost 2,500 feed samples, including 52 from suppliers to the farm on which the positive case was found, were tested for the presence of processed animal proteins.  All tested negative for meat and bone meal. Test results from feed currently on the farm are also negative.</p>  <p>  A robust bovine traceability system is in place in Ireland which facilitates tracking of the provenance of any detected BSE case, progeny and contacts of same.  The robustness of the traceability measures operable in Ireland is evidenced by the ability to trace details pertaining to the most recent case, her progeny and cohorts. </p>  <p>  Laboratory facilities are also in place in Ireland to monitor BSE, including monitoring of animal feedingstuffs. Screening tests for TSE are done in accordance with EU Directive 999/2001.  Testing is only done in laboratories that have been approved by the Competent Authority on the recommendation of the National Reference Laboratory for TSE following a rigorous approval process. </p>  <p>  The OIE has stated that it very much respects the integrity and transparency demonstrated by Ireland in providing preliminary information on this recent case.  It further commends the commitment to the protection of animal and human health as demonstrated by the effectiveness of the ongoing BSE surveillance program and the controls in place that prevented any part of the animal from entering the human food or animal feed chain.</p>  <p>  We know that our reputation as a producer of safe sustainable beef is paramount and our regulatory and food safety systems are there to provide those assurances.

His report is accordingly received each year and is reviewed by my Department to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Code.  As the report provided by the Chairman contains confidential and commercially sensitive information, it would not be appropriate for me to provide copies of these reports, nor is it a requirement of the Code.  The Annual Report of the company is, however, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year and is available both in the Oireachtas Library and on the Company&rsquo;s website.

While actual product authorisation processes have been harmonised in the EU for nearly 30 years now, the harmonisation of the use of such products across the Member States is a relatively more recent development.</p>  <p>  The main regulations pertaining to &ldquo;Plant Protection Products&rdquo; (referred to as the pesticides package) have all undergone rigorous revision in the last 10 years, resulting in more uniformity across the EU, with enhanced levels of safety for both consumers and users alike.  The last number of years has seen the removal of over 600 active substances from the EU market (many of which are still used in 3rd countries) and safety profile of the remaining active substances has significantly improved.</p>  <p>  Included in this suite of regulations is Directive 2009/128/EC.  Broadly speaking this Directive, referred to as the &ldquo;Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive&rdquo;, establishes a framework for European Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides.  This is achieved by setting common standards to reduce the risks to human health and the environment that are associated with pesticide use.  This directive includes requirements for Member States to ensure that advisors, distributors and professional users of &ldquo;Plant Protection Products&rdquo; are trained to a minimum standard.  The directive also includes elements on the testing of &ldquo;pesticide application equipment&rdquo; and use restrictions around sensitive areas, as well as making the adoption of &ldquo;integrated pest management&rdquo; practices by farmers, mandatory.   </p>  <p>  Successful implementation of the Directive relies heavily on the level of training the various players in the sector are required to have.  Many individuals have already completed training that meets the requirements of the Direcctive.  My Department recognises the following courses as meeting the standard of training required for Professional Users under the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive:</p>  <p>  - FETAC 5N1797 &ndash; Boom Sprayer;</p>  <p>  - FETAC 5N0731 &ndash; Handheld Sprayer;</p>  <p>  - City &amp;amp; Guilds PA1 + PA2a &ndash; Boom Sprayer;</p>  <p>  - City &amp;amp; Guilds PA1 + PA6 &ndash; Handheld Sprayer.</p>  <p>  My Department also implements a comprehensive programme to control pesticide residues in food.  This programme is developed in consultation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the EU Commission and involves the analysis of some 1,500 samples of agricultural produce of plant and animal origin for residues of up to 400 pesticides and metabolites.  In the very small number of instances where excessive residues are found, appropriate follow-up action is taken.</p>  <p>  I am confident that an increase in training and education of all involved in the plant protection industry will have a very positive effect into the future.  As an economy heavily reliant on food exports, international image and public perception is everything.  An educated, adaptive and responsive crop sector has a role to play in the achievement of the goals established in &ldquo;Food Harvest 2020&rdquo; and as such, any initiative that enhances our global reputation for producing, pure and wholesome food products has to be welcomed.</p></reply>

The species is listed in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive, meaning that the bird is subject to special conservation measures which require, amongst other things, that Member States designate special protection areas (SPAs) for their conservation.  The designation of such lands is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who have designated the following areas:</p><p>- Slieve Bloom Mountains SPA - <i>(Laois and Offaly);</i></p><p>- Stacks to Mullaghareirk Mountains, West Limerick Hills and Mount Eagle SPA -<i>(Cork, Kerry and Limerick</i>);</p><p>- Boggerahs (Mullaghanish/Musheramore Mountains) SPA - <i>(</i>Cork<i>)</i>; </p><p>- Slievefelim to Silvermines SPA - <i>(Limerick and Tipperary)</i>;</p><p>- Slieve Beagh SPA - <i>(Monaghan);</i></p><p>- Slieve Aughty Mountains SPA - <i>(Clare and Galway).</i></p><p>No funds have been specifically allocated by the European Union to compensate farmers for designation, but under my Department&rsquo;s new agri-environment scheme GLAS, which is co-funded by the EU, actions to preserve hen-harrier habitat are explicitly included and were agreed with the EU.  Information available to my Department suggests that a <b>total of 4,000 farmers have some designated lands </b>and I envisage that GLAS will be the main source of support under my Department for such farmers. <b>With this in mind, I have made possession of </b>Hen Harrier land a Tier One Priority Environmental Asset under GLAS, guaranteeing that any farmer with an identified habitat will secure priority access to the scheme. </p><p>The payment rate for Hen Harrier is &euro;370 per hectare.  This payment applies to all lands notified to my Department by the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service as Hen Harrier Lands, whether these are formally designated or otherwise identified as important for the preservation of the bird.  Under the Birds Directive, Ireland is obliged to protect the Hen Harrier wherever it occurs and for this reason I was anxious to ensure that farmers could be properly supported for additional effort and income foregone, and that this would not be restricted to designated Natura sites.  In addition, I have provided that farmers with Hen Harrier habitat will automatically qualify for GLAS Plus, offering an increased payment of up to &euro;7,000 per annum provided they manage sufficient area of habitat.</p></reply>

This demonstrates a significant interest in the Programme and is consistent with the numbers that participated in the Beef Data Programmes of 2013 and 2014 and the Beef Genomics Scheme 2014.  Officials in my Department are currently finalising the initial validation of all applications received and I expect that approval letters will shortly issue to all eligible applicants.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware I have taken a number of positive steps to help to improve profitability on Irish suckler farms in a sustainable way and I believe that this scheme provides a unique opportunity to build on this.  It will provide a much needed boost to the sector and involves funding of over &euro;300 million over the 6 years of the programme.  The BDGP is co-funded by the EU and is designed in such a way to ensure that it makes a positive contribution to farmer profitability while at the same time reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s beef production. In general higher genetic merit heifers will be more fertile, will calve younger, more easily, and at shorter intervals, and will reduce the costs associated with the production of weanlings.  This scheme will help participants to identify the highest genetic merit replacement heifers.  My priority is to ensure that participants attain the maximum benefit from participation in this programme.</p>  <p>  To be eligible for payment in this first year of the Programme participants must provide the required survey data, genotype all of the specified animals and send test samples to the laboratory.  Data can be provided when calves are five months old so it will be possible that all of these requirements can be met by some herds who had completed all of their 2015 calving by the end of June thereby facilitating payment in December.  As the Deputy is aware, further payments will continue to be made as herds meet the Programme requirements.</p></reply>

The protections, such as the muzzling of greyhounds, which were introduced in 1993 have played an important role in safeguarding hares involved in coursing.  In addition to supervision by officers from the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, my Department&rsquo;s veterinary officials attend around 10% of coursing meetings with a view to ensuring optimum welfare standards.  These are selected through a combination of random and risk-based decision making.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the matter was both debated at length and voted upon during the extensive debates that occurred during the passage of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 through these houses.  I think that we have struck a reasonable balance in the legislation as between those opposed to hare coursing and those who consider it to be a legitimate sport.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 applies across the board, both to rural and urban areas and to all animals, irrespective of species, whether kept for commercial, domestic, sport, show or for other purposes.  Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person can receive a fine of up to &euro; 5 ,000 and, on indictment, &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years.  There are fixed penalty payments for lesser offenses.  The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 is working well and I have no plans to review so soon after it has come into effect.</p></reply>

I am also delighted to see the range of actions which have been selected. In fact, actions addressing every single objective set out under GLAS have been selected by farmers in this first tranche, including commonages. GLAS is clearly going to play a key role in the protection of our rural environment over the new programming period.</p>  <p>  I would also like acknowledge the number of commonages which have come into GLAS in this first tranche. Applications in respect of almost 2,700 commonages, or well over half of all the commonages in the country, have been received. This is a major step towards the establishment of greatly enhanced management regimes for these upland areas. In all, some 4,000 commonage farmers have applied to join GLAS, with a similar number already managing commonages under AEOS. These AEOS commonage farmers are only likely to join GLAS when their AEOS contracts expire and I have made specific provision to accommodate these applications in due course. </p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the challenge of preparing so many commonage management plans. This is a new approach, which seeks the proactive engagement of as many commonage shareholders as possible. My Department continues to review the preparation of these plans in consultation with the commonage advisors and has also discussed the issue with farming representatives. It is important that these plans are done to a high standard and I will give as much support as possible in this regard.</p></reply>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year.</p>  <p>  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.6 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances.  The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. </p>  <p>  My Department continuously reviews the inspection process to take account of changes in the governing regulations and also to reflect comments and findings contained in the various audit reports.  Inspecting officers in my Department are regularly trained in inspection procedures, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification inspections to ensure a consistent approach.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Inspection Unit participates fully at various meetings and workshops organised by the European Commission, where Commission experts and experts from other EU member states share their knowledge.  In this way the Inspection Unit has and continues to build up extensive corporate knowledge on inspection requirements.  This ensures that the EU regulatory requirements are being fully met and also that the training of the inspecting officers on inspection procedures is kept up-to-date.   </p>  <p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is also in place in order to protect the interests of famers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements.  This appeal system incorporates the option for a farmer to initially seek to have the inspection outcome reviewed internally by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer.  Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Essentially, financial instruments offer an alternative to the traditional grant based approach whereby schemes under the RDP may be funded via loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on our existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding. It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources such as the European Investment Bank.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has indicated that it is aiming to double the usage of these financial instruments in the 2014-2020 programming period.  Officials in my Department have been engaging with the European Commission, EIB and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect.  They are also   exploring the practical steps which are required in order to implement financial instruments and put in place a clear plan based on real market failures and economic needs.</p>  <p>  In addition to exploring the possibility of implementing financial instruments via the RDP, my Department has been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements.  The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market.  The European Investment Bank is one of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding partners, and this new product is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p></reply>

It has to be acknowledged that there are difficult geopolitical tensions at play here, and that a negative impact on the EU&rsquo;s agri-food sector is an unfortunate consequence.  There is a clear need for an EU-wide response and the Commission&rsquo;s market support measures to date are welcome and remain a key part of the solution for EU producers.</p>  <p>  Irish agri-food exports to Russia declined from &euro;213 million in 2013 to &euro;145 million in 2014. Some of this reduction was accounted for by a ban on EU pigmeat imports which came into effect in January 2014, before the Presidential ban on most EU food imports came into effect in August. Exports will obviously be much lower this year as the ban will be in place for the full year, with dairy, fish and pigmeat being the main sectors affected. For the first four months of 2015, agri-food exports to Russia amounted to &euro;15.3 million, an 80% reduction on the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to continuing to work in partnership with the Russian and EU authorities to help to resolve these issues in any way we can. I have met with the Russian Ambassador to Ireland and there have been two high-level meetings between my Department and the Russian authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with industry to source new and alternative markets internationally for Irish food and the announcements by the US and China on Irish beef earlier this year are proof of the success of these efforts.  Agri-food exports to all non-EU markets grew to a record &euro;3.1 billion in 2014, an increase of 15% over 2013, with particularly strong growth in exports to Asia (+36%) and the Gulf States (+39%).  These new markets, with growing middle class populations and high disposable incomes, will provide significant growth opportunities for Ireland&rsquo;s dairy, meat and seafood sectors.</p></reply>

Ireland, which did not have a track record of fishing for bluefin tuna, does not have a quota.</p><p>My Department has made enquiries with the EU Commission and the unequivocal advice we have received is that a recreational fishery for bluefin tuna is not legally possible in the absence of a national bluefin tuna quota.  We do not have such a quota and it is extremely unlikely that we could obtain one as it would involve reducing the share of the Total Allowable Catch of those EU Member States that do have quota and for whom bluefin is an important commercial fishery. </p><p>Ireland cannot make an application directly to ICCAT as it is the EU and not individual Member States which are members of that body.  Norway, obviously, is not a member of the EU and so it can make its case directly to ICCAT. </p><p>A tag and release programme that would not impact on mortality and would contribute to the overall scientific knowledge of this species is an option that may be possible.  A case would have to be made in the first instance at EU level and only if successful there could it be pursued at EU level with ICCAT. </p><p>Careful consideration needs to be given to how a case can be put together to reassure our EU colleagues that there would not be any negative impact on the stock.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, which has responsibility for angling, is currently examining a proposal from the Irish Big Game Angling Association and I expect to receive its response shortly. </p><p>My Department will continue to liaise closely with DCENR and relevant stakeholders on this matter to consider who would be in a position to undertake the detailed work required to prepare a case on how a possible tag and release scheme might work in practice.  This case will need to cover issues such as the possible scope of the scheme in terms of seasons and numbers, how fish are handled etc.  As soon as the response of DCENR is received, I will be better placed to determine if the proposal of the Irish Big Game Angling Association or an amended or alternative proposal can be progressed.</p></reply>

It is not something that the Minister for Agriculture can directly influence.  I am of course monitoring market developments closely and liaising on a regular basis with farm organisations, other EU Member States and the processing sector.</p>  <p>  After two years of very strong prices, markets have taken a n unwelcome downward turn in recent times.  The average farm gate milk price including VAT currently stands in the region of 30-31 cents per litre, significantly lower than the same period last year.  The price situation in Ireland is broadly replicated in other EU MS, reflecting the global nature of this problem.  Using cross country comparable data from the EU Milk Market Observatory the most recently available complete data shows that the milk price in Ireland is approximately 22% below the same month in 2014, slightly above the 18% decrease on average across the EU. </p>  <p>  Strong production in milk producing countries, high levels of stocks, including in China and the Russian ban which has recently been extended have all had an impact.  However, while there has been a succession of negative results from the Global Dairy Trade auction, the trend has not been wholly negative, with the most recent auction showing positive results for butter, buttermilk powder, cheddar and casein. </p>  <p>  Overall, I remain confident about the medium to longer term prospects for the sector, with growing global demand expected to support prices in the years ahead.  It is clear, however, that there will be continuing volatility, both upward and downward, around this positive trend. </p>  <p>  My focus now is ensuring that the correct balance of policies and supports are in place so that the Irish dairy sector can overcome the effects of volatility over the next while. For my part:</p>  <p> - I will continue to push hard at EU level for deployment and extension of EU market supports where appropriate. Intervention and APS are at present available for butter and SMP;</p>  <p> - I have also introduced a number of agri-taxation measures in last year&rsquo;s budget, including extending the income averaging to five years, and this will be of great assistance to dairy farmers   wishing to manage volatility;</p>  <p> - I recently introduced a scheme to facilitate the repayment of the superlevy bill by farmers over three years which I expect will be heavily subscribed;</p>  <p> - I have introduced a number of schemes under the RDP which will assist dairy farmers in years to come including a new &euro;50m investment just this week for capital investments on farm;</p>  <p> - I am continuing to press Irish banks to ensure that access to credit for our dairy sector is available, competitive but also responsive to market volatility.</p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage suppliers and processors to examine their own relationships to determine whether a greater proportion of milk can by put into fixed price contracts.</p>  <p>  I believe that a combination of these measures allied to the investment and expertise of our dairy farmers and processors means that the Irish dairy sector remains well placed to realise its potential in the years to come and to meet the challenges of market volatility long the way.</p></reply>

This system provides for effective and dissuasive measures, including suspension from testing, where veterinary practitioners fail to comply with their contractual obligations.  It also includes an appeals process in respect of any sanctions imposed. My Department attaches very considerable importance to the implementation of an effective TB testing regime in view of the cost of the programme to the national exchequer, the need to eradicate this disease, the value of the beef industry to Ireland and the reliance placed on veterinary certification under the TB programme to support the industry.</p>  <p>  The Veterinary Practitioner involved has been suspended from the list of Veterinary Practitioners approved to conduct tuberculin testing as a consequence of evidence found by the Veterinary Inspectorate in my Department of repeated failure on behalf of this Practitioner to comply with EU and national legislation and to adhere to the terms and conditions of the Conditions and Instructions for Veterinary Practitioners involved in testing and sampling under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication and Brucellosis monitoring programmes.  The breaches detected compromised the validity of a number of TB tests.  The practitioner, together with his legal representatives, has attended a number of meetings and has had follow-up written correspondence with officers of my Department. </p>  <p>  The Veterinary Practitioner involved has been informed of his right to appeal the decision to suspend him from testing.  The appeals process, which has been agreed with Veterinary Ireland, the representative organisation for private veterinary practitioners, involves consideration by senior veterinary and administrative officials at my Department&rsquo;s head office of any evidence he wishes to advance, in writing, in his defence.  The appeal may be conducted entirely in writing or orally at the request of the appellant.

In addition, he has access to the courts if, following consideration of this appeal, he considers that he is being treated unjustly.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the manner in which the case has been investigated.

Planning for the post quota period had been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence.  Notwithstanding the overriding opportunity that a quota free environment will bring I remain acutely aware that addressing price volatility will be a key challenge for the dairy sector and in particular for farmers.</p>  <p>  All stakeholders in the sector need to be cognisant of the reality that there will be occasions, as there have been in recent years, where various factors align to provide the sector with a positive market context.  There will be other times, such as the current environment, when issues such as global supply imbalances impact on prices in EU and domestic markets.  Those involved in the dairy sector, including banks, cooperatives, farmers and Government, need to work together to mitigate the impact of these peaks and troughs.</p>  <p>  The market supports framework negotiated as part of the reformed CAP will continue to play a role, and as Minister I will be proactive in demanding their deployment on extension when circumstances require it.  The new CAP regulations provide for more flexible exceptional measures in times of difficulty, but we must remain aware that resources in this respect will not be unlimited.</p>  <p>  A key insulation against volatility is the ongoing move up the value chain that is in evidence in Irish dairy production.  The almost &euro;1 billion investment by Ireland&rsquo;s processing industry in preparation for quota abolition will be key to realising this potential and is one of the reasons why we can be confident about the long term future of the sector here. Investment in innovation and product development in areas such as food for the aged and for infants, sports nutrition and food for health can help to produce a higher value product mix which is less susceptible to volatility.  Furthermore, it remains clearly evident, from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products that the sustainability message for our production has a strong resonance, and through the Origin Green Programme and the Dairy Quality Assurance Scheme, we are building a brand image for Irish milk production based on our strong environmental credentials.</p>  <p>  Another key issue in addressing the issue is in respect of efficiency gains at farm level, which can help to mitigate the downside impact of price volatility.  The State has also provided financial support for knowledge transfer groups, breed improvement, through ICBF, and for research, advice and education, through Teagasc.  With the Dairy Quality and Sustainability Scheme, and the Origin Green Initiative, Bord Bia is helping to drive a sustainability culture that is already serving the Irish dairy sector well on international markets.  Actions to improve environmental sustainability also improve the bottom line for farmers.</p>  <p>  In terms of relationships along the domestic supply chain, it is important that the scope for longer term fixed price supply contracts for a proportion of farmers&rsquo; production are examined and utilised where appropriate.  This is a feature of the market that is developing slowly and which I would encourage. Longer term supply arrangements with the buyers of Irish raw materials and ingredients may also be of benefit in this respect. It is also important that bank facilities are calibrated to deal with the impact of volatility on farmer returns.</p>  <p>  The Single Farm Payment also provides an income buffer in terms of volatility mitigation and taxation is also a key policy instrument in respect of dealing with the issue, where the increase from 3 to 5 years for the purposes of Income averaging represents a key measure which can only be positive for dairy farmers and for the sector in general. Dairy futures markets are also a slowly emerging feature in Europe.</p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong.  I am confident that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand whilst simultaneously addressing these challenges of volatility.</p></reply>

Were Ireland to ban mink farming, it would have little impact on the scale of the practice internationally generally.  It would have significant consequences, however, for the operators themselves who are based in rural areas where the employment they provide would in the current economic circumstances be difficult to replace. </p><p>I also noted the small scale of the sector in Ireland; two former operators ceased to trade in the past three years and no applications have been received to establish new mink-keeping enterprises which currently means that Ireland has only three operators licensed. </p><p>My Department has statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of farmed animals under the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations, 2010 (Statutory Instrument No 311/2010) and the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

The Review Group recommended that more rigorous standards be imposed on the industry in the areas of animal welfare, accommodation and nutrient management. </p><p>In the light of all of the foregoing, I decided to endorse the recommendations of the Group.

However, this is not possible as, while the Department mapping systems are underpinned by ortho-photography, a comparison cannot be made between its datasets and the trees and forests depicted on Google Earth.  The Department mapping datasets contain <i>defined boundary information</i>in respect of all forests; they do not contain information on hedgerows or individual trees (including those in scrubland). Google Earth however has no boundaries recorded in respect of forests, or information on hedgerows or scrubland; it has no measured data against which Department data can be compared.</p><p>However, the Department is responsible for issuing tree felling licences and, thus, for policy on deforestation.  In this respect, it must take into account the environment, landscape, sustainable forest management, and all relevant legislation.  Apart from normal forestry operations, with certain exceptions, a licence is also required to fell trees in natural woodlands, trees situated in scrubland, or individual trees.</p><p>In order to protect woodlands, promote sustainable forest management, avoid excessive carbon credit costs, and protect the substantial State investment in afforestation programmes, the Department has a well-established policy of requiring replanting after felling.  Where the landowner does not wish to replant the area felled, he may afforest an alternative site.  Any project that is for commercial gain is required to replant the site or to afforest an alternative location (e.g. housing development, farming, industrial, wind farm, etc.). </p><p>The recently launched &euro;262 million Forestry Programme 2014-2020 aims to facilitate the planting of almost 44,000 hectares of new forests.  It incorporates Agro-Forestry, Native Woodland Establishment and Woodland Improvement Schemes, a NeighbourWood Scheme, and a Native Woodland Conservation Scheme.  The aim of the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme is to support the protection and enhancement of existing native woodland, primarily to protect and enhance native woodland ecosystems. It is focused on restorative management of existing native woodlands.  A strong priority will be placed on important native woodland types and opportunities for habitat linkage, and on environmentally sensitive areas, with a view to realising wider ecosystems services such as water protection.</p><p>Given the safeguards that the current legislation and policy provide, and the commitment provided by the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, I am confident that my Department is in a position to protect the landscape, environment and national forest estate, while meeting the demands of successfully developing the Agriculture Sector through the various schemes and reports such as Food Harvest 2020.</p></reply>

I strongly believe that progress to date can only be viewed as very positive, with the added bonus of a huge latent potential remaining to be developed on an ongoing basis, as we increase production following quota abolition.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Agriculture, I have headed two trade missions to China, with dairy market development a significant feature in both. Ireland&rsquo;s dairy offering resonates with Chinese consumers who place safety, traceability and sustainability at the core of their value proposition.  The Chinese authorities undertook a detailed inspection visit of our food safety systems and plants in 2014 and Irish dairy plants received a 100% approval rating which we believe to be the highest success rate of any of our competitor countries around the world.  As part of my last mission to China in November 2014 I also hosted a highly successful dairy seminar attended by key Chinese buyers and media. </p>  <p>  Recently, Chinese buying on platforms such as the Global Dairy Trade auction has slackened somewhat with Chinese stocks of dairy produce reportedly filled to required domestic levels.  Obviously this will have impacts globally on the dairy trade given the volume of product which China buys annually.  The slowing of the Chinese market has coincided with increased milk output in the main production areas of Europe, New Zealand and the US which have provided a combination of factors contributing to a softening of the market.  There is also the announcement last week by the Russian authorities of the extension of their ban on food products of the EU which, while not unexpected, is clearly not good news for a market already under pressure.   </p>  <p>  The Irish Dairy sector has made extraordinary strides in China in recent years.  Ireland has an evolving focus towards, and nonetheless competes at, the higher value end of the Chinese dairy market.  In the infant formula sector, Irish based products are viewed as super-premium brands.  China is now Ireland&rsquo;s second largest export market for dairy produce, compared to 13th in 2008.  In total, companies based in Ireland exported almost &euro;400m worth of dairy produce to China in 2014.  This is an increase from just &euro;104m in 2010 and highlights the huge rate of growth in our dairy exports there in a short space of time.  More recently, in the 3 month period to the end of March of this year, dairy product exports to China from Ireland were up over 50% on the same period in 2014, with infant formula the key driver. </p>  <p>  Recently, Chinese buying on platforms such as the Global Dairy Trade auction has slackened somewhat with Chinese stocks of dairy produce reportedly filled to required domestic levels.

There is also the announcement last week by the Russian authorities of the extension of their ban on food products of the EU which, while not unexpected, is clearly not good news for a market already under pressure.   </p>  <p>  My focus now is on expanding even further the growth rates which Irish dairy has achieved in China to date and this involves working closely with Bord Bia and industry to build on recent successes, not just in China but in all of the 170 countries around the worked in which Irish dairy produce is sold.  In this regard I plan to lead trade missions to China and West Africa, before the end of this year, which as always will seek to find new business opportunities for Irish dairy products.  </p></reply>

The new Common Fisheries Policy, negotiated to conclusion during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in 2013, provides for a practical and phased discards policy, or landing obligation. </p><p>The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1 January 2015.  The landing obligation will be extended to certain whitefish species from the 1 January 2016 and will be fully phased in by the 1 January 2019.</p><p>The phasing-in period gives fishermen time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of unwanted catches. </p><p>The pelagic discard plan, which came into effect this year, was developed through the regional decision-making process introduced by the new CFP.  Ireland worked with fellow Member States in the North Western Waters Group (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) on finalising the plan.  The Group also worked closely with the Pelagic Advisory Council, involving stakeholders.</p><p>The preparation of the Discard Plan for whitefish species was carried out during the period of Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship of the North Western Waters Group (January to June 2015).  The Member States worked closely with the North Western Waters Advisory Council, representatives of which attended each meeting of the North Western Waters Member States Group since Ireland assumed the Chair.</p><p>The ban on discarding, which covers all of the waters around Ireland and the Channel, will apply to the prawn (nephrops) fishery in all waters, the whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea and the haddock fishery in the Irish Sea and in the North West area from the 1 January 2016.  The landing obligation will be rolled out to other fisheries in the years leading up to 2019, when it will apply to all stocks.</p><p>The Irish industry has been kept fully informed throughout this process through the Discards Implementation Group, chaired by Dr. Noel Cawley.  I established this Group to allow the Irish fishing industry to be fully prepared for, and engaged in, the implementation of the discards ban.  Agreement on the discard plan for 2016 provides the Discards Implementation Group with a clear blueprint to help prepare the industry for the forthcoming changes.</p><p><i>I am providing funding support to the fishing industry through the new EU Fisheries Operational Programme, which I am currently progressing, for the effective delivery of the new measures.  I have made &euro;450,000 available in 2015 to BIM and the MI to undertake</i><b><i></i></b><i>a project over the summer period, exploring the potential impact of the landing obligation on commercial fishing activity.  This project will follow up on the discard simulation trials conducted last autumn.</i></p></reply>

In doing so they have committed to actions and farming prescriptions which are expected to deliver substantial environmental benefits in the years ahead.  These actions will improve and maintain our water quality, will encourage biodiversity and the maintenance of valuable habitats, while also promoting climate change mitigation.  These farmers are the custodians of our farmed landscape and in joining GLAS they are continuing the important conservation work which has already been carried out in previous agri-environment schemes.</p>  <p>  The management of our uplands by means of commonage management plans is given the highest priority in GLAS and I welcome the fact 3,934 applications in respect of just under 2,700 commonages, or well over half of all commonages in the country, have been received.  This represents 30% of all commonage farmers and is a major step towards the establishment of greatly enhanced management regimes for these upland areas.  A similar number of commonage farmers are already managing their commonage lands through AEOS and intend to see out their contracts, confident in the knowledge that they will receive priority access to GLAS when they do decide to join.  Others may have waited in order to see if a commonage management plan is commenced on their particular commonage.  This option was open to farmers, given that commonage management plans can be joined at a later date and that priority access remains open to these farmers.     </p>  <p>  While it is clear, therefore, that there are commonage farmers who have not yet applied for the Scheme I am very optimistic that the numbers will increase in due course.  A phased recruitment to both GLAS and to the various Commonage Management Plans was specifically anticipated in the scheme design, and specific provision has been made to accommodate these farmers on that basis.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone.  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. </p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  </p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend toward electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms and I am aware of concerns that have been raised in regard to some of the amended forms.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office.  This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers. In order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally, I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.</p>  <p>  These amendments will be carried out over the next number of weeks. My officials have already commenced preparatory work on this process and I expect this work to be completed in a timely manner.  However, given that the department&rsquo;s forms are integrated into its automated systems the work must be done carefully and properly to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers. I do not wish to cause delays to our customers through loss of our automated systems due to improperly considered changes or modifications.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.131.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100078#WRC02000"><p>Expenditure on the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) scheme is estimated to be &euro;607 million in 2015 with almost 70,000 recipients. </p>  <p>  However, despite committing extensive funding to lone parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain the most at-risk-of-poverty, and their children are at a high risk of poverty.  For too long, significant numbers of lone parents have been typecast, and confined to social welfare dependency. The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment. The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.  </p>  <p>  In 2004, in the height of the economic boom, lone parents were more than 4 and a half times at risk of consistent poverty (their at risk of consistent poverty rate was 30%) when compared with the population as a whole.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, lone parents are 2 and a half times more at risk of consistent poverty (their at risk of consistent poverty rate was 23%) compared to the rest of the population.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, compared to those who do not.</p>  <p>  The reforms seek to address the long-term social welfare dependency and poverty experienced by many lone parents by providing them with improved access to the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment supports, such as back to education allowance, back to work enterprise allowance, community employment and the recently introduced back to work family dividend (worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year and &euro;775 per child in the second year).  </p>  <p>  Access to these services and supports is imperative for lone parents, in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved. </p>  <p>  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future.  I therefore have no plans to reverse the forthcoming changes to the one parent family payment. </p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports that are available to all families with children, including one-parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit payment as well as in other supports for families that are engaged in both full-time and part-time employment.</p>  <p>  The reforms to the one-parent family payment have highlighted the need for child care supports to be available for lone parents who make the transition into employment.  On that basis I have introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  This payment allows lone parents whose youngest child is aged 7-13 years to balance their caring responsibilities by exempting them from having to be available for and genuinely seeking full time employment.</p>  <p>  The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, also introduced the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Both of these schemes were funded by the Department from savings from the child benefit scheme and build on the 25,000 subsidised child care places that are provided to low-income parents by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs every year. </p>  <p>  In relation to providing extra support for transitioning lone parents who live in rural areas and who are availing of education, the main source of student support nationwide is the SUSI grant &ndash; which is provided by the Department of Education and Skills and is available to lone parents on OFP and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  Included in the grant&rsquo;s qualifying conditions is a clause that determines the level of income support that should be provided to a student in accordance with the distance that they live from their college.</p></reply>

These rates generally rise substantially in the second year of apprenticeship.  The most recent statistics show that there are some 38,200 persons aged 25 or younger on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  While the full weekly rate of jobseekers&rsquo;&rsquo; allowance is &euro;188, approximately 31,000 of these young claimants are in receipt of a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance of either &euro;144 or &euro;100 per week.  In the light of the above I am not aware of any significant disincentives facing young people considering coming off Jobseekers&rsquo; Allowance to take up apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were introduced in 2009 and these measures were extended in Budget 2010.  Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients aged 25 years of age.  This is a targeted activation measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities as those who avail of such opportunities are well placed to take full advantage of sustainable employment.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p>  <p>  The measures did not apply to existing claimants on a higher rate at the time the initiative was introduced or to young jobseeker allowance recipients with children.</p></reply>

Most claimants of social welfare schemes, where required, fully declare their income and assets and do not receive more than their due entitlements.  Where a claimant fails to fully declare their means, they may receive a payment, or a rate of payment, to which they are not entitled which can result in an overpayment being assessed against them.</p>  <p>  While it is the Department&rsquo;s aim to prevent overpayments, where they occur they are a debt to the Exchequer, and every effort is made to recover the full amount due.  Accordingly, a repayment settlement of less than the overpayment amount cannot be considered in the case of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides for deductions of up to fifteen per cent of a person&rsquo;s personal rate of social welfare payment to be taken towards the recovery of an overpayment, without the debtor&rsquo;s consent.  This measure has been applied in the case of the person concerned.  If the person concerned is experiencing financial hardship as a result of the deductions applied, it is open to them to seek to have the rate of debt recovery reviewed on financial hardship grounds.  A Recovery Officer will require detailed statements of all income sources for the past three months, details of all accounts held in any financial institution(s), together with any other relevant documentation or information in order to consider whether or not a case of financial hardship can be made.  If the person concerned wishes to request such a review, they should submit their supporting documentation directly to Debt Management Unit, Department of Social Protection, College Road, Sligo.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the person concerned is in receipt of a reduced rate state pension (contributory) based on their social insurance record.  It is open to the person concerned to make an application for state pension (non-contributory), which is subject to a household means-test and may yield a higher weekly rate of payment.  An application form for state pension (non-contributory) has been issued to the person concerned.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year.  There are well-documented reasons why many individuals are not investing or not investing sufficiently in pension saving. I do not believe the pension fund levies to be a principal reason among these.</p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.</p>  <p>  The pension fund stamp duty levies are charged on the trustees of pension schemes and others (including insurance companies) who have responsibility for the management of the assets of pension schemes or plans.  It is up to the trustees of pension schemes, for example, to decide whether and how the impact of the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent.  I have no detailed information on the decisions made by pension fund trustees or others in relation to the passing on of the full or a partial impact of the levy to the current, deferred or former (retired) members of pension schemes.  I am aware, however, that where trustees have made the decision to pass on the impact or part of the impact of the levy to pensioners that a smaller reduction in pension payments over the lifetime of the pension may have been made in many cases in preference to a larger reduction over a shorter period.</p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as may be implied in the questions.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.</p>  <p>  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on those on low and middle incomes.</p>  <p>  As regards serving and retired public servants, I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that the application of the pension-related deduction (PRD) to serving public servants resulted in an average reduction of some 7% in the remuneration of public servants (from March 2009) and was followed by a further reduction of 6% from 1 January 2010 in the remuneration rates applicable to public servants.  A third pay reduction applied to public servants earning in excess of &euro;65,000 with effect from 1 July 2013 at rates ranging from 5.5% to 10%.  The public service pension reduction (PSPR) imposed reductions from 1 January 2011 on public service pensions in payment in excess of &euro;12,000 per annum using a progressively tiered set of bands and rates.  The measure, as introduced, resulted in an average reduction of 4% to public service pensions with much higher reductions for those on higher pensions.  Further reductions for higher public service pensions were introduced in July 2013.</p>  <p>  While changes to the PRD and PSPR are proposed to start from next year which will result in reductions in the PRD and the PSPR, particularly affecting public servants on low and middle incomes and retired public servants in receipt of low pensions, there is no provision for the repayment of PRD or PSPR already deducted from the remuneration or pensions of the affected individuals.</p></reply>

The scheme came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015. The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. In Budget 2015 I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax. </p><p>Qualifying works are works which are subject to the 13.5% VAT rate. These works must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) which will attract a tax credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT), a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out. There is no VAT relief under this scheme.</p><p>Data relating to the Home Renovation Incentive is available from the statistics section of the Revenue website at . In particular, the data which the Deputy seeks is available in the Tax Expenditures section of the page at .</p><p>It should be noted that the value of the tax credits referred to therein is not reflective of the cost to the Exchequer as not all credits have been claimed to date. Furthermore, it should be noted that tax credits claimed by an individual are split evenly over a two year period.</p></reply>

Underlying this framework is the Financing for Development process which seeks to reach an agreement, later this year, among the participating countries on a financing package to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals. These discussions and processes are taking place at UN level and Ireland is an active participant along with other Member States. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy referred to in his Question, the next phase of these discussions is the Financing for Development Summit in Addis Ababa in mid-July which will adopt the agreed final outcome of the negotiations. Ireland will be represented at this Summit by a delegation led by my colleague Mr Sean Sherlock T.D., Minister of State for Development, and comprising officials from the relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and my Department, reflecting the whole-of-Government approach to Ireland's development aid policy. I am pleased that civil society will also be represented on our delegation. The focus of these discussions is on developing channels of finance which are new and innovative, reflecting the shift away from traditional Overseas Development Aid (ODA) as the main source of development finance, and include: leveraging private finance as a catalyst for growth, the development of the private sector and business environment in developing countries, and strengthening the domestic resource mobilisation of developing countries.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's engagement in the post-2015 development agenda and the Financing for Development process has been guided by strong inter-Departmental coordination, co-chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. My Department participates actively in this interdepartmental coordination mechanism while primary responsibility for Ireland's development aid policy lies with the Minister of State for Development and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  My Department welcomes these broad-ranging and open discussions by developing and developed countries with a view to considering various options and sources for scaling-up development finance to support developing countries sustainably and in the best interests of global sustainable development.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the Summit in Addis Ababa will be important for the progress of the overall discussions on the post-2015 Development agenda and Financing for Development process. Ireland will be actively engaged in these discussions and will consider the implications for the broader development agenda while the joined-up approach to the discussions will help to ensure that the outcomes achieved will be in line with Ireland's development aid policy and in accordance with the priority of sustainability.</p></reply>

These set down rules whereby contracting authorities must award contracts under procedures designed to achieve value for public money in an open, transparent and non discriminatory competitive process. Contracting authorities are precluded from awarding contracts to a company simply on the basis of geographical location.</p>  <p>  There is no specific study completed by my Department on the impact on local economies of the centralisation of procurement, currently carried out by local authorities.  Instead the Office of Government Procurement has established Category Councils to develop category-specific strategies that seek to establish the best commercial approach to the supply market that balances the need to achieve value for the money for the State with other objectives such as supply market sustainability, and other Government Policy objectives. The content of these strategies will vary depending upon the nature of the goods and services required.  The frameworks the OGP is putting in place typically breakdown customer requirements by lots against which suppliers can bid.  Lots may be based on goods or services descriptions, usage patterns, size and nature of customer demand and/or geographical location.  The lotting arrangements are determined by the sourcing strategy and consider customer requirements and market supply factors.  </p>  <p>  The recently published report by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) "Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013" showed that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland. This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion expenditure across 64 large public service bodies involving over 35,000 suppliers. The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

These options were identified under the East Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (ECFRAM) study, and on which the public were consulted in 2013.  The proposals for flood mitigation measures on the River Poddle also involve some downstream defence works.  The works at Tymon Park are likely be progressed first.  </p>  <p>  South Dublin County Council (SDCC) is taking the proposals forward through planning and eventual construction.  The Council is now in the process of procuring the design consultants for the Scheme.  Once consultants have been appointed, a comprehensive programme to take the Scheme through planning and construction will be developed by the Council.  The consultants will also prepare a detailed Cost Benefit Analysis for the proposed works.</p>  <p>  Subject to successful completion of the planning process and the continued availability of funding, it is hoped to be in a position to commence construction of the main scheme works in 2017.  The possibility of carrying out the Tymon Park attenuation works in advance of the main scheme works, perhaps using OPW direct labour, will be considered. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has given a commitment in principle to funding a viable, cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable scheme for the Poddle and has made indicative provision for its cost in its Multi-Annual Capital Budget Profiles.  The construction of the scheme is expected take two years.</p>  <p>  The works proposed to alleviate flooding on the Poddle are to be designed to the standard level of protection often referred to as the 100-year flood, which is to prevent flooding during events with a 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) for fluvial floods.  The design will take account also of climate change. </p>  <p>  The OPW understands that the interim works carried out so far by South Dublin County Council have significantly alleviated flood risk in the area but it is not possible to state to what level of flood risk these works provide protection.  New screens have been placed on the Poddle, with regular cleaning of these screens being undertaken by the Council.</p>  <p>  In relation to insurance, when the works on the Poddle are completed, the OPW will provide full details of these and the level of protection they provide to the insurance industry in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the OPW and Insurance Ireland.  It will be a matter for the insurance companies to take this information into account in deciding on the provision of flood risk cover for affected properties.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.283.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100084#WRJ00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 to 105, inclusive, together.  </p>  <p>  I share the Deputies&rsquo; concern in relation to the recent developments at Liberty Insurance, where job losses were announced last week.  The most significant area of concern in this jurisdiction is the proposed reduction of 115 jobs in Cavan town, which will be a significant blow to those employees and their families in this rural area.</p>  <p>  This decision was made after a strategic internal review by the company.  The Deputies will appreciate that we cannot change a company decision - companies make strategic decisions based on what they think is best for the company and its owners.  In the globalised world we live in, capital is very mobile.  We are generally very successful in retaining and embedding foreign companies in Ireland, unfortunately in this case the company have made a decision to reduce numbers.  So the priority now is to retain the remaining jobs and work to create new jobs elsewhere.  </p>  <p>  The underlying reason for these redundancies is that Liberty Insurance conducted a strategic review of its business and that it will, as a result, withdraw from the personal motor insurance market in Great Britain and make significant changes to its operations in Ireland.  The company will now focus on the Republic of Ireland market.</p>  <p>  On a more positive note, Liberty Insurance has purchased the remaining minority stake in the company.  In addition it has announced the acquisition of a company in Northern Ireland and has continued to invest and create jobs in their Liberty IT division in both Dublin and Belfast.  In 2013 the company announced the creation of 150 jobs in an IT project at their Blanchardstown operation and this project is being put in place and is unaffected by the recent announcement. </p>  <p>  I am encouraged by the company statement that it is fully committed to Ireland, that it will be seeking voluntary-led redundancies in the first instance and that these will not take place immediately but will be phased over an 18-month period.  The company has also stated that attractive redundancies terms will be offered, which should encourage a higher voluntary take-up.</p>  <p>  I have asked both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to redouble their efforts to secure new projects and expand existing operations in Cavan, and to explore all opportunities to replace the jobs being lost there.  Enterprise Ireland, has been very successful in recent years, with jobs in their client companies in the Irish-owned sector, having grown in County Cavan by 394 last year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Local Enterprise Office in the County, formerly the County Enterprise Board, has been working to develop the micro-enterprise sector in the county and has helped to develop start up enterprises.  That work will, of course, continue.</p>  <p>  In relation to the job numbers at the time of the 2011 purchase of Quinn Insurance, the commitment given at that time as part of the takeover was that the 1,570 staff in both jurisdictions were transferred under the EU&rsquo;s Protection of Employees Rights on Transfer of Undertakings to Liberty Insurance.  However this did not guarantee that these job levels would be retained indefinitely.  Unfortunately no new employer could give such a blanket guarantee, especially in a volatile and changing market sector.</p>  <p>  The State, though IDA Ireland, will continue to engage with the company to seek to influence corporate decisions and to broaden the scope of their operations here.  However there are constraints on State supports for companies, either multinational or Irish-owned, whose operations mainly involve the provision of a service for Irish customers, such as is now the case for Liberty Insurance.</p>  <p>  Despite the current setback, it should be highlighted that significant progress in addressing the problems of the wider Border region has been made over recent years.  As recently as Quarter 3 2012 the unemployment rate in that region stood at 17.7% but by Quarter 1 2015 that had fallen to 10.2%, which of course is still too high but represents a major improvement.  An additional 18,000 jobs were put in place over that period in the region which is an impressive  achievement. Jobs in Government-supported companies in Cavan have increased by 7% in the recent years following the crash.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres.  For this reason I have initiated the preparation of an Action Plan for Jobs for the Border region as part of the drive to increase the level of job creation across the country.  Eight Regional Action Plans will be delivered this year, building on the success of the national Action Plan for Jobs process, which has contributed to the creation of over 100,000 new jobs since 2012.  Significant progress has been made in preparing the Action Plan for the Border region, which of course includes County Cavan, in consultation with key stakeholders there.  My officials are currently finalising that Plan and I anticipate that it will be launched in the Autumn.</p></reply>

Such factors include, among other things, cost, security, data protection and efficient reuse.  My Department has in the past used open public procurement procedures to choose a recycling partner who is best able to meet its requirements.  As certain ICT equipment designated for disposal may have a residual value, it would not be feasible for my Department to provide such equipment to any one operator without offering it on an open basis through some form of competitive procurement process.  Future procurement processes related to this area are likely to be managed by the Office of Government Procurement.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has primary responsibility for the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill</i>, which was published on 19 January this year.  The Bill provides for the submission of National Low Carbon Transition and Mitigation plans and National Climate Change Adaptation Frameworks to the Government.</p><p>In anticipation of this legislation my Department began to prepare an agriculture and forest sector mitigation plan.  Following the publication of the outline heads of the Bill in 2013 my Department sought the views of our many stakeholders on what they considered important in formulating such a plan.  Since then my Department has continued to take an open consultative approach to the development of the plan.  A number of meetings with stakeholders were held during 2014.  Following this, a Discussion Document on the Potential for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation within the Agriculture and Forest Sector was opened to public consultation for an eight week period from 27 January to 23 March 2015.  Sixteen submissions were received from individuals and organisations including state and semi-state bodies, NGOs, business, farming and environmental groups.  A follow-up stakeholder consultation seminar took place in Portlaoise on 15 May to further explore the issues raised.  The aim of this consultation process was to stimulate thinking from the public and interested stakeholders on mitigation in the agriculture and forest sector.  Their input will now help to inform the preparation of the sectoral mitigation plan which will in turn feed into a national mitigation plan. </p><p>The sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans are also being informed by scientific evidence and research findings.  They will specify the policy measures to be undertaken for both mitigation and adaption and will be fundamental pillars of future national policy.  Given its importance on food production and economic grounds, the Irish agriculture sector must be in a position to anticipate and adapt to the negative impacts of climate change, as well as looking to maximise the benefits for the food production system.</p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, work is already underway on developing the National Mitigation Plan.  The primary objective of this Plan will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. </p></reply>

The Programme forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP) and over the next six years will allocate funding of some &euro;300 million to suckler farmers in Ireland.  The BDGP builds upon the large investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental and strategic improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the Irish beef herd.  It represents a major vote of confidence in the beef sector from this government and the initial figures suggest that the Programme has been fully subscribed.</p><p>As regards the penalty system, it is important to note that it includes appropriate tolerances where minor non-compliances occur in the various scheme requirements and no penalty will be applied in these cases.  Furthermore, in most cases where reductions in payment are applied, they relate to payment in the year in question rather than clawbacks of payments in previous years.  In more serious cases, however, a penalty will be applied and cases of serious non-compliance may result in recoupment of payment from previous years.  Further information on this matter is detailed in the Programme Terms and Conditions which were sent to all beef farmers and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  I am satisfied that the approach adopted reflects a proportionate response while remaining consistent with the governing regulations. </p><p><i>Force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal from the programme is caused by circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as illness or animal disease.  Without prejudice to the actual circumstances to be taken into consideration in individual cases, the Terms and Conditions note that the following categories of <i>force majeure</i>may be recognised:</p><p>- death of the beneficiary,</p><p>- long term professional incapacity of the beneficiary,</p><p>- expropriation of all or a large part of the holding if that expropriation could not have been anticipated on the day of lodging the application,</p><p>- severe natural disaster gravely affecting the holding,</p><p>- the accidental destruction of livestock buildings on the holding,</p><p>- an epizootic or a plant disease affecting part or all of the beneficiary's livestock or crops respectively.</p><p>I have already committed that the Department will examine each application for <i>force majeure</i>on a case by case basis. </p><p>My Department has also confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, as referred to by the Deputy, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds.  Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the Programme (the maximum payable area), he or she is required to continue to meet its terms and conditions on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The Programme builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which the country has made in recent years.  It will ultimately bring about fundamental and strategic improvements to the entire beef sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the national beef herd.  This is an objective I believe we all should share.</p><p>The replacement strategy is an essential element of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) if the overall objectives of the Programme are to be achieved, i.e. a reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the improvement of the genetic merit of the national beef herd.  Twenty per cent of the payment is for the purchase/breeding of 4 and 5 star heifers and this component of the overall payment is made in each year of the programme, starting in year one, although the participant is not required to fully meet the replacement requirement until 2020.  Any penalties for non compliance with this element of the Programme will apply only to that 20% component of the payment.</p><p>In the event that the participant achieves compliance for the replacement females of between ninety and ninety nine per cent, a proportionate reduction will be applied to that component of the payment based on the actual compliance level.  This provides some flexibility whereby farmers who go most of the way to meeting their requirement, but do not achieve 100% compliance, will only have a proportionate reduction applied and no additional penalty will be incurred.</p><p>However, if less than ninety per cent compliance is achieved by 2020, no payment will be made for that element of the total payment for that year, i.e. twenty per cent of the total payment.  In addition, a penalty of the equivalent amount will be imposed and any payments made in previous years for this element of the payment will be recovered.  As 20% of the payment each year relates to replacement females, it is necessary to reclaim this 20% proportion from the payment in later years where this requirement has not been met.  This is a central component of the programme and I believe that there is a sufficient lead in time for participants to achieve this requirement by 31 October 2020.  In addition, each participant will be provided with tailored BDGP training, together with ongoing information from ICBF which will assist them in developing a replacement strategy that will ensure that the replacement targets can be met with confidence on each holding. </p><p>This programme is aimed at committed suckler farmers who are willing to commit to this farming system for a 6 year period and experience from the past indicates that only a minority of farmers change farming practices in any given period.  As regards exiting the programme during the 6 year period, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is caused by circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as illness or animal disease.  If <i>force majeure</i>circumstances arise, such as death or the long term incapacity of the participant, then payments will not be recovered.  My Department has also confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds.  Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the Programme (the maximum payable area), he or she is required to continue to meet its terms and conditions on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

All applicants will be notified in writing of the outcome of their application and I anticipate contracts will commence in October and run until the end of 2020.  Based on the total value of applications received, I expect that the average payment will be in the order of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  It is not possible at this early stage to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy and this level of detail will only be available following the completion of all checks and the selection of successful applicants for approval into the scheme.  However, the qualifying score built into the system for evaluating Tier 3 applicants, i.e. those without Priority Environmental Assets, is based on a reasonable expectation of what can be achieved at holding level, equivalent for example to 10 hectares of low input permanent pasture, 15 Bat Boxes and 6 Bird Boxes.  This would generate the applicant a return of &euro;3,365, and I would therefore expect most applications to achieve or exceed this level of return.</p></reply>

Further analysis is needed to determine exactly the average number of farmers per commonage in GLAS, as some farmers operate on several commonages.</p>  <p>  What is clear is that there are commonage farmers who have not yet applied for the Scheme.  Some of these are undoubtedly in AEOS and intend to see out their AEOS contracts, confident in the knowledge that they will receive priority access to GLAS when they do decide to join.  Others may have waited in order to see if a commonage management plan is commenced on their particular commonage.  This option was open to farmers, given that commonage management plans can be joined at a later date and that priority access remains open to these farmers.   </p>  <p>  I would expect additional applications from Commonage farmers under the second tranche of GLAS, which opens in the Autumn.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the main targets in the Food Harvest report are, by 2020,  to increase the value of:</p><p>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33% <b>from &euro;4.5 billion to &euro;6.1 billion,</b></p><p>- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%, an <b>increase from the baseline figure of &euro;8.2 billion to of &euro;12 billion</b></p><p>- Value added production by 40%  from a 2008 baseline.</p><p><b>In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase </b>in<b></b>milk production by 2020 to be progressed once the cap on milk production was lifted in April 2015. </p><p>Progress on these targets is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  By end 2014, the value of all primary output increased significantly to <b>&euro;5,977m, </b>virtually reaching its target of a 33% increase.  Export performance has also been strong at &euro;10.45 billion, more than halfway towards achieving the 2020 target of &euro;12 billion and giving a <b>45% increase since 2009.</b>Value Added has increased to over &euro;7.5 billion which means it is more than two thirds of the way to its target increase of &euro;2.5bn by 2020. </p><p>Given that the final comprehensive review of Food Harvest 2020, Milestones 2014, was published last September, I decided that it was opportune time to look to the future and consider what the agri-food industry can achieve over the next decade to 2025.  I appointed Mr John Moloney to chair a 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee.  They have just concluded their work and I am looking forward to launching tomorrow their report with their expert recommendations on how best to maximise the opportunities open to this sector us over the next decade. </p><p>Irish agri-food producers already export to over 175 countries and the pointers for continuing expansion are favourable.  Targeted ministerial trade and investment missions together with the work of the Department&rsquo;s cross-divisional trade team opened up 8 new trade areas in 2013 and 9 in 2014.  I expect this success to continue particularly as our competitiveness levels improve.</p></reply>

It is a legal requirement to notify my Department of any suspicion of all relevant diseases, including those affecting bovines.  Vigilance against the introduction of 'Class A' disease, including foot and mouth disease, avian influenza, bluetongue and African swine fever, remains a priority for my Department and previous experience has demonstrated the absolute necessity of properly regulating trade, high levels of biosecurity, continued vigilance, contingency arrangements and robust legislation to deal speedily and effectively with disease threats and outbreaks.  </p>  <p>  My Department has contingency plans in place to deal with disease threats and outbreaks.  These plans are based on existing EU legislation and criteria identified during outbreaks in Europe and aim to mitigate the risk of disease introduction into Ireland and to control and eradicate them quickly if outbreaks occur.  The continued focus of the Department is on constantly reviewing, refining and updating our various contingency plans and arrangements and ensuring that we have all of the necessary measures in place and tools available to us to deal with any suspect or outbreak of these diseases. </p>  <p>  In the event of an outbreak or the threat of an outbreak, the key focus will be on bio-security measures at the optimal level on farms as well as ongoing co-operation contact with other state agencies (including NI), industry and farm representatives to ensure that a high degree of vigilance is being maintained with a view to preventing the incursion of the disease, in so far as this is possible, and to detect an outbreak at an early stage in order to prevent its spread.</p></reply>

Current beef prices in Ireland stand at 107% of the EU15 average.  As of the end of last week, the average prices paid (excluding VAT) for an R3 steer stood at &euro;4.15/kg and an R3 Heifer at &euro;4.26.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have provided a package worth over &euro;70 million for the beef sector in 2015.  This includes &euro;52 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme, and will involve a budget of some &euro;300m over a six year period.  The BDGP is intended to improve margins and deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  The Programme received close to 30,000 applications and the ongoing analysis of those applications indicates that the BDGP is fully subscribed.  I am also providing funding to improve management practices on farms, through the provision of grants and aid to Teagasc for their research, advisory and education services and through the provision of funding for technology adoption, breed improvement through ICBF, and improvements in animal health through AHI.</p><p>Of course, new market opportunities for both beef and live cattle exports also impact on the eventual returns to farmers.  The recent openings of the US market, to Irish beef and the lifting of the beef ban in China are major achievements in this regard.  I am always conscious of the need to find new markets for Irish beef and in that regard my Department, together with Bord Bia, will continue to target new export opportunities in third country markets. </p><p><b></b><b><i>Sheepmeat</i></b>- The industry wide strategy for developing the sheep industry in Ireland was set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document which envisages a 20% increase in the value of output by 2020.  My approach to building on the significant achievements of the strategy up until now is to drive the development of the industry at home and increase Ireland's market share of the world market.  This will ensure that producers and processors can plan for the future, increasing the value of the industry for the benefit of all.  The sheep sector has proved to be a resilient component of Irish stock farming over many years.  Indeed, the continuing interest in the sector on the part of sheep farmers is evidenced by the large numbers that attended the Sheep 2015 open day in Athenry on June 22nd, which was organised by Teagasc. </p><p>In terms of the performance of the sector in 2014, Irish sheep throughput at DAFM-approved plants was up slightly on 2013, with a marginal increase of 1%.  To date in 2015 throughput at DAFM approved plants is up by approximately 1% on the same period in 2014, and the average factory price is up by approximately 4% for the year to date as compared with the same period in 2014, though there has been a significant dip in price in recent weeks.  At producer level I continue to put in place incentives to ensure that producers see a viable future in the sector.</p><p>Under the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under the Knowledge Transfer measure which has a budget of &euro;100m.  The experience in the Sheep Technology and Adoption Programme (STAP) has informed the development of this measure.  In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and advisors in order to customise information exchange.  The Knowledge Transfer Programme for the sheep sector will be launched in 2016 when the current STAP concludes.  The proposed new agri-environment scheme, GLAS (Green Low-carbon Agri-environment Scheme) will also support, amongst others, extensive and hill farmers, who have shown themselves to be careful custodians of the countryside in previous agri-environment schemes.  It includes a menu of environmental actions, many of which will be suitable for sheep farmers. </p><p>On the export front I intend to drive further the search for new markets.  My Department, in consultation with the meat industry and in cooperation with Bord Bia and the Irish Embassies abroad, is constantly pushing for new markets and opportunities. During 2014, we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Lebanon, Namibia, Hong Kong and the Philippines thus allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat to those countries.  Also, during my Trade Mission to China in November 2014, I was able to hand over the completed version of a sheep questionnaire which is a key step in gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat.  This represents the first milestone on the road which will lead, I hope, to Ireland gaining access to the Chinese market for sheepmeat in the future.</p><p><b></b><b><i>PIGMEAT</i></b>- The development of the pig sector is a priority for me given that the industry accounted for almost 7% of the output value of the agri-food sector in 2014 and is the third most important sector after beef and dairy.  There are approximately 440 commercial pig producers producing about 3.5 million pigs annually.  The pig industry supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. </p><p>The Irish pig sector competes in an international environment.  Producers and processors face ongoing challenges from both other EU and international competitors and they must continually innovate and improve to maintain their presence in the international marketplace.  They are also reliant on existing markets remaining open.  The closure of the Russia market in 2014 is an example of the volatility which market closures can bring.  However market access opportunities secured by DAFM in Vietnam and the Philippines are helping to off-set the effects of closures elsewhere. </p><p>I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure in recent months and the difficulties that this causes for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain above the EU average and at week ending 21/6/15 the average Grade E price increased to &euro;154.04/100kg.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices.  This is a function of the market.</p><p><b>Earlier this year I called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and/or private storage aid.  This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year.  However due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme. </b></p><p>The threat of disease outbreak in the sector underscore the ongoing focus on animal health and disease prevention and control strategies.  In this regard I am pleased that the Rural Development Plan (TAMS II) includes funding targeted at improved farm animal health and welfare, in addition to funding for housing, investments in energy, water meters and medicine dispensers which will benefit the sector</p><p>The research and targeted promotional work being carried but by a wide range of stakeholders, together with the acknowledgement of the quality, sustainability and competitiveness of Irish pig meat will help to position the sector in the future. </p><p>My Department has recently initiated a Pig Industry Stakeholder Group chaired by Dr Sean Brady.  This group will examine the various aspects of the industry. Elements such as quality, food safety, animal welfare and environmental sustainability, which are at the core of policy initiatives such as Food Harvest, Bord Bia Quality Assurance Programme and Origin Green.</p><p><b></b><b><i>Poultry</i></b>- The poultry sector is an important sector in the Irish economy accounting for almost 2% of agricultural output and about 6,000 jobs primarily in rural areas.  Poultry is considered a versatile source of protein and consumption has improved over the last few years.  The predominant outlet for Irish chicken is the Irish retail market, where there is storing demand for fresh raw Irish product.</p><p>A growing understanding and utilisation of so-called 5th Quarter products, such as feet, together with international demand for cuts which are not in demand domestically, will ensure the continuation of export opportunities.  The sector has benefited in the past from a number of support initiatives, including the provision of capital investment grants, ongoing Bord Bia promotional campaigns and the development and operation of the Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Programme (PQAS).</p><p>Support will also be provided through funding under the Rural Development Programme to upgrade existing buildings and funding to support the construction of new housing, animal welfare and safety, as well as participation in Poultry Discussion Groups.</p><p><b></b><b><i>Dairy</i></b>- The farm gate milk price currently stands in the region of 30-31 cents per litre including VAT and bonuses.  However sentiment had improved somewhat earlier in 2015 primarily based on broadly positive auction results at the Global Dairy Trade Auction (GDT).  The positive momentum in dairy markets early in the year was welcome and had contributed to a return of more positive market sentiment.  More recent results, however, have seen some decreases and have brought the index back to late 2014/January 2015 levels. </p><p>There is no doubt that softening of global dairy markets has had an impact on dairy farmers in Ireland and throughout the EU.  The price situation in Ireland is not much different from other EU MS reflecting the global nature of this problem.  Using cross country comparable data from the EU Milk Market Observatory the most recently available complete data shows that the milk price in Ireland is approximately 22% below the same month in 2014, slightly above the 18% decrease on average across the EU.  The announcement by Russia that it has extended its trade ban for another year will not help an already difficult situation.</p><p>Overall however I remain confident about the medium to longer term prospects for the sector which I believe continues to be very bright, with growing global demand expected to support prices in the years ahead, but it is clear that there will be continuing volatility around this positive trend.  My focus now is ensuring that the correct balance of policies and supports are in place so that the Irish dairy sector can overcome the effects of volatility over the next while. </p></reply>

The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in Ireland in recent years.  It will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the overall genetic quality of the national beef herd, which is an objective I believe we all should share.  </p>  <p>  The BDGP was launched on 5 May and my Department received just under 30,000 applications by the extended closing date of 5 June.  While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, I am delighted to record that the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed.  This level of interest is, I believe, a vindication of our efforts to further improve suckler farming.  It is also testimony to the commitment of suckler farms in Ireland to continuous improvement and their openness to innovation where it can deliver real measurable benefits.   </p>  <p>  The BDGP is the next logical step in the development of our suckler herd.  It builds on the schemes operated by my Department in recent years and most of the actions will already be familiar to the majority of farmers entering the scheme, including the data recording elements and the genotyping requirements. </p>  <p>  Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers.  Program participants can contact my Department directly with any specific queries they may have regarding scheme conditions.  They will also receive additional information specific to their herds in the coming weeks from ICBF which will provide a useful overview of the current euro star ratings of the animals on their herds.  This will then be followed by dedicated training courses which scheme participants will be paid to attend. </p>  <p>  I know that concerns have been raised by different farming organisations, including the Irish Farmers' Association, and where possible I have moved to address the concerns raised.  Additional flexibility has been included to permit the use of 2015, as opposed to 2014, as the base year for payments, in certain circumstances.  The concerns regarding scheme exit have also been considered and my Department has confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds.  Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the Programme, he or she is required to continue to meet the terms of the Programme. </p>  <p>  Finally, I have committed to a mid-term review of the operation of the programme, which will include input from all of the stakeholders, including farm organisations.  For now, I would like to welcome the 30,000 or so applicants to the scheme and assure them of continued support over the lifetime of the scheme from my Department, Teagasc and ICBF so that they may derive maximum benefit from the scheme for their farm.</p></reply>

This should lead over time to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and result in more sustainable fishing patterns.  The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2015 where possible and by 2020 at the latest.  As president of the Council during the CFP negotiations, it fell to me to broker an agreement on this important issue between the co-legislators.  In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.  The TACs and quotas for 2015, as agreed at the December Agriculture &amp;amp; Fisheries Council of Ministers meeting, take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.   </p>  <p>  Another key element of the new CFP is the introduction of a regionalised decision-making process.  This gives Member States greater power to make decisions on the management of their own fish stocks and moves away from the former "one size fits all" approach.  Ireland is a member of the North Western Waters Group along with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.   </p>  <p>  The phased introduction of a landing obligation/discarding ban, as set out in the CFP, represents a fundamental shift in fisheries policy and fishing practices.  A discards plan for pelagic stocks in North Western Waters, developed by Ireland and the other Member States of the North Western Waters Group in consultation with the Advisory Council, has been in place since 1 January 2015. </p>  <p>  An agreement among the North Western Waters Group on a discard plan for certain demersal stocks (whitefish and prawns) was recently brokered by Ireland.  The ban on discarding will be extended to prawns (nephrops) in all waters around Ireland, whiting in the Celtic Sea and haddock in the Irish Sea and in the North West area from 1 January 2016.  The landing obligation will be rolled out to other fisheries over the period to 2019 when it will apply to all stocks. </p>  <p>  The work on the discard plan was carried out in close consultation with the North Western Waters Advisory Council.  It is expected that over time the landing obligation will lead to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.   </p>  <p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland's overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-07-01a.350.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015070100086#WRL01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 134 together. </p><p>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law.  Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  In other words, a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output.  This is commonly referred to as the &quot;one step forward one step backward&quot; traceability system.  There are additional traceability requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and its Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p><p>Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products are laid down in EU legislation.  For beef, compulsory labelling rules have been in place for many years, and require food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived.  This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, as well as the country in which it was born, reared and slaughtered.</p><p>In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169/2011, which is applicable to all foods intended for the final consumer and including foods delivered to mass caterers.  This Regulation has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas.  In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time.  The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337/2013, which introduced mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats with effect from 1 April 2015.  Under this regulation, <b>labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats</b>. The term &lsquo;<b>Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth </b>is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter. </p><p>Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules and I have signed into law a new Statutory Instrument No. 113 to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement and a period of compliance building has now begun.  In addition, my Department is liaising with the Department of Health with a view to extending the legislation to include &quot;loose meats&quot; e.g. meat cuts that sold through butcher counters. </p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for general food labelling legislation.  However, my Department and, in the case of fish or fishery products, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, play an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Under EU law primary responsibility for the safety and traceability of food placed in the market place lies with food business operators.  The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant.  The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. </p><p>As regards the import of products of animal origin from third countries, this is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. </p><p>Import controls on products of animal origin, including fish and fishery products, arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented.  Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation.  Third countries exporting to the EU must be approved to export fishery products to the EU and these countries are subject to audit by the Commission's FVO.</p></reply>

It provided Irish farmers and the agri-food sector with policy certainty for the years to come and with strategic financial support to increase sustainability and enhance competitiveness.  I will continue to work with my EU colleagues to ensure that we engage in policies that promote the interests of the EU agricultural sector.</p><p>Teagasc&rsquo;s National Farm Survey 2013, which represents just over 79,000 farms, estimated that:</p><p>- 35% of farms were economically viable.  An economically viable farm is defined as one that has the capacity to pay family labour at the average agricultural wage, and also to provide a 5% return on non-land assets.</p><p>- 32% of farms were sustainable.  A sustainable farm is not economically viable but it is sustainable due to the presence of off-farm income.</p><p>- The remaining 33% of farms were classified as 'vulnerable'.</p><p>Around 60,000 farms are excluded from the National Farm Survey because their standard output is less than &euro;8,000.  Most of these farms are small, but many may be sustainable due to off-farm sources of income.</p><p>It is clear that there remain profitability issues at farm level that need to be addressed.  This is one of the reasons why I appointed a 2025 Agri-Food Strategy Committee late last year to devise a strategy for the continued development of the sector to 2025.  The Committee submitted its report to me at the end of last month with key recommendations and actions it considers necessary to allow us set ever more challenging goals for the longer term.  I am currently examining the report.</p></reply>

Non-EU markets accounted for 28% of total Irish agri-food exports last year, with significant potential for further growth.</p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister, I have led several successful trade missions to facilitate trade promotion and market access to markets outside the EU, including to the United States, China, the Gulf States and Algeria. These visits provided the numerous Irish companies who accompanied me with an opportunity to increase their profile in new markets and build upon existing trade relationships. My visits to China and the US were also instrumental in helping to re-open these valuable markets to Irish beef. </p>  <p>  To date this year, I have:</p>  <p> - led a successful trade mission to the US in February to launch beef access to this very valuable market;</p>  <p> - welcomed Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Agriculture Minister Han Changfu on a farm visit in Mayo, which proved an invaluable opportunity to demonstrate the best of Irish farming to the Chinese Government and the Chinese media;</p>  <p> - hosted meetings with Ministers and high level delegations from several non-EU countries.</p>  <p>  I am presently finalising plans to lead trade missions to the US and to Asia, including China, in the last quarter of 2015. I will also lead a trade mission to West Africa.

The outcome has a crucial bearing on the development of the Irish agri-food sector in accordance with the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. It also makes an important contribution to the achievement of the objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The changes are consistent with the smart, green, growth objectives of Food Harvest and provide farmers and the agri-food sector with stability and policy certainty to 2020.</p><p>There were three key aspects to the 2013 reforms:</p><p>1. Greater emphasis has been placed on sustainability through the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of direct payments and the requirement to support agri-environment measures in rural development programmes;</p><p>2. New and enhanced supports have been introduced for young farmers under both pillars on the CAP;</p><p>3. The reformed CAP has continued the movement towards greater market orientation, through the phasing out of production quotas for key products, the provision of safety-net supports in the case of severe market disturbance and the introduction of flexible measures that can be mobilised promptly and effectively to deal with crises.</p><p>Already the additional flexibility to manage crises has allowed the EU Commission to introduce additional market support measures to address the effects of the Russian import ban on EU agri-food products. The changes made to the direct payments system, including the provisions on greening, come into force this year and I am convinced that the reforms will help the agri-food sector in Ireland to achieve its full potential. Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP) was formally adopted by the EU Commission at the end of May <i>and marks the next step in the roll out of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy. Implementation has commenced of a number of key schemes contained in our RDP and the continued roll out of RDP schemes and supports will help to underpin economic growth and development throughout rural Ireland.</i></p><p>In short, I believe that the reforms agreed under Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union underpin the sustainable intensification of production in the years ahead, will support environmental stewardship and contribute to the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy.</p></reply>

Magee Barracks was one of the barracks identified for closure and disposal. On 1st July 2003 the Government decided the former Magee Barracks in Kildare Town would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. On foot of this Government decision Kildare County Council prepared a local area plan for the site which encompassed a range of uses including community use. Following discussions between the Department, Kildare County Council and the then Department of Environment, Heritage &amp;amp; Local Government, and in accordance with the terms of the Housing Initiative, it was agreed that the entire site would be transferred to Kildare County Council. A final Contract for transfer was issued to Kildare County Council in January 2009. However, the Council advised the Department that it no longer wished to take possession of the property.</p>  <p>  In September 2011, the Department, in response to a request from the Council seeking submissions for the proposed Local Area Plan for Kildare Town, advised the Council of the intention to sell the site. The Department also advised the Council that it recognised the site provides a unique opportunity for the development of Kildare Town and remains prepared to facilitate this subject to achieving a satisfactory return for the property in order to provide revenue for reinvestment in the Defence Forces. The Kildare Town Local Development Plan 2012-2018 has made provision for substantial community developments on the barracks site which undoubtedly will be reflected in the value of the site to a developer.</p>  <p>  It is now proposed to dispose of the remaining c.54 acres of the Barracks by public auction later this year. It is my view that the obligation to community development was met by the offer to transfer the full site to Kildare County Council and the subsequent Local Development Plan which makes provision for community developments on the site.</p>  <p>  Also, eight acres on the Barrack site is currently being developed for local schools. Officials from my Department recently met with the CEO from Kildare County Council. Discussions included the Department&rsquo;s intention to dispose of the remaining c. 54 acres of the site by public auction. In the interim, the Department remains open to proposals from the Council, subject to achieving a satisfactory return for the property.</p></reply>

That is to say, they remain in RIA accommodation until such time as they are either removed from the State or are granted some form of status allowing them to stay in the State.</p><p>The Direct Provision system is the mechanism through which the State provides for the basic needs of asylum seekers.  Full board accommodation and ancillary supports are provided across all direct provision centres.  The RIA currently operates 34 accommodation centres across the State with 4,574 residents.  Further details can be found on the RIA website at .  Approximately, 480 persons who have permission to remain in the State remain in RIA accommodation and this is directly related, in most cases, to the acute shortage of rental accommodation.  Based on experience in previous years, this number will reduce over the summer months as residents source private accommodation following the end of the school year for their children.</p><p>Once an RIA resident has been granted some form of status allowing them remain in the State, they are then in a position to apply for a range of social welfare supports, including rent supplement (or Housing Assistance Payments where those apply).  Naturally, there is a lead-in time for such persons during which they register for appropriate supports, including sourcing their own accommodation outside of the direct provision system, arranging school placements for their children and linking with any specialist medical or other supports at their new address.  In addition to the time taken to resolve these issues, the availability of accommodation in the private rented sector and rates of rent may impact on the lead-in time for residents moving on from direct provision accommodation.</p><p>Once the RIA is aware that some form of status has been granted, the resident is written to notifying them that they should commence planning for their future outside the direct provision system.  The 'moving on process' process has extended in recent years largely because of the increasing difficulties in sourcing private accommodation.  It is not a situation of RIA's making and quite clearly neither it nor the Department would render people homeless in circumstances not within their control.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that the CSO has recently published new crime statistics up to end of the first quarter of 2015 and are best placed to provide the type of statistical information and analysis requested by the Deputy.  I have requested the CSO to provide the available statistical information directly to him.</p>  <p>  I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the deployment of Garda personnel and the assignment of specific duties in relation to burglary or other types of crime is a matter for the Garda authorities and I have no direct role in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am, of course, very conscious of the impact of burglaries on households throughout the country, and earlier this year I carried out a broad and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to this problem.  This included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.</p>  <p>  Arising from this review I recently published the heads of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill which targets repeat burglary offenders through new measures relating to bail and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.</p>  <p>  Garda operational strategy in relation to burglary is coordinated under Operation Fiacla which had led to 13,027 arrests and 7,394 charges being brought up to 30 April this year.  Under Operation Fiacla Garda&iacute; have made full use of communications technology and, where necessary, specialist resources including the armed Regional Support Units and the Air Support Unit to target the activities of mobile gangs engaged in burglary crime.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Commissioner has recently indicated that there will be a renewed Garda focus on burglary with an emphasis on enforcement, crime prevention, education, partnerships, and supporting victims.  Criminal gangs operating nationally and locally will be targeted along with dedicated patrolling in areas where there is a high incidence of burglary.  I am in ongoing contact with the Commissioner regarding these strategies and, in this regard, have made specific funding of &euro;700,000 available for new specialised vehicles to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to offences being committed by highly-mobile gangs.</p></reply>

An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches that might be considered in an Irish context.</p></reply>

The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating in sourcing several solutions to meeting the issues arising in relation to nurse recruitment and retention. </p>  <p>  The background to this issue is that nurses who trained in a country outside of Ireland and wish to work in Ireland are required to apply to register as a nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  In assessing an applicant for registration, to protect the public, the NMBI seeks evidence from applicants of comparable standards of education and practice.  According to the NMBI the timeframe for the completion of the assessment of qualifications for registration takes up to a maximum of 90 days provided all necessary documentation has been supplied by the applicant. </p>  <p>  The main difficulty to expediting timely applications as reported by the NMBI is that of delay or failure by the applicant or third parties to furnish the necessary documentation required to assess eligibility for registration.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, following assessment of qualifications by an applicant, may require an applicant to undertake a six to twelve week period of adaptation and assessment. A period of adaptation is designed to make up for differences in education and ensure competence for working in the Irish health service. If this adaptation is required it must be successfully completed as a pre-requisite to registration. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the NMBI are dealing with very significant volumes of applications at present.  The NMBI are processing all applications as quickly as possible, while ensuring appropriate procedures and checks which are designed around protection of the public.  </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputies that officials of the Department met with the President and the Chief Executive Officer of the NMBI last week to discuss a range of operational issues including the current delays in Registration. The NMBI are keeping the current situation under review and the Deputies may wish to note that the NMBI have been allocated additional resources to address the issues.</p></reply>

In conjunction with other services and supports, methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.</p>  <p>  The latest figures from the HSE indicate that over 9,890 clients were receiving methadone maintenance treatment at the end of April 2015.  The National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol is currently undertaking a survey which will provide an up-to-date estimate of the current number of heroin users, as the most recent national estimate dates back to 2006.  The results of the survey are expected later this year.</p>  <p>  Harm reduction interventions, which include methadone maintenance treatment and needle exchange services, are an important component of the response to problem substance use as such interventions encourage problem substance users to engage with, and avail of, drug treatment services.  The expansion of needle exchange outside Dublin with the support of funding from the Elton John Aids Foundation, has resulted in the recruitment and training of over 130 community pharmacies.  During 2014, over 42,000 packs containing over 240,000 needles were given out.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;2.1 million was provided in the HSE budget for 2015 for a series of measures targeting vulnerable problem drug users, including an additional 53 beds in residential treatment and rehabilitation facilities creating 439 treatments.  This year, the Government has also stepped up the efforts to reduce drug-related deaths and near-fatal drug poisonings.  The HSE Naloxone pilot project which is currently underway involves 600 patients receiving take-home Naloxone and the provision of training to lay persons, such as the family and friends of a drug user, in the administration of a Naloxone injection to overdose victims.  Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone in overdoses.</p>  <p>  Those struggling with drug problems may have multiple needs, such as poverty, housing, poor health and education, which require multiple interventions involving a range of different agencies.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework, which is currently being rolled out across the country, aims to ensure continuity of care for recovering drug users by promoting a client-centred approach to rehabilitation, based on shared care planning.</p></reply>

However, every person with a drug problem has their own individual needs and their own personal goals for recovery.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group, set up by my Department in 2006, examined the regulatory framework required to facilitate the prescribing, dispensing and supply of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  In 2011, this Group concluded that methadone is the drug of first choice in the treatment of opioid dependency, but that buprenorphine/naloxone may be more appropriate for particular cohorts of clients.</p>  <p>  The HSE established an Opioid Substitution Implementation Group in June 2013 to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  The Group submitted a draft report to the Director General of the HSE on 4 June 2015.  The Group is expected to report to the Minister of Health shortly.</p></reply>

In conjunction with other services and supports, methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  The latest figures from the HSE indicate that over 9,892 clients were receiving methadone maintenance treatment at the end of April 2015.  Retention in methadone treatment is generally considered a positive goal in service provision.</p><p>Treatment interventions, including methadone maintenance, have been shown to result in reduced drug use, as well as improved health and social outcomes for clients, and a reduction in drug-related crime.  Harm reduction interventions, such as needle exchange, also result in better health outcomes for clients, reducing the incidence of blood-borne viruses.  There is clear evidence that having access to drug treatment is one of the main factors in reducing drug-related deaths.</p><p>Details of the expenditure attributable to drugs programmes from 2009 to date, as well as the estimated allocation for 2015, are outlined in the following table.  The decrease in HSE expenditure in 2011 compared to 2010 arose due to savings achieved as a result of the public service pay cut, HSE staffing redundancies and a reduction in funding to Voluntary and Community Agencies.  Further savings were identified by the HSE in 2014 and these have been taken account of in determining the 2015 allocation.  I am advised by the HSE that frontline services have been maintained and no reductions have been made to existing services in 2015.</p><p>The reduction in the Department of Health allocation in 2014 and 2015 respectively reflects the fact that the Department transferred &euro;21.04m in funding relating to Drug and Alcohol Task Force projects to the HSE on 1st January 2014, with a further &euro;1.02m transferring on 1 January 2015.<table><tr><th>Department/Agency</th><th>2009 (&euro;m)</th><th>2010  (&euro;m)</th><th>2011  (&euro;m)</th><th>2012  (&euro;m)</th><th>2013  (&euro;m)</th><th>2014  (&euro;m)</th><th>2015  (&euro;m)</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Addiction Services</td><td>104.867</td><td>105.400</td><td>92.878</td><td>89.368</td><td>90.392</td><td>86.122</td><td>86.279</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Drug and Alcohol Task Force Projects</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>21.570</td><td>22.593</td></tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td><td>45.004</td><td>44.500</td><td>45.014</td><td>45.850</td><td>44.000</td><td>43.000</td><td>43.000</td></tr><tr><td>D/Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs</td><td>28.501</td><td>25.740</td><td>24.987</td><td>22.730</td><td>20.310</td><td>19.548</td><td>19.548</td></tr><tr><td>D/Justice &amp;amp; Equality</td><td>14.801</td><td>14.478</td><td>18.681</td><td>18.580</td><td>18.553</td><td>18.762</td><td>18.928</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Customs Service</td><td>15.867</td><td>15.797</td><td>15.470</td><td>14.241</td><td>14.624</td><td>16.235</td><td>16.235</td></tr><tr><td>D/Social Protection (former F&Aacute;S area)</td><td>18.800</td><td>18.000</td><td>15.634</td><td>11.859</td><td>13.434</td><td>14.063</td><td>13.702</td></tr><tr><td>D/Health</td><td>40.326</td><td>35.755</td><td>33.554</td><td>32.376</td><td>30.524</td><td>8.280</td><td>7.350</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Prison Service</td><td>5.000</td><td>5.200</td><td>5.200</td><td>5.000</td><td>4.500</td><td>4.200</td><td>4.285</td></tr><tr><td>D/Education &amp;amp; Skills</td><td>3.643</td><td>2.461</td><td>0.411</td><td>0.815</td><td>0.810</td><td>0.748</td><td>0.746</td></tr><tr><td>D/Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government</td><td>0.461</td><td>0.461</td><td>0.400</td><td>0.200</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>277.270</td><td>267.792</td><td>252.229</td><td>241.019</td><td>237.147</td><td>232.528</td><td>232.666</td></tr></table></p></reply>

No further comment can be provided at this time as the assessment process is ongoing.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website -  - and also by phone. The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p><p>The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them. The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>Similar to other healthcare schemes operated by EU Member States under Community legislation, access to healthcare abroad  under the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways, hence the HSE has in particular concentrated on informing the doctors who make the referrals.  For example, prior to the transposition of the Directive the HSE met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the new Directive.  The HSE has also participated in an EU Patients Forum conference which was held in Dublin in April to inform patient groups of the Directive.  </p><p>Additionally, the HSE is at this time actively engaged with consultants representing two specific cohorts of patients to facilitate access to certain diagnostics and treatment for which there are long waiting lists in Ireland.  The HSE welcomes requests from Hospital Medical Boards to present and inform the doctors of the provision to refer patients to other EU/EEA countries for healthcare under the terms of the Directive.</p></reply>

The lead Department for this initiative is the Department of Health.  Contained within this document are a number of commitments from various Government Departments and agencies. In respect of the higher education sector, the HEA has committed to three specific actions, namely, work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide-risk and critical-incident response, thereby helping to address any gaps which may exist in the prevention of suicide in higher education; support the co-ordination and streamlining of research completed by third-level institutions and encourage the coordination of suicide-prevention initiatives and research across the higher education sector.</p><p>The Connecting for Life document is available online at .  Enquiries in respect of the Connecting for Life initiative should be directed to the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP). The NSOP also has responsibility for initiatives such as SafeTalk and ASIST. SafeTalk and ASIST are two internationally accredited suicide prevention programmes for adults. Both programmes provide competence and confidence for participants to engage with a person who may be experiencing emotional crisis and encourage that person to seek appropriate help. SafeTalk is a half day training programme and ASIST training is provided over two days. Training is provided free of charge by the National Office for Suicide Prevention. Training can be organised through the team of Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention located around the country.</p><p>The NOSP also fund a number of programmes targeted at young people, including third level students. This includes services provided by Reach Out, Inspire Ireland, SpunOut.ie, BeLongTo and Young Social Innovators. Services provided includes: information and advice for students and online presence including online therapeutic support. The NSOP works with the Union of Students of Ireland as a key partner. The contact details for the NOSP are: phone 01-6201672 or e-mail info@nosp.ie.</p><p>The Student Assistance Fund is managed by the Higher Education Authority on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. The Fund is allocated annually to the universities, the institutes of technology, the colleges of education and a number of other higher education institutions. The objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to full-time undergraduate or postgraduate students in need of such support. The Fund is intended to support students whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.</p><p>The Fund is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with ongoing needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems. In all cases, institutions are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.</p><p>The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is funded by the Department of Social Protection. Enquiries in respect of the BTEA scheme should be referred to that Department.</p></reply>

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.</p>  <p>  Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is designed to promote positive mental health. It is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and a resource directory. The Department has also issued guidelines to schools on the development of whole-school policies in areas such as anti-bullying, relationship and sexuality education, substance misuse, managing critical incidents, whole-school guidance planning etc. which are also important in promoting positive mental health.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that I and my colleague, Minister of State Kathleen Lynch, launched "Well-being in primary schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion" on 29th January 2015. The 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' were published by my Department in 2013. Both guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated whole school way.</p></reply>

A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry to an approved course or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous October. Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p>  <p>  Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians is provided, can candidates who are under 23 be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address.</p>  <p>  The assessment of a case of estrangement is carefully considered to ensure there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances pertaining in such cases genuinely exists. The type of evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances.  It is difficult to legislate for all possible scenarios that can lead to genuine estrangement cases. Setting out guidelines as to how students can demonstrate estrangement will by their very nature, restrict the assessment of estrangement cases to those that fall within these guidelines. Such restrictions may not be in the best interest of students genuinely in this situation.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the current arrangements.</p></reply>

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Under the Equal Status Act schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single-sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-8738700.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, I published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in early April.  The Bill provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single-sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.  The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the Health Service Executive and the Environmental Protection Agency.  As part of the Strategy I will be establishing a new grant scheme to assist with the replacement of lead pipes in homes.  Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016.  It is envisaged that the grant scheme will be administered by local authorities and that the available resources will be prioritised to areas of highest risk.  It will be important to ensure that the limited financial resources available are targeted where needed most, particularly to householders on lower incomes.  Income thresholds and other eligibility will therefore apply.  The terms and conditions of the new scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised.  </p><p>Householders undertaking replacement works in advance of the new scheme should have regard to the assistance which may be available under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced under Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including plumbing works. The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on Revenue's website at:.</p></reply>

In the case of the four Dublin local authorities, the minimum proportion of all available dwellings to be allocated to this cohort is 50%, while in the case of the local authorities in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, the figure has been set at 30%.  It is expected that during the timeframe at least 500 homes will be provided to prioritised households in the Dublin Region with a similar total for the other areas combined.

The CER was initially established as the Commission for Electricity Regulation under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002, CER's remit was expanded to include the regulation of the natural gas sector and its name was changed to the Commission for Energy Regulation. It has a wide range of economic, customer protection and safety responsibilities in the energy sector. The CER is financed by means of a levy on industry and is not a cost on the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Members of the CER, also known as Commissioners, are appointed by the Minister pursuant to Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act, as amended, and the names of current and past CER Commissioners are provided in successive published annual reports. The current Commissioners are Mr. Garrett Blaney, Mr. Paul McGowan and Ms. Aoife MacEvilly who have, to date, held office for approximately five years, two years, and nine months, respectively. There have been four other Commissioners since the establishment of the CER, namely Mr. Tom Reeves, Mr. Michael Tutty, Ms. Regina Finn and Mr. Dermot Nolan, who held office for approximately ten years, seven years, one year, and six years, respectively. The appointment of other staff members, including directors, is an operational matter for the CER. </p>  <p>  The authority structure, operation and functions of the CER are set out in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as amended. Pursuant to Section 25 of Schedule 1 of the Act, as amended, the CER is obliged to present an annual report and accounts to the Minister. These reports and accounts, including information on costs, are publicly available on the CER website. Pursuant to Section 26 of Schedule 1, the CER is accountable to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.</p></reply>

These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services and include the town of Boyle Co Roscommon. The AMBER areas on the map show the target areas where the State will be obliged to intervene to ensure the availability of high speed broadband services. </p><p>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country including County Roscommon.</p><p>According to the publicly available information on eircom's website () Boyle has already seen a number of upgrades under the company's e-fibre investment programme, with one further upgrade nearing completion. Where parts of the town or its environs are not covered by commercial high speed services, these will be the target for the State's intervention.</p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads such as the M7 Bypass Upgrade, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. The Osberstown interchange and Sallins bypass fall within the remit of Kildare County Council. Works on these roads are funded from the local authority's own resources, supplemented by funding made available by the State. I am very much aware of the importance of these projects both locally and nationally.  Unfortunately, the financial realities are that capital funding will continue to be tight for the next number of years limiting the scope for progressing additional new projects over and above the PPP programme already in place.</p>  <p>  I know that it is important to restore over time capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that land transport infrastructure is maintained, and renewed to support economic development. While I have, I hope, stabilised the funding position, the scope for any new improvement projects depends on the availability of additional capital funding in the future.  Once the new capital plan is published I will assess what can be done to address particular bottlenecks. </p>  <p>  Requests for meetings should be made directly to the Diary Team of my private office.</p></reply>

On that basis, if fees were reduced by 25% it would potentially result in a saving in the order of &euro;50,000.  However, I am advised that expenditure on board fees is expected to fall in 2015, mainly because some board members who could claim fees have waived their fee on a voluntary basis. Consequently, the savings that could potentially arise from any given percentage reduction in fees may be less than the level indicated above.</p><p>In the interest of completeness, it should be noted that appointments to the boards of Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, as agencies of the North South Implementation Body, are made by the North South Ministerial Council.  Details of fees in relation to these boards may be found on the websites and .</p></reply>
