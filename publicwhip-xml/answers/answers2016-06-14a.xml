A link to the relevant documents can be found on the Galway City and County Council websites.  The proposed Strategy was presented to Galway City Council's Transport Strategic Policy Committee on 19 April.</p>  <p>  The draft Galway Transport Strategy outlines emerging proposals for revised traffic and public transport networks to better meet the city's needs.  Completion of the proposed Galway outer orbital road will support and complement implementation of the draft Strategy.</p>  <p>  I understand that the objective is to secure the incorporation of the agreed Strategy into the draft Galway City Development Plan 2017-2023.  This, of course, is a matter for the Council itself.</p>  <p>  With regard to funding for public transport for Galway in general, my Department provides funding under the Regional Cities Programme to the NTA for the development of bus lanes, green routes, other bus priority measures and safety measures for pedestrians &amp;amp; cyclists in the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  Overall funding for this programme in 2016 is &euro;13.5m of which Galway has an allocation of &euro;2.14m.</p></reply>

I wish them all well in their Ministerial roles and look forward to working constructively with them through the North South Ministerial Council and bi-laterally where appropriate.  I have recently met with my counterpart from the UK government informally in Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  While the referendum is a matter for UK voters to decide, the Government's preference is for the UK to remain in the EU.  Should the electorate instead vote to leave the EU, a period of two years is provided for under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union during which its exit terms would be negotiated between the UK and the other Member States.  The structure of such negotiations is unknown.  It is only as they mature that the shape of a future EU-UK relationship would begin to emerge and the full extent of the likely impact on Ireland would be clearer.</p>  <p>  As part of wider Government preparations, my Department continues to work with other Government Departments through an inter-departmental committee to identify the strategic and operational risks that may arise from a 'leave' vote and to prepare contingency planning.  As matters evolve I will be reviewing any potential impacts on functions relating to my Department, including in particular co-operation with Northern Ireland, and will engage with my counterparts in the Northern Executive and Westminster as required​.</p></reply>

By 2021, our capital envelope will have increased to &euro;2 billion.</p><p>At &euro;720 million, the largest portion of this year's capital envelope is allocated to national, regional and local roads.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland and I have referred the Deputy's question to TII for direct reply on such projects.</p><p>As regards regional and local roads, implementation is the responsibility of road authorities.  My Department is liaising with the relevant authorities to finalise an implementation programme for projects in the Capital Plan.  An initial allocation has been made to South Dublin County Council to upgrade roads into Grange Castle Business Park.</p><p>This year's Public Transport Investment Programme has a capital budget of &euro;347 million.  Most is delivering existing commitments, including LUAS CrossCity.  Construction of Metro North will commence around 2021 to be operational around 2026/27.  The Plan also provides for further progress in DART expansion. </p><p>The Capital Plan also includes: </p><p>- &euro;285m for local and national sports facilities;</p><p>-&euro;131m for tourism product development,</p><p>- &euro;100m for smarter travel and sustainable development including Greenways, and </p><p>- &euro;28m for the Regional Airports Programme.</p><p>On sport, we expect completion of Phase 1 of the Indoor Arena in November.  An allocation of &euro;30m has been ringfenced for Pairc Ui Chaoimh, subject to EU state aid approval. Much of the remaining sports funding relates to demand-led schemes such as the Sports Capital Programme.  These grant allocations are published and available. Smarter Travel and Sustainable Development projects are also demand-led and are largely committed in the short term.</p><p>For tourism, the Capital Plan includes a 7 year allocation of &euro;131m.  The existing Experience Brands, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin: A Breath of Fresh Air will be developed. In addition, a new Grants Scheme for Large Tourism Projects was launched on 8<sup>th</sup>June last.</p><p>The Capital Plan earmarks &euro;28m towards the Regional Airports Programme and I expect this year's allocation of &euro;3.8m to be spent by year end.  This funding supports the four airports in Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry and Waterford in key safety and security enhancements.</p></reply>

In keeping with the revised project timeline, the Government funding is to be provided in three tranches of &pound;25 million in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.  I have no function in relation to funding commitments of the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></reply>

This work finds tangible form in the development of new commuter friendly initiatives such as the National Journey Planner, Real Time Passenger Information and of course the Leap Card, all of which provide for better integrated public transport services and aid accessibility for the commuter.  There has also been considerable investment in public transport infrastructure improvements aimed at promoting better integration between different modes, such as the development of Park &amp;amp; Ride facilities.  Funding is also being provided toward integrated bus and rail stations, such as on-going works to improve linkage between Kent Station to Cork City Centre and the completion of a Rail/Bus Plaza area at Colbert Station.</p>  <p>  The NTA's recently published Transport Strategy for the GDA seeks to provide for the efficient, effective and sustainable movement of people and goods and includes a wide range of measures which will further improve integration between public transport modes. As required under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the NTA is now preparing an implementation plan for the first six year period of the Strategy and I expect the Deputy will have some useful observations to make when the NTA commences its consultation period on that plan.</p>  <p>  In terms of the value for money achieved in the delivery of our public transport services, there are now public service contracts in place between the NTA and all public transport operators providing PSO services.

The airline has publicly stated that it always follows the rules and regulations in all the markets in which it operates and offers employees competitive wages and conditions.</p>  <p>  It has been well publicised that NAI would like to fly routes to the United States from Ireland and other European countries and it had hoped to start flying from the airline's base in Barcelona to Cork and onwards to Boston in May this year.

We believe Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in the outcome of the referendum: as a neighbour sharing a land border; as a partner with the UK in transforming British-Irish relations in recent years; and as a facilitator and co-guarantor, with the UK, of successive agreements aimed at securing peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, Ireland will have a clear plan in place to deal with the implications of a UK vote to Leave.</p>  <p>  A framework has been developed on a whole of government basis to identify contingencies that may arise in the days, weeks and months that follow. </p>  <p>  This will be the framework within which each Minister, Department and agency will manage the policy, operational and programmatic implications that could arise from a UK leave vote.  It will be capable of adapting to changing circumstances, depending on developments in the context of ongoing negotiations on new arrangements between the EU and the UK and bilateral discussions between the UK and Irish Governments.</p>  <p>  The plan will clearly identify the Government's priorities and set out a detailed plan of action for communications and diplomatic contact.  It will also take account of how the EU landscape might change in the event of a UK departure and the consequent loss of a key ally with which we share so many priorities including in relation to jobs, growth and investment.  It will consider the possible re-balancing of relationships and priorities within the EU in this context.</p>  <p>  A detailed plan of action for communications and diplomatic contact has also been prepared in the event of a leave result on 24 June.</p>  <p>  Work in this area is being progressed by all Departments in conjunction with key agencies and will cover all areas of Government business.  Dialogue with wider stakeholders including business groups, trade unions and NGOs across all relevant sectors will continue.  Official and diplomatic contact with the UK, other EU Member States and the EU Institutions will be intensified in the event of a leave vote.</p>  <p>  The key priority for Government will be to protect and promote Ireland&rsquo;s key interests in the event that the UK votes to leave.</p>  <p>  Government Departments have scoped the range of risks and opportunities that would fall to be addressed in the two year period following a Leave vote.  This analysis will continue to be deepened in advance of the referendum.</p></reply>

In keeping with normal procedures this will be formalised in a series of Statutory Instruments.  A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive.  I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority to be Chairperson.  At the same time, preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act.  A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations. </p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.  This stage will also include the phased commencement, under the appropriate Statutory Instruments, of the Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.</p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.  It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.</p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority.  This will be provided on a recoupable basis.  As an independent corporate body under statute the new Authority will have the power to manage the conduct of its affairs and its finances.  The annual running cost of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, including the new complaints regime and Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal which will deal with both solicitors and barristers, is estimated at a figure of &euro;4.5 million.  Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  As far as any lobbying may be concerned, there is broad public interest being expressed in general correspondence with my Department in support of the early implementation of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and its package of structural reforms.  This has been conveyed positively with the emphasis to date being on the roll-out of the new legal costs transparency measures, the coming into operation of the new public complaints framework and the commencement of the process for the introduction of pre-action protocols in medical negligence cases.</p>  <p>  In relation to protected disclosure, I very much share the concern of the Deputy that the new legal services regulatory regime be bolstered by robust protected disclosure safeguards.  The Deputy will be aware that the legal services sector-specific measures on protected disclosure, which were in the original Legal Services Regulation Bill as published in 2011, were overtaken by the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act in 2014, which now provides a comprehensive suite of employment and other protections to whistle-blowers who are penalised by their employer or suffer a detriment from a third party on account of raising concerns regarding possible wrongdoing in their workplace.  This is a key pubic interest issue on which there has been detailed consultation between officials of my Department and those of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which leads on policy in this area.  The protection being afforded by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to persons making disclosures under the the new Legal Services Regulation Act will be kept under active review by both Departments to ensure that the Acts are mutually reinforcing.  The underlying objective is, therefore, to provide and to maintain a coherent protected disclosure regime for all concerned under the over-arching Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and to keep it under regular review.</p></reply>

The Act continues to provide a range of possible remedies for debenture holders and lending institutions in the event of a borrower encountering financial difficulties. These include an examinership process, appointment of a receiver and liquidation in those cases in which a company is beyond rescue. The Act includes detailed provisions which regulate the appointment and the powers of examiners, receivers and liquidators respectively. However, the 2014 Act does not specify any regulatory standards for the appointment of a receiver.</p>  <p>  The Company Law Review Group is a statutory body which advises the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the review and development of company law in this jurisdiction. As part of its Work Programme 2014 &ndash; 2016, the Review Group is examining whether it is desirable or necessary to further amend the law in light of developments in case law or any submissions received on matters which have not been addressed in the 2014 Act.</p>  <p>  As regard to the appointment of a receiver to property, the position is that such an appointment may arise under company law or land and conveyancing law: relevant provisions in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 for mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and broadly similar provisions in the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date. Apart from the statutory powers enshrined in the 2009 and 1881 Acts, instruments creating a mortgage usually contains broader contractual terms between the parties in relation to appointment of a receiver and any additional powers which he or she may exercise on appointment. </p>  <p>  Section 108(7) of the 2009 Act, which is based on a broadly similar provision in the 1881 Act, provides that a receiver may retain out of any money received, for remuneration and in satisfaction of all costs incurred as receiver, a commission at the prescribed rate. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 (Section 108) Regulations 2009 - S.I. No. 655 of 2010 - provides that the rate of commission may not exceed five per cent of the gross amount of any money received. This applies in particular in the case of housing loan mortgages. The Companies Act 2014 Act contains provisions concerning the information which must be given on the appointment of a receiver and the manner in which the remuneration of a receiver may be fixed by the Court.</p></reply>

Of these, 42 members were assigned to Granard District and 11 in Edgeworthstown Station. The Deputy may wish to note that the number of members assigned to the Division when the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was at its highest in September 2009 was 299, with 42 members assigned to Granard District and 6 in Edgeworthstown Station.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November. I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 5 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division to date.</p><p>The Programme for Government, &quot;<font color="#2F2F2F">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; commits to</font>continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.

We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years.</p></reply>

Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year. So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November. I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 35 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the DMR South Division to date.</p><p>In relation to the Garda vehicles, since 2012, some &euro;34 million has been invested in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015.  This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis and vehicles are allocated between districts as required by operational circumstances.  In this context, I am advised that the number of vehicles assigned to the Tallaght Garda District is set out in the table overleaf.</p><p>I am further advised by the Commissioner that there are no plans to provide a new station or for major refurbishment works to Tallaght Garda Station at this time.</p><p><b>Garda vehicles assigned to Tallaght Garda District to 10 June 2016</b><table><tr><th>CARS</th><th>CARS</th><th>VANS</th><th>MOTORCYCLES</th><th>4X4</th><th>OTHER</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>MARKED</td><td>UNMARKED</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>36</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Of these 114 are assigned to the Naas District and, while there are currently no Community Garda&iacute; attached to the Naas District, the Commissioner has advised that it is, of course, the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland&mdash;Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.

I welcome in particular, the proposal to establish local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to work with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The CPTs will take proactive measures to prevent crime from happening in the area.  This will entail a combination of crime prevention advice, targeting and disrupting criminals through operations and patrols, and where possible diverting people from committing crime.

The National Director of the IYJS has written to the Garda Commissioner asking that consideration be given to the recommendation having regard to the experience of the existing Diversion Programme, including before it was placed on a statutory footing.  The Commissioner was also asked to consider the issues arising from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's perspective and how the recommendation might best be progressed, having regard to the fact that the existing Diversion Programme for young people under eighteen years of age was already the subject of an ongoing review by a group established by the Commissioner.  I have provided the Deputy with details of the membership of that group and its terms of reference in my reply to question number 137 of today's date.  The Deputy will note that the IYJS is represented on the group.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of the review of the existing Diversion Programme, the outcome of which will assist with the consideration of the Penal Policy Review Group's recommendation, the IYJS and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to consider the detailed implications of implementing the recommendation, including for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for diversionary projects and programmes that may be required to support the operation of a new Diversion Programme.  In this latter regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government states that the Government will support the expansion of Local Drug Taskforce projects and Garda Youth Diversion Programmes for young people promoting restorative justice, and other voluntary organisations that contribute to our young people&rsquo;s future direction.</p></reply>

The following table gives a breakdown of the number of Garda members assigned to each unit. </p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.  The Garda National Drugs Unit works closely with dedicated Divisional and District Drug Units and other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<b><font color="#000080">.</font></b><table><tr><th>Drugs Unit Personnel at 30/04/2016</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Division </td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) Sth.

The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which allows the Bureau to target the proceeds of crime in local communities.  They also assist the Bureau with preparatory groundwork in advance of a full investigation and have recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as at end April 2016, the most recent date for which figures are available, the number of trained Garda Asset Profilers is 200 as well as 15 Revenue Customs and 3 Social Protection trained asset profilers making a total of 218 operating throughout the country.</p></reply>

X-ray scanners are also provided in each closed prison and all hand bags, briefcases, packages, coats etc. are subject to screening.  Stricter searching is carried out on all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence.</p>  <p>  Other security measures include the installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs.  The use of phone detectors and blocking technology, the introduction of hand held metal detectors and the introduction of Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) Chairs are also used to prevent access to contraband in prisons.  The introduction of booked visits, greater use of screened visits, greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison also contribute to preventing the entry of contraband into prisons.</p>  <p>  On 6 July 2015  the Irish Prison Service launched the Irish Prison Service Confidential anti-trafficking telephone line.  The telephone line was introduced to provide Staff, members of the general public and prisoners with a means to call the Prison Service with information about any matter relating to smuggling or attempts at smuggling of prohibited articles such as drugs, weapon and mobile phones. </p></reply>

These are firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms. Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act also includes a statutory obligation on an authorised credit servicing firm not to perform any action that a regulated lender would not be allowed to do. This additional protection seeks to ensure that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale.  </p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, the Central Bank have confirmed that credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Bank that they have:</p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;</p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and</p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. </p></reply>

Changes since then have given people more choices for what to do with their pension savings. This is called the flexible options at retirement regime. These choices include taking a cash payment, subject to income tax, investing in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or investing in an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF).</p>  <p>  Until he or she is 75, a person can only take the whole amount of their savings as cash or put it in an ARF if he or she has a guaranteed pension income of &euro;12,700 or more. If these conditions are not met then he or she can buy an annuity or put a certain amount of the funds, called the "set aside" amount into an AMRF. The maximum "set-aside" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining value of the pension funds, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500. These requirements have been in place since the introduction of the flexible options at retirement regime and are therefore of long standing.</p>  <p>  The funds in an AMRF can be used at any time, in full or in part, to buy an annuity. This includes the option to buy an annuity which is large enough to give the owner a guaranteed income of &euro;12,700. If the owner does this he or she will then have access to the rest of the funds, as their AMRF can then be converted into an ARF with discretionary access to the funds, subject to tax at their marginal rate.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that a person without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "safety net" to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement. However, every year to age 75, the owner of an AMRF can access 4% of the funds in the AMRF.</p>  <p>  If an individual meets the requirements to be able to access the full amount of the funds in an AMRF (on conversion to an ARF) and chooses to do so then it is taxable in the hands of the recipient as income for the tax year in which it is paid.</p></reply>

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes including the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code which is being replaced by the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which comes into operation on 1 July 2016.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.  Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.</p></reply>

These sections are replacements for the existing general anti-avoidance rule contained in sections 811 and 811A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The new provisions reformed and simplified the arrangements Revenue have to follow in order to challenge a transaction as a tax avoidance transaction. The general principles as to what constituted a tax avoidance transaction remain, broadly, the same under both sets of provisions. </p><p>Sections 811C and 811D apply to transactions commenced after 23 October 2014. The provisions of sections 811 and 811A continue to apply to transactions commenced before that date.</p><p>At this stage, the provisions of sections 811C and 811D have not been applied by Revenue. The reason for this is that tax returns based on avoidance transactions covered by the new provisions will only start to be filed on or after 31 October 2016. There is, theoretically, a very small possibility of a transaction started and finished in the period 23 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 being reflected in a tax return filed on or after 31 October 2015 but the likelihood of this is small.</p><p>In any event, the filing of a tax return that reflects an underlying tax avoidance transaction (the tax avoidance transaction itself is not described in the return) is only the start of a process of challenging such a transaction. Once an underlying transaction is identified, it must be thoroughly investigated and all relevant facts (commercial, legal and contractual) relating to the transaction established. Once these facts are established the transaction in its entirety needs to be analysed to establish the precise tax provisions that are being abused or misused. Only at this stage, a process which can take some time, would Revenue be in a position to challenge the transactions under the new rules by issuing tax avoidance assessments under section 811C.</p><p>While tax and interest must be paid once a transaction is found to be a tax avoidance transaction under the general anti-avoidance rule, civil tax penalties, as such, do not apply. Instead, a tax avoidance surcharge of 30 per cent of the tax avoided applies in avoidance cases. This surcharge may be reduced if a taxpayer agrees a settlement at an early stage of the process. Tax, interest and the tax avoidance surcharge applies under both the new and old anti-avoidance provisions, but it should be noted that in the case of transactions commenced before February 2006 only the tax avoided is payable where a transaction is found to be a tax avoidance transaction.  <b></b></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no criminal tax offences involving tax avoidance that can be subject to criminal prosecutions.</p><p>It should be noted that 452 cases under the general anti-avoidance legislation covering a potential of &euro;168 million in tax are being actively managed currently.</p></reply>

While it is under the aegis of my Department, it is a fully independent voice that assesses the fiscal stance and assesses compliance with fiscal rules that Ireland signed up to under both the Stability and Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact. In accordance with the "two-pack" EU regulations, an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013 assigned the function of endorsing, as it considers appropriate, the macroeconomic forecasts produced by my Department to the Fiscal Council. </p>  <p>  The Council publishes two Fiscal Assessment Reports each year, following the Budget in the Autumn and the Stability Programme Update in the Spring. The reports assess the Government's macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, the appropriateness of the fiscal stance, compliance with the budgetary rule, as well as detailing the Council's endorsement function. Following consideration of these reports by my officials and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I respond publically to each Fiscal Assessment Report. While it is the case that I do not always share the Council's analysis in the Fiscal Assessment Reports, I very much value their expertise and their input as an independent voice in helping the Government to adhere to its own fiscal targets. </p>  <p>  There are five members of the Council, including the Chair, and I have a role in appointing the members. In accordance with the "Guidelines for appointments to state boards" published by the Government in November 2014, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) manages an open selection process when a vacancy exists on the Board.  Part of the open selection process involves a PAS-appointed advisory panel recommending candidates for appointment that are deemed to meet the published selection criteria.  A list of these candidates is then submitted by the PAS for my consideration, following which I make an appointment to the Fiscal Council in accordance with the legislation. </p>  <p>  Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, I approve the numbers of staff and their terms and conditions after consulting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department facilitates the funding of the Council from the Central Fund in accordance with the Act.  The Fiscal Council is required to give a copy of their annual accounts and their annual report to me each year and I am required under the Act to lay these before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also have the power to appoint a person to examine the accounts of the Fiscal Council but this has not been needed to date.</p>  <p>  I value the Fiscal Council's important role as an independent watchdog and, as indicated above, my interaction with the Council is only as required by its legislatively-mandated role.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-14a.309.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400063#WRE04300"><p>Firstly, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called "ARF option"), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum "set aside" amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF) or purchase an annuity with those funds.</p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) with access to those funds at the owner's discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements).</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed pension income requirement from &euro;12,700 per annum to an amount equal to 1.5 times the State Pension (Contributory) which at that time would have amounted to &euro;18,000 per annum. That Act also increased the maximum "set-aside" amount required to be placed in an AMRF from &euro;63,500 to an amount equivalent to 10 times the State Pension (Contributory) which at that time would have amounted to &euro;118,900.  In Finance Act 2013, I decided to rescind those increases and to return the pension income requirement and the "set-aside" requirement to their original levels (&euro;12,700 and &euro;63,500, respectively). Finance Act 2013 also included provisions to ensure that individuals impacted by the higher limits introduced by Finance Act 2011 were not disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2014, I introduced changes to allow owners of AMRFs to draw-down up to 4% of the value of the assets in such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied prior to the changes. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "nest-egg" to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or met the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to the Finance Act 2014 changes, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. </p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. </p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. </p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a drawdown of a lesser value than will now be permitted. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time for further changes to the legislation dealing with AMRFs. </p></reply>

This 30% rate is scheduled to apply to these first-time buyers for the remaining years that mortgage interest relief continues to be available.  In the absence of this change the mortgage interest relief available would have gradually reduced to a rate of 15%.</p>  <p>  Single individuals, married couples and civil partners that are first-time buyers, qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum interest ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively.  Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.   Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals for whom repayments against principal make up a growing proportion of the overall repayment, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner.  In addition, as the amount of interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem. </p>  <p>  In the Programme for a Partnership Government there is a commitment to retain mortgage interest relief beyond the current end date of December 2017 on a tapered basis.  The Deputy will note that the current end date is December 2017 and I will consider options for such tapering in due course. </p></reply>

The review group confirmed that a central feature of apprenticeship should continue to be that there is a requirement participants to be employed with an approved employer prior to registration as an apprentice.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development, with employers on a number of these new apprenticeships planning to recruit in 2016.  Some of these apprenticeships will be suitable for young people entering the labour market for the first time and the Council is working with partners to ensure that information on these opportunities is made available as widely as possible.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the vast majority of primary school buildings in the country are in private ownership, including the school referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  The Department has a general policy of encouraging the use of school facilities by community and other groups where this is possible. However, any proposal for the use of school facilities must be approved by the Patron/owner.  I understand that the Patron/owner has not granted approval for the operation of a pre-school on the premises in question. </p><p>  In 2005, the Department issued a circular to Trustees, Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Voluntary Secondary Schools (Circular Letter Prim 16/05) to encourage Trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community, education and recreation purposes. This circular recognises that the decision ultimately lies with the relevant Board or Trustees and that the first priority at all times should be the interest of the school, its teachers and pupils.</p></reply>

Changing the patronage of primary schools should not therefore impact on the day to day running costs of schools or their method of funding.</p><p>  Primary schools are funded on a capitation based system.  There is a standard capitation rate for all primary schools of &euro;170 per pupil subject to a minimum payment of &euro;10,200 for small schools of less than 60 pupils. </p><p>  There are 9 model schools that vary in size.  The cost of running the 9 model schools are dealt with on the basis of vouched expenditure under a budget based system.  These costs can vary from school to school and from year to year depending on the needs of the school at that time.  It would therefore be difficult to make an accurate comparison between the vouched expenditure and budget based system in the 9 model schools and the capitation based system in operation for all other primary schools.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its May meeting which was refused.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  Based on its enrolment on 30th September 2015, the school will have a mainstream staffing of Administrative Principal and 6 classroom teachers for the 2016/17 school year, the same as the current year's staffing.  The staffing schedule allows for a pupil teacher ratio of 22:1 for DEIS Urban Band 1 schools with classes from infants through to 6th class, such as the school referred to by the Deputy.  In its appeal, the school projected an enrolment of 125 for September 2016 which will mean the pupil teacher ratio in the school will be less than 21 students to every mainstream classroom teacher.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). </p></reply>

The Charter is an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, working in association with the Arts Council.  I am delighted to report progress on the Charter objectives as follows. </p>  <p>  A Charter Implementation group under the chairmanship of Professor John Coolahan was appointed oversee the implementation of the Charter objectives and report on its progress.</p>  <p>  The Arts in Education Portal: Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland, was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch up to the end of March, there have been 18,145 visitors (per session) with 43,295 page views, an average of nearly 4,000 page views per month.  A celebration and demonstration of the success of the Portal formed part of the National Arts in Education Day, held at The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) on 23rd April 2016.</p>  <p>  Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative:  A major new development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation, in 2014, by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, "Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education" commenced in the summer of 2014 will be launched shortly. It is intended that each of the 21 Education Centres will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future through strategic planning involving collaboration and co-operation with the various Local Authority Arts Offices, art organisations, educational institutions and school communities.</p>  <p>  Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.  Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions has been a major boost to this work.</p>  <p>  Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines, were originally published in 2006.  A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education: www.artsineducation.ie.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.</p>  <p>  Nationwide Mapping of Arts Provision, Relevant to Education: Planning is underway to incorporate a mapping of organisations, events, artists and locations at regional and local level throughout the country, which could be drawn upon for arts-in-education purposes.  This will be incorporated in the Arts-In-Education Portal on an incremental basis.  This could be a major resource for schools, and also help to highlight areas of limited or poor provision, with a view to its remediation. </p>  <p>  ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, and the Department of Education and Skills, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; "ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community." A working group has been established and is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s.  The working group is working to develop a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).</p>  <p>  Research in Arts in Education: The Arts in Education Charter refers to the need for access to research that builds on existing good practice and explores new models of arts and school practice to create a source of knowledge and experience for policy makers and practitioners to draw on.  The Implementation Group has had communications with the Higher Education Authority, higher education institutions and associated bodies on how best a repository of such research can be established as an on-going source of such provision.  Discussions are still underway with the aim that such a National Digital Research Repository for Arts in Education would be established over the next 18 months. </p>  <p>  Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office.  Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people. In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020.50% of the initial funding for Phase 1 of this initiative came from philanthropic sources and the remaining 50% funding was from MEPs.  After 3 years, the Exchequer took up 50% funding as the philanthropic funding were phased out. Phase 2 will similarly funded.</p>  <p>  Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme 2016: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016 worth &euro;50,000.  The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way a cash grant, to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding.</p>  <p>  Local Arts Education Partnership (LAEPs): An objective of the Arts in Education Charter which will make a major contribution to rooting arts in education at local and regional level as normative provision, is the Local Arts Education Partnerships (LAEPs).  The impact of co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the ETBs, in conjunction with the regional Teacher Education Centres and other agencies, have potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision in Ireland to the great benefit of young people throughout the country.</p>  <p>  School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.</p></reply>

At that time there were negotiations on the reconstitution of Boards of Management of primary schools.  It was agreed that patrons would no longer nominate a majority of the members of a Board of Management. In return, it was agreed that Deeds of Variation would be put in place to vary the Charging Leases/Declarations of Trust.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing.</p>  <p>  The commitment given by the school patrons in 1997 to cede majority representation on Boards of Management was implemented.  Hence the engagement by officials in the Department in the interim in relation to agreeing a form of words for the Deeds of Variation represents a recognition of the original commitment given to the school patrons at that time. </p></reply>

A follow-up paper to the Forum Report entitled &quot;Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions&quot; was published in July 2014.  This paper outlined the progress made to date on implementing the Forum's recommendations with a particular focus on the issue of inclusion and diversity in schools. </p><p>  It is my view that the desire of parents for diversity in education choice can be provided effectively by focussing on the delivery of the ambition to treble the number of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools as set out in the Programme for Government.  This commitment is to deliver a total of 400 non-denominational and multi-denominational schools by 2030. </p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which was published in April 2015 did not progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas and was not reinstated for the current D&aacute;il session. However, I have commenced a process of consultation with opposition parties to discuss my proposals to introduce a new Admissions Bill to make the process of enrolling children in school easier for parents. </p><p>  Following these consultations, it is my intention to publish a new Admissions Bill during the current D&aacute;il session.</p><p>  It is important to note that the new Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.  </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2015. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2016 has made provision for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools for the 2016/17 school year.  At primary level, these posts will be used to provide an improvement to the staffing schedule, along with providing an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.  There will be a one point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for the 2016/17 school year.  This will see the schedule operate on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 27 pupils, rather than the current 28.</p><p>  Based on the 2016/17 staffing schedule, the school referred to by the Deputy will have a mainstream teaching post suppressed for the 2016/17 school year due to falling enrolments.  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  My Department has not received a staffing appeal from the school referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p></reply>

For planning purposes, my Department uses school planning areas, of which there are 314 nationwide, including some 40 in Dublin.  Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, has its own school planning area, as does Lucan and Clondalkin.  Inchicore is included in the Dublin 8 school planning area.  </p><p>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the school planning areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my own Department's databases.  With this information, nationwide demographic exercises are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p><p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the new school.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons, including Irish-medium education providers, to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p><p>  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018 to meet demographic needs was announced.  All school planning areas, including the Ballyfermot area are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to schools in this, and adjacent, areas. </p></reply>

However, neither I nor my Department has any direct role in monitoring or supervising the delivery of water services or any pollution incidents arising therefrom. </p><p>Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels for public water services, including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure, encompassing the management of urban waste water collection and treatment infrastructure.  All discharges to the aquatic environment from sewerage systems owned, managed and operated by Irish Water require a waste water discharge licence or certificate of authorisation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled.</p><p>The EPA is a key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges.  Details of all prosecutions taken by the EPA for pollution incidents and details of its enforcement activities are published on the EPA&rsquo;s website ().</p><p>Referring to the specific issue at Doldrum Bay, I understand that Irish Water has carried out investigative works in order to develop an effective solution to the untreated sewage discharge there.  An initial survey was completed in late 2015 and an options report is now under consideration by Irish Water.  Any long-term solution to the problem is likely to take some years to put in place between design, planning and construction.  The EPA has accordingly asked Irish Water to set out potential measures to be put in place in the interim to address any public health issues arising.</p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s Bathing Water Report for 2015 identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas, particularly those in and around Dublin Bay, as being prone to episodic pollution events and being of less than &lsquo;Good&rsquo; water quality status.  These pollution events are generally associated with overflows from pumping stations or storm outfalls as a result of sewer network blockages or following heavy rainfall.  The EPA report highlights the remedial works planned by Irish Water in relation to Loughshinny and Rush and significant infrastructural investment will be required to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of pollution events in these urban areas.</p><p>The imposition of bathing prohibitions by local authorities in the event of discharges or following intense localised rainfall is done with regard to public health on a precautionary principle.  All such incidents are reported to the EPA&rsquo;s wastewater enforcement system and are publicised on the SPLASH website at which is the national bathing water information website for identified bathing waters around Ireland.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in Co Donegal and has replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department over the last decade or so.  The following towns in County Donegal are now served by modern fire stations with full facilities: Millford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An Fal Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal Town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Clochan Liath, Glenties and Moville (all in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009).  My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years and as a consequence, the high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure is now widely acknowledged.</p>  <p>  My Department recently announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on the current annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres.  Under this programme, local authorities will bring forward sixteen new-build fire station projects and ten fire stations are to be upgraded.  The projects in the capital programme will be reassessed on an annual basis and priority may be adjusted to bring forward projects offering best value-for-money and to take account of the state of readiness of the projects.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of a new fire station in Ballyshannon, this issue has been the subject of discussions with the Local Authority for a number of years.  While this station is not included in the programme, my Department is liaising with Donegal County Council to look at possibilities for advancing a project in the south of the county, taking into account, among other issues, site suitability, fire cover requirements and prioritisation of projects.</p>  <p>  In further considering any proposal, my Department will have regard to established national priorities for funding in this area and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide.  The priorities of Donegal County Council, the extent of current and previous investment in Donegal Fire services and the status of existing facilities, having regard to area risk categorisation, will also be considered.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p><p>The legislation requires that from 1 July 2016 , the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected.  The Government has set a <i>minimum</i>mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11c for black bin (residual waste) and 6c for brown bin (food/organic waste), while a zero cent <i>minimum</i>fee per kilogramme may be set for green bins (recyclate).  The per kilogram minimum charge was designed to cover the minimum cost of treating the waste collected after it has been deposited by the collector at their depot or a waste transfer station to its final treatment, whether that be at a landfill, incinerator or other treatment method.  This helps ensure that the polluter pays principle is applied in the pricing structure and that the collector has charged at least enough to cover the cost of treating the waste, thus helping to ensure it will be treated properly.  A service fee may also be charged by the collector.</p><p>Under pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In an open market, it has been, and will continue to be, a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.  Excessive pricing by individual companies will offer the opportunity for rival operators to provide their services at a cheaper price.</p><p>Finally, the landfill levy has proven to be a huge incentive to divert waste from landfill and to encourage the recycling and recovery of materials.  The current rate of the landfill levy is &euro;75 per tonne which encourages operators to find alternative treatment options for waste, including household waste.

In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for data regarding inspections, I have no role or function in relation to the inspection of building sites or the assignment of personnel for the inspection of building sites.  These are matters for local authorities, who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.  The Local Government Management Agency collected data on inspections carried out on buildings and published it in the <i>Service Indicators in Local Authorities </i>reports from 2005 to 2013.  These reports are available at .</p><p>Following the commencement of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the National Oversight &amp;amp; Audit Commission (NOAC) now collect and publish this data.  The <i>Performance Indicators in Local Authorities 2014 </i>report is available at .</p><p>I can advise the Deputy that in tandem with the commencement of the , the online Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed to provide a common platform for the clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  Its purpose is to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their separate responsibilities under the Building Control Acts.  Oversight of construction activity by local building control authorities has now improved immeasurably with the availability and ready access to detailed data on projects via the online BCMS.</p><p>In addition, <i>A Framework for Building Control Authorities</i>was adopted by the City and County Management Association in July 2014 in order to standardise work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to the oversight of building control activity across the local authority sector, to enhance consistency of approach nationally, and to move towards a risk-based approach to inspections by building control authorities.  Standardised inspection templates have also been developed under this process.</p><p>These key reforms to the building control framework represent a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector now and into the future.  Nevertheless, my Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, industry stakeholders and members of the public generally to ensure that all concerned understand their obligations under the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.  While fees for professional services are determined by market forces and are therefore outside the scope of my regulatory powers, as part of last year&rsquo;s review of the first twelve months of the operation of the regulations, my Department prepared a <i>Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan for a Single Unit Dwelling on a Single Development</i>in order to identify the key stages that would require inspection during the construction of a single unit dwelling on a single development and to estimate the costs associated with such an inspection plan.</p><p>The cost calculations published to accompany the Sample Preliminary Inspection Plan demonstrated that the Assigned Certifier role could be achieved at an approximate cost of &euro;3,800 inclusive of VAT.  Where additional design work is required the combined cost of assigned certifier duties and additional design work will be of the order of &euro;6,000 inclusive of VAT.  These costs relate to the implementation of the inspection plan on a single non-complex dwelling; for example, the costs associated with multi-units dwellings, such as apartments, may be lower due to economies of scale.  A copy of this plan and all other documents released as part of that public consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>During the public consultation, a number of respondents confirmed that the assigned certifier services could be secured in line with the Department&rsquo;s estimates.</p><p>Following the review, the owners of one-off houses were given the facility to opt<b></b>out of statutory certification from 1 September 2015, under the<b></b>.</p><p>I am satisfied that these revised arrangements address concerns with regard to the impact of statutory certification on new single dwellings.  It is clear from the review that the recent reforms have brought a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  In this regard, I am confident that as the transition to the new arrangements for the control of building activity continues to progress, these reforms will in time prove capable of transforming the culture of the construction industry in Ireland to one of improved compliance and quality.</p><p>In general terms, the cost of delivering housing is dependent on a wide range of factors such as construction costs, land cost, financing costs etc.  In this regard, the costs associated with assigned certifier services are far from the most significant element of the overall costs of delivering houses to the market.  However, in accordance with the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, my Department is preparing a new <i>Action Plan for Housing</i>and will continue to liaise closely with other Departments and agencies as well as with industry stakeholders with a view to identifying any reasonable and appropriate measures that may be taken in the interests of reducing construction overheads to facilitate an increased level of housing output.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-14a.537.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400067#WRJ03600"><p>My Department, together with the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency and local authorities, has considered the affordability issues facing some borrowers who purchased properties under the Shared Ownership (SO) schemes and devised a more affordable long-term path towards full home ownership.  A range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.</p><p>The Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.</p><p>In addition, the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate was cut by 0.20% and this has helped many Share Ownership borrowers.  The rate cut brought the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers down to 2.55% with effect from 1 July 2015, saving borrowers around &euro;17 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.  A further rate cut of 0.25% will take effect from 1 July 2016, saving borrowers around &euro; 21 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.  The variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers will then stand at 2. 30 %.</p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option involves rolling-up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance; rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood.  The restructuring option can lead to full homeownership for the borrower and as such allows for up or down sizing to suit household needs.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their Rental Equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each SO borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  Local authorities are currently contacting SO borrowers for whom the restructuring option is deemed appropriate.  In some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.</p><p>Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.  Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is avail able on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p></reply>

Security of tenure under the Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.</p><p>A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  These grounds include that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, that the landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling, and that the landlord requires the dwelling for a family member.</p><p>Amendments introduced in the <b>Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 </b>further strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that will guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.</p><p>In addition, the 2015 Act introduced further graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days&rsquo; notice for tenancies of 8 years or more.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a specific commitment to review the regulatory regime for the rented sector to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights, interests and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p></reply>

In relation to rent stability, the Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced.  Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.</p><p>Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include: </p><p>- that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area; </p><p>- that notification of a rent increase to the RTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by the tenant that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews.</p><p>The rental market in Ireland has grown significantly in recent years and now accounts for around 20% of total Irish households.  In Dublin rents are now back to 2007 peak boom-time levels.  The most recent RTB rent index shows that in the first quarter of 2016, rents were 8.6 % higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2015.  Data for Q1 2016 show that rents have continued to increase, although the rate of growth slowed in most sectors in the first quarter.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through increasing the supply of housing.  Housing is an absolute priority for this Government and, accordingly, a key priority of the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>is the preparation and publication of an &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing&rsquo; within the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days.  The Action Plan will be drafted with input from a number of key Departments, and will draw on the work of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which is due to submit a final report to the D&aacute;il by 17 June 2016.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-14a.549.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400067#WRJ04800"><p>Government waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy as set out in the EU&rsquo;s Waste Framework Directive.  A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.  Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.</p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>  <p>  However, under pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard, a pay-by-weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, is being rolled out at national, regional and local levels over the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by-weight charging.</p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA-Mortgage-to-Rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-Mortgage-to-Rent).  Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p><p>Information in relation to Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme applications during its pilot phase in Dublin City Council and Westmeath County Council in 2013 and following national roll out of the scheme in 2014 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; .</p><p>Local authorities are responsible for submitting valid LAMTR applications to my Department and all applications received were approved.</p><p>To date in 2016, 3 LAMTR cases have been received and approved for Dublin City Council and 1 claim has been received from Kilkenny County Council and is being processed by my Department.  The Department&rsquo;s deadline for receipt of the next tranche of funding claims from local authorities is 31July 2016.</p><p>In relation to activity under the AHB Mortgage to Rent scheme, at the end of April 2016, a total of 162 cases have been completed, 18 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and 645 are actively being progressed.  The following tables give the breakdown by Local Authority and by AHB.</p><p>In total, since the introduction of the scheme in 2012, 3,313 cases had been submitted.  There are a variety of reasons why cases have not progressed including the householder&rsquo;s circumstances improving during the process, no social housing demand in the area, the householder&rsquo;s income being in excess of the statutory limits for eligibility for social housing, and poor condition of the property.  My Department continues to work together with the agencies involved with the scheme including lenders, to streamline the administrative process and ensure that all potential cases are dealt with speedily and efficiently.</p><p>In addition, the package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015, included a number of amendments to the Mortgage to Rent scheme, which will enable more properties to qualify, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Amendments made with effect from July 2015 include raising the valuation thresholds for properties, flexibility in relation to the size of properties, more efficient assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support and flexibility to allow cases of marginal positive equity to avail of the scheme.  Additional financial support has been made available by increasing the ceiling of support under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) for MTR cases from 30% to 40%.</p><p><b></b><b>Table 2 Number of AHB Mortgage to Rent cases completed by AHB</b><b>from commencement</b><b>from commencement of scheme</b><b>to end April 2016</b><table><tr><th><div>Organisation </div></th><th>Number of Completed Cases </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council </td><td><div>5 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council </td><td><div>3 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council </td><td><div>3 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council </td><td><div>6 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council </td><td><div>4 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council </td><td><div>  0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td><div>25 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td><div>13 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council </td><td><div>8 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council </td><td><div>6 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td><div>3 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City and County Council </td><td><div>6 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council </td><td><div>1 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td><div>16 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td><div>  0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council </td><td><div>15 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council </td><td><div>  0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td><div>5 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council </td><td><div>  0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td><div>  0 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td><div>11 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council </td><td><div>7 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City and County Council </td><td><div>10 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td><div>2 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council </td><td><div>4 </div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>162 </div></td></tr></table><table><tr><th><div>AHB_Name </div></th><th>Number of completed cases </th></tr><tr><td>Cl&uacute;id Housing Association </td><td><div>106 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North and East Housing Association </td><td><div>4 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Oaklee Housing Trust </td><td><div>36 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Respond!

However, the 2012 <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government, Putting People First</i>indicated that it would also be reasonable to anticipate that overall savings to local authorities in the range &euro;15 to &euro;20 million per annum relative to 2010 expenditure figures would be achievable from sub-county reorganisation when the reformed structures, including the establishment of municipal districts, had bedded down.</p><p>Municipal districts now cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lacked any sub-county governance.  As well as creating a more rational and comprehensive structural arrangement, the new system enables more effective and community-focused decision making and implementation.  Under the new arrangements, there is full integration of local authority resources across each county and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.</p><p>In 2015, which was the first full year of the revised local government structures, a broadly based Advisory Group was convened to carry out a review of their operation, in conjunction with a Local Government Forum for engagement with the Association of Irish Local Government.  Feedback from these deliberations and the results of surveys of local authority members and chief executives, indicate that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  The results of this operational review will provide a key input to the consideration of issues in the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017, pursuant to the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issue of town or borough council status.</p></reply>

The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>contains a commitment for the introduction of a new model of affordable rental to provide more housing options for low income households and to relieve pressure on the social housing sector.  &euro;10 million is being made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to fund a pilot scheme in 2016.  The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department for roll-out in the coming months.  The Scheme will be an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.</p><p>The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges.  Such a scheme would also be expected to facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.</p><p>The inadequate level of housing supply is at the heart of the difficulties in the housing sector and, in that regard, measures have already been taken to boost new housing construction and enhance supply at more affordable prices.  The &ldquo;<i>Stabilising Rents &ndash; Boosting Supply</i>&rdquo; package announced by Government in November 2015 included:</p><p>- A targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels to enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations;</p><p>- New National Apartment Planning Guidelines to reduce the cost of apartment building in Dublin City, </p><p>- Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements; and,</p><p>- The Government&rsquo;s Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to examine funding for housing infrastructure on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The package also included a number of measures to support rent stability in the rented sector, pending additional housing supply coming on stream in the coming years.</p><p>Further actions aimed at increasing the supply of housing at more affordable prices are being examined in the context of drafting the Government&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing,&rsquo; which is to be published within the Government&rsquo;s first 100 days.</p></reply>

The commitment in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides a platform to consolidate and build on the significant work to date, and will ensure that momentum is sustained in future housing policy development.  <i>The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2011-2016</i>and the associated <i>National Implementation Framework</i>are joint publications by my Department and the Department of Health, and set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities.  They were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy and Congregated Settings Report.  It is intended that the current Strategy will be extended beyond its original timeframe of 2016 to continue to deliver on its aims.</p><p>A dedicated Housing Subgroup, chaired by the Housing Agency, was established in 2012 to progress implementation and <i>includes representatives from my Department, the HSE, the Department of Health, local authorities, the Irish Council for Social Housing and various disability representative organisations.  The Housing Agency sub-group is progressing a range of priority actions within an agreed work plan.  Much work has been done to deliver on various initiatives and this will continue.</i></p><p>An Implementation Monitoring Group (IMG) was established to monitor and report on progress.  The IMG is chaired by a senior official of my Department and comprises representatives from the HSE, the National Disability Authority, National Service Users Executive and disability representative organisations.  The first progress report of the IMG was published in 2014 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>The Monitoring Group is preparing a second progress report for the period 2014/2015 which will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when finalised this Autumn.</p><p><i>National Guidelines for the Assessment and Allocation Process for Housing Provision for People with a Disability</i>were developed and adopted for implementation by housing authorities with effect from November 2014.  Also, housing authorities have established Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs), chaired by each authority and including the HSE and disability representative organisations, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities at a local level.  A Strategic Plan for each county/city area has been drawn up by the HDSGs to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging needs.  The local Strategic Plans are currently being collated by the Housing Agency into a draft National Plan. </p><p><i>Implementation of the Congregated Settings Report, led by the HSE, is supported by my Department through the NHSPWD. My Department is represented on the HSE Working Group and is supporting the ongoing work to progress the transitioning of individuals from congregated settings, including the provision of &euro;10 million ring-fenced funding in 2016 under the Capital Assistance Scheme to assist the Department of Health and the HSE in accelerating the Government&rsquo;s deinstitutionalisation programme.  This is additional to capital funding which is being provided separately by the Minister for Health.</i></p><p><i>Funding is also provided by my Department to local authorities towards the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability.  The funding allocation of &euro;56.25 million in 2016 for the Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme represents an increase of some 10% in funding provided in 2015 under this Scheme and comprises &euro;45 million exchequer funding and &euro;11.25 million local authority funding.  Under this Scheme, people with a disability can have necessary repairs or improvement works carried out to their homes in order to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their homes.  I am conscious of the social benefit accruing from this Scheme in terms of facilitating the continued independent living by people with a disability in their own homes and therefore, in line with the </i><i><i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i></i><i>, further consideration will be given to increasing this funding over the coming years.</i></p><p>The concept of Universal Design centres on achieving a built environment that can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size or disability.  All new buildings, including social housing units must comply with the legally enforceable minimum performance standards set out in the <i>Building Regulations 1997 - 2014</i>.  In this context, the <i>Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010</i>, and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use</i>(2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings, and to existing buildings where new works, a material alteration or a material change of use is proposed.</p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability: </p><p>(a) new buildings other than dwellings (including multi-unit developments) are accessible and usable; </p><p>(b) extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable; </p><p>(c) material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; </p><p>(d) certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; and </p><p>(e) new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.  While the latest iteration of Part M of the Building Regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment will now be seen more widely as economic recovery takes hold and construction activity begins to gather momentum and moves onto a sustainable footing.  Building Regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to on-going review in the interests of safety and well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of technological progress and innovation.</p></reply>

The scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 January 2014, with customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 retaining entitlement until the closure of the scheme on 1st January 2018. </p>  <p>  The continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist families in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem.  The most appropriate way in which families experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.</p>  <p>  It is expected that over the remaining period existing customers will exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  My Department is also considering referral of cases to the Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS (DMA MABS) service.  This service is focused on post-MARP cases and has been established across 26 locations assisting mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable option, and where required, negotiating with the lender on the client&rsquo;s behalf. </p>  <p>  Together with the Insolvency Service of Ireland, MABS has established a national network of Court Mentors to attend relevant Courts nationwide, where repossessions hearings are listed, to provide support to distressed borrowers and direct them to the appropriate services which can provide them with the necessary help and assistance. </p>  <p>  It is my view that these are appropriate measures to assist people experiencing mortgage arrears on their homes and guidance has recently issued to the Department&rsquo;s staff in the Community Welfare Service to inform persons experiencing financial difficulty of these additional supports.</p></reply>

Given the urgency of the housing crisis, this Cabinet Committee is meeting on a weekly basis which I attend.  Officials from my Department are also represented on the Homelessness Policy Implementation Team led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) to oversee the implementation of the Homelessness Action Plan.  Department officials at local level are actively engaged with relevant local authorities, Homeless Action Teams, Regional teams and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the necessary supports are provided.  Overall the response to the current extremely difficult housing situation has to be multifaceted and I am satisfied with the input that my Department is providing to the overall housing strategy.  This level of inter-agency participation ensures greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness and related services.  </p><p>The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of DHPLG.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas with payments being made in respect of some 10,180 tenancies.  The funding for the rent supplement scheme in 2015 and 2016 represents a transfer of funding to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for HAP scheme of over &euro;20 million in 2015 and &euro;24 million in 2016 (cumulative transfer of over &euro;64 million during the last 2 years).  Funding arrangements for 2017 will be considered having regard to the costs of rent supplement, rate of roll out of HAP and projected transfers.  Where HAP is in operation this Department will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment.  </p><p>My Department is currently examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment to provide for an increase taking account of geographic variations in market rents.  It is my intention that increased rent limits will be implemented over the summer months, ahead of budget 2017, subject to agreement by Government.  Analysis shows that increasing rent limits by 10% would result in a full year cost of approximately &euro;32 million. </p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,540 households are supported through this flexible approach.  A county breakdown of this information is provided in the tabular statement below. </p><p>The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute.  Following engagement with the relevant agencies this protocol was recently extended to the commuter counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, and to Galway City.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has identified expanding this Protocol nationwide, and the Department will continue to work with colleagues in DHPLG, local authorities and Threshold to support this extension.  </p><p>Landlords are continuing to provide accommodation to persons under the rent supplement scheme with over 5,800 tenancies awarded this year.  A breakdown of this information on a county basis is also provided in the following tabular statements.</p><p>I would urge that any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy under rent supplement to contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or the Threshold Tenancy Protection service without delay. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Rent

The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.7% in Q1 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 56.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q1 2016 was 100,600; this compares to 156,200 in Q1 2014.</p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate long-term unemployed  people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016). </p>  <p>  A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for  long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.  I am satisfied these measures will continue to contribute to addressing long-term unemployment.</p></reply>

This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).</p>  <p>  As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee as envisaged in the relevant EU Recommendation, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed.  The objective is to ensure that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.</p>  <p>  The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be provided, both through reserved places on existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied these measures will help to address youth unemployment.</p></reply>

As of 13th June 2016, a total of 890,036 grant applications had been submitted by householders and processed. </p>  <p>  The administration and payment of this grant was a significant project requiring the development and implementation of ICT systems, ICT infrastructure and various customer support and communications services.  The total administration costs for the 2015 Water Conservation Grant to date are &euro;5,995,035.42.  These include both the once-off setup costs and the operational costs.  A small number of residual payments continue to be made to householders who have an entitlement to the 2015 Water Conservation Grant.  As a result, some comparatively small operational costs continue to be incurred and the final administrative cost has yet to be finalised.</p>  <p>  All costs connected with the set-up and administration of the Water Conservation Grant are being recouped from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in line with existing procedures.  Every effort is being made to maximise efficiencies and keep costs to the absolute minimum.  Where possible, the Department reused existing payment production systems to facilitate payment of the grant.  It is also intended that the ICT infrastructure put in place for this project will be reused for the provision of online services in the future.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

EmployAbility participants are people with a disability, which can range from physical to mental health, who are able to work a minimum of 8 hours per week and who need the support of a job coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  The duration of the service is 18 months.  The budget for 2016 provides &euro;9.6 million to run the service.</p>  <p>  The EmployAbility service currently comprises 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit, so the demand for the service varies from region to region.  Data from 2015 shows that the average number of weeks that a person was waiting for a place on the service was 10 weeks.</p>  <p>  The data requested by the Deputy in relation to persons without a disability are not collected by my Department.  The Department&rsquo;s mainstream employment support service is provided through Intreo, which delivers a personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  Persons on disability payments can avail of this service on a voluntary basis, where they may be referred to the EmployAbility service where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The average cost of providing support through the EmployAbility service is &euro;2,900 per customer, so if the service was expanded to support an additional 1,000 customers, the estimated additional annual cost would be &euro;2.9 million.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

JobPath is one of a range of activation supports, including schemes such as Community Employment, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.</p>  <p>  The person concerned has been in receipt of a jobseeker payment for a number of years and has not had any meaningful activation engagement.

Job-seekers are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.

Participation in other schemes and programmes remains an option once the client&rsquo;s period on JobPath is completed.</p>  <p>  In the case in question I understand that the person concerned has completed a personal progression plan and that her personal advisor is actively working with her to assist her in finding suitable full-time employment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise when the application form is not competed fully or supporting documentation is not provided at claim stage or where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into my Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in the form of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary welfare payments.  In April 2016, the average number of weeks taken to process a jobseeker's allowance application was 2 and a jobseeker's benefit claim was 1.</p><p>Disability allowance applications were processed in an average of 10 weeks in April 2016.</p><p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-tested schemes, are experiencing delays presently, averaging 20 weeks in April 2016.  Delays are also occurring in domiciliary care allowance, where claims were processed in an average of 13 weeks in April. This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to all three of these schemes and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is sometimes a reluctance on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by an Departmental investigative officer.  </p><p>The social welfare appeals office has supplied details in tabular form as follows of the processing time across all scheme types in 2016 up to the end of May.</p><p>Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. </p><p>In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal processing times by scheme 01/01/2016 &ndash; 31/05/2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th><div>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</div></th><th><div>Average processing <br /><br />times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</div></th></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td><div>19.7</div></td><td><div>29.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td><div>18.2</div></td><td><div>22.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td><div>17.2</div></td><td><div>23.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td><div>22.7</div></td><td><div>55.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td><div>15.2</div></td><td><div>20.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>30.0</div></td><td><div>31.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td><div>29.0</div></td><td><div>29.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td><div>23.5</div></td><td><div>29.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>40.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td><div>16.3</div></td><td><div>23.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td><div>14.7</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td><div>7.9</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td><div>16.3</div></td><td><div>26.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td><div>28.4</div></td><td><div>32.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td><div>17.5</div></td><td><div>28.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td><div>21.3</div></td><td><div>25.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td><div>27.8</div></td><td><div>37.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td><div>21.4</div></td><td><div>32.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td><div>67.7</div></td><td><div>40.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td><div>22.4</div></td><td><div>17.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td><div>19.6</div></td><td><div>26.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>55.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td><div>16.9</div></td><td><div>24.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td><div>20.2</div></td><td><div>29.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td><div>14.1</div></td><td><div>25.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td><div>14.3</div></td><td><div>19.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td><div>21.3</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td><div>19.6</div></td><td><div>12.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp; Assistance</td><td><div>33.6</div></td><td><div>41.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td><div>13.7</div></td><td><div>17.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefit</td><td><div>22.2</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td><div>16.3</div></td><td><div>21.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td><div>35.2</div></td><td><div>97.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td><div>16.0</div></td><td><div>26.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td><div>15.4</div></td><td><div>25.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td><div>18.9</div></td><td><div>31.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td><div>21.4</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td><div>17.2</div></td><td><div>23.9</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Companies were simply not hiring because they couldn't afford to recruit, and, in many cases, insisted on a minimum level of experience.  But large numbers of new jobseekers and people who lost their jobs in the recession couldn't get the relevant workplace experience they needed to get a first or a new job.</p>  <p>  That crisis is now over, the economy is growing and employers are hiring again.  The labour market has changed and new graduates and other jobseekers are once again finding work.  These changed circumstances mean that it is timely to consider whether or not a state- sponsored internship/work experience scheme is still required and, if so, what form such it should take.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that JobBridge has been a successful scheme and served a useful purpose during the period of recession, I am also mindful of the criticisms that have been made of the scheme and I intend to replace it later this year with a scheme that is better suited to the changed economic circumstances.</p>  <p>  JobBridge is currently the subject of an external independent evaluation and I will use the outcome of the review, due to be produced in September this year, to inform what changes should be made to improve outcomes for Jobseekers and value for money for the State.</p>  <p>  All internships that commence before September 2016 will be honoured by the Department.</p></reply>

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; proposal is based on the findings of a pan European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health and Safety Authority also contributed to the study.</p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness/disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department has in 2015, issued a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. </p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the &ldquo;Renaissance project&rdquo;, which is an initiative of my Department since 2003.  This has shown that early intervention reduced the incidence of progression from the acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants.</p>  <p>  While specific proposals for a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; require further development and examination, I would once again like to assure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the body of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and wellbeing and that, conversely, unemployment is damaging.  </p>  <p>  Current assessment procedures provide that any question in respect of eligibility to illness/disability related schemes is decided by a deciding officer of my Department who may in arriving at a decision, seek and have regard to the opinion of a Medical Assessor.  There are no current plans to alter these arrangements.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates to recipients under 26 years of age.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  There is now monthly engagement with all young jobseekers.  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 1 2016, youth unemployment continues to fall in line with the overall recovery and now stands at 16.9%.</p>  <p>  The review of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age will examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities.  I hope that this review will be completed later this year, subject to the necessary data being available and the required level of analysis involved being completed.  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.</p></reply>

The means test for earnings includes tapering arrangements, whereby a certain proportion of earnings are disregarded in order to provide a financial incentive to work.  For instance, for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients, the first &euro;60 of earnings is disregarded (earned over a maximum of three days) and 60% of the remainder is assessed as means.  Similarly, for one-parent family allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition recipients, the first &euro;90 of earnings is disregarded and 50% of the remainder is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  Increases in the minimum wage result in an overall financial gain for means-tested social welfare recipients who are working and on the minimum wage.  In Budget 2016, the minimum wage increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour.  Two other significant changes were introduced in the Budget which supported the beneficiaries of this increase.  The Family Income Supplement income thresholds were increased by &euro;5 per week for families with one child and by &euro;10 per week for families with two or more children.  In addition, a PRSI credit was introduced and benefits all workers earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week including minimum wage workers whose weekly income is in this range.  Workers earning less than &euro;352 per week continue to be exempt for making an employee PRSI contribution.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the earnings disregards or the income thresholds of social welfare schemes would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK).  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  The target group was young people with disabilities aged 16 &ndash; 24, including those with physical disability, sensory impairment, mental health problems, challenging behaviours, medical conditions and/or autism.</p>  <p>  A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that the learning from this activity should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.  Therefore, it is important to note that the projects were never intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right,   no matter how successful the projects might have been.</p>  <p>  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end date of 30 April 2015.  However, in the closure phase of the programme, it was recognised by the Department that there would be a number of people still actively participating on some of the DACT projects, so a decision was made to provide funding to seven of the projects, which included the WALK PEER project, for a short period to the end of July 2015.  This funding was provided so as to allow projects to ensure that their participants finished their involvement in an orderly manner.  All funding ended to the projects in July 2016.</p>  <p>  I understand that the WALK PEER project was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from a private sector organisation and I believe that it is this source of support that will terminate in July 2016.</p>  <p>  Given the origin and history of the project as set out above, it should be clear why there is no provision in my Department's estimates to provide further funding to this project or alternative projects as suggested by the Deputy</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) previously available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  There are no plans to introduce changes to this legislation which was introduced on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.</p>  <p>  In January 2016, and with reference to a number of factors including the increasing age at which a State pension can be drawn, the previous Government established an Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider policy that will support fuller working lives.  This Group, on which my Department is represented, is examining the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the private and public sectors.  I understand the Group is due to report to Government in the near future.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my department is not undertaking any measures which seek to actively influence customer choice in the manner of payment away from cash payments at the Post Office.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.</p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment.  My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.</p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.</p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.</p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.</p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.</p>  <p>  My Department will support the introduction by An Post of a standard bank account through the provision of seed funding to help start the initiative.</p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.</p></reply>

Currently, there are no circumstances under which a person&rsquo;s term on T&uacute;s can be extended.</p>  <p>  The T&uacute;s budget for 2016 is &euro;121.08 million which allows for 8,000 participants.  Extending the period of participation beyond one year would not impact on the cost of the programme but would instead reduce the number of placements available to those who are long term unemployed.  Currently the existing 12-month placement period on T&uacute;s is adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the initiative.</p>  <p>  T&uacute;s was introduced as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis.  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register, a review of work schemes, including T&uacute;s, is necessary to ensure that the number and nature of schemes and the conditions governing participation on same continues to be appropriate.  I will be considering all of these issues over the coming months.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administers a roster of election observers so that Ireland can be represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised, in the main, by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.</p>  <p>  Two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with a knowledge of election processes and experience of public service, separately undertook the independent appraisal and scoring of the 263 eligible applications for inclusion in the new roster against the four published criteria, which reflected the broad range of skills required for election observation.  These were: experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.</p>  <p>  Following the appraisal of all 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  A reserve panel of the next ten highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster.  Taking account of members who have left the roster, and those who have been added from the reserve panel, the current roster complement stands at 199 and the reserve panel has been fully utilised.</p>  <p>  For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of the expressions of interest submitted by roster members, the Department draws up a list of nominated observers.  In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience and language proficiency, form the principal basis for decision-making.  Issues of gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also taken into account.  The   EU makes the final selection of observers for EU election observation missions.</p>  <p>  Various factors influence the numbers of observers deployed each year.  In 2013, 72 observers were deployed, 53 in 2014, and 46 in 2015.  A total of 15 observers have been deployed to date in 2016 and a further 8 observers are expected to depart in the near future.</p>  <p>  The principal reason for the variation in numbers on an annual basis is the number of elections taking place in any given year where the host authorities have extended an invitation to the OSCE or EU to deploy an observation mission.  A further factor can be the postponement of planned elections.  Most recently, for instance, the planned parliamentary elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were postponed.  Ireland had intended to deploy six short term observers to join a long term observer already deployed.  In addition, it has happened that nominated observers, for compelling personal reasons, are unable to travel following nomination.  It is therefore difficult to provide a specific target for the number of long term and short term observers to be deployed for the rest of 2016, but the intent would be to reach, and hopefully exceed, the 2015 final outturn.</p>  <p>  For the parliamentary elections in Mongolia, we decided that the most effective contribution Ireland could make would be to send short term observers.  Five Irish observers will travel to Mongolia this month to oversee the elections.</p></reply>

We are continuing to pursue every constructive avenue to secure the release of this citizen and we will continue to bring all of our influence to bear on his behalf through all appropriate channels.</p>  <p>  I am aware of media references to a letter written by this citizen concerning allegations about the Egyptian prison system.  Officials in my Department meet regularly with this citizen&rsquo;s family and Irish-based lawyers and the fourth such meeting in the past eight weeks took place on 9 June.  The media reports of these allegations was one of the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  As would be the case for any Irish citizen imprisoned abroad, any concern related to ill-treatment would be treated with the utmost seriousness and would be raised urgently with the Egyptian authorities.  This point has been consistently reconfirmed to this citizen and his family.</p>  <p>  Significant resources continue to be deployed by my Department, both in Cairo and in Dublin, in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to the citizen at the heart of this case.  The Department has arranged exceptionally regular and frequent consular visits to this individual in prison since his arrest, the most recent undertaken by Ambassador Damien Cole on Sunday 29 May.  Consular visitation is an important practical tool in monitoring our citizen&rsquo;s welfare and ensuring that the Embassy in Cairo is well placed to raise any concerns arising directly with the prison authorities.</p>  <p>  The Egyptian Government is fully aware of the priority the Irish Government attaches to this case, and there continues to be sustained engagement at all levels with the Egyptian authorities.  The key focus of our engagement is to achieve the release of this citizen by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest opportunity and to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has twice met with President el-Sisi, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.  Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2014, I have remained in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry, on the case.</p>  <p>  In addition to this dialogue with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with European and international partners, who have had citizens detained in similar circumstances, and with the European Union.</p>  <p>  Irish Government representatives have worked with this citizen&rsquo;s legal team in Egypt and supported petitions to the court when asked to do so, including providing formal Government support for an application under Decree 140 and an application for release on bail.  Representatives of the Embassy have attended each of the court hearings to date and will be present at the next scheduled hearing on 29 June.</p>  <p>  Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government must remain measured and responsible in its public comment.  This is entirely consistent with our approach in other consular cases, with our clear objectives in this case and with what we firmly believe to offer the best prospect for a positive outcome for this young man.</p></reply>

The mandate for their negotiation derives from the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, between the EU and the ACP states.  Their central objective is the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development, and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.</p>  <p>  I obtained Government approval last month for the signing, subject to ratification, of the EU - Southern African Development Community (SADC) Economic Partnership Agreement.  The Agreement was subsequently signed by Ireland, along with other EU Member States, in Brussels on 1 June, in advance of the formal signing ceremony in Botswana on 10 June.</p>  <p>  This Agreement with Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland seeks to put trade at the service of development.  It is an instrument for development, jobs and growth in the long-term.  It seeks to support further trade diversification and regional integration in Southern Africa.</p>  <p>  The EU has agreed with its SADC partners that the Agreement may be applied provisionally, given that the process of ratification by all EU Member States, is likely to be a lengthy one.  The Council of the EU has duly authorised the EU to sign and provisionally apply the Agreement.  Provisional application of the Agreement is, of course, linked to the legal requirements of relevant signatories and the need to maintain a trading regime between the EU and the SADC signatories which is compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.  Where a SADC state does not foresee the possibility of provisionally applying the Agreement before ratification, the Agreement will apply to that SADC state only after it has ratified it in accordance with its applicable constitutional or internal rules.  Since the conclusion of the negotiations for the Agreement in July 2014, the EU has been working with the SADC signatories to achieve their ratification by 1 October 2016.</p>  <p>  I look forward to active engagement with our SADC partners to ensure that this important trade and development Agreement can achieve its potential to support their development priorities and needs.</p></reply>

Details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions in relation to foreign military aircraft are therefore accepted in good faith as being accurate.</p>  <p>  Information provided to other States by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Air Corps is similarly accepted by those countries to be accurate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-06-14a.800.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016061400071#WRN03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 347 together.</p>  <p>  I am concerned by the recent reports of violence, social unrest and killings in Colombia to which the Deputy refers.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a key priority for Ireland and we condemn unreservedly all attacks and threats against human rights defenders and other campaigners for social justice, wherever they take place.</p>  <p>  Agrarian protests involving the blockading of roads have been taking place across Colombia, and three protesters were killed in clashes with the police.  On 9 June, President Santos said that his government wished to establish a dialogue with the protestors to try to resolve the issue.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with Colombian social campaigners in Dublin last month to discuss the recent upsurge in violence against environmental and trade union activists.  Colombia faces significant challenges in securing lasting peace and security, particularly in its remote, rural districts.  It is clear that, as the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group nears its conclusion, there remain elements in Colombian society who oppose peace and who will seek to derail the agreement through violence.</p>  <p>  A climate of violence breeds human rights abuses, and only lasting peace can ensure the conditions necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights.  In that context, we must acknowledge the enormous progress that has been made in the peace talks between the Colombian Government and the FARC.  After over 50 years of violence, the talks are approaching a historic conclusion.  Moreover, on 30 March, the country&rsquo;s second-largest leftist guerrilla group, the ELN, announced that it would also participate in formal peace negotiations with the government.  In addition, the third major source of non-state violence, the criminal networks known as BACRIM (Bandas Criminales) which evolved from right-wing paramilitary organisations, are now the target of a major government effort to tackle organised crime and prevent such groups from destabilising the peace process.</p>  <p>  Human rights are at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Colombia.  To highlight our concern at attacks and threats against human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, officials from our embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia on a non-residential basis, meet with human rights groups and government officials during their regular visits to Colombia.  In addition, officials from my Department continue to raise our concerns around human rights in Colombia at EU level.</p>  <p>  Through the mechanism of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, the Union engages with the Colombian authorities in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, land restitution, economic and environmental issues.  It is our firm belief that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights in Colombia.</p>  <p>  A significant proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s funding to Colombia is focused on supporting human rights initiatives and human rights defenders.  In recent years, this has included funding to Christian Aid, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p></reply>

However, I would note that Pentonville remains a working prison, and the outcome of those discussions remains to be determined.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, Roger Casement's remains were exhumed from Pentonville in 1965 and returned to Ireland.

The FAC meeting was preceded by a ministerial meeting on the Eastern Partnership.</p><p>The Council had a wide-ranging discussion on the external aspects of migration.  The High Representative, Federica Mogherini (HRVP), highlighted the work that has been accomplished with the G5 Sahel Group (comprising Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger); the HRVP also mentioned that &euro;750m has been approved for security projects under the Valetta trust fund, with another funding round in June which will focus on further security projects.  Speaking about the considerable role that Turkey is playing in addressing the migrant crisis, I also reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in respect of the rule of law, human rights and freedom of the media in Turkey and the need to hold Turkey to account to the core European values inherent in the accession process.</p><p>Ministers noted the easing of migratory pressures in recent months, and underlined the need for short, medium and long term solutions; for contingency planning and for a focus on legal economic migration.  I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing role in providing humanitarian assistance through our bilateral arrangement with Italy.  Four Irish vessels have deployed to the Mediterranean since May 2015, most recently the <i>L.E. R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>.  To date they have rescued 9,374 people.  I also emphasised that it is only through tackling the root causes of migration- political instability, inequality, and poverty in countries of origin- that the EU can hope to resolve this global phenomenon.</p><p>The Council also discussed the threat posed by ISIL/Da&rsquo;esh, which incorporated a discussion on the situation in Iraq, and the need for a renewed focus on the political track in Syria.  Ministers underlined that the stabilisation of liberated areas is of the utmost importance in Iraq.  On Syria, the necessity of continued support for UN Special Envoy De Mistura was emphasised. Ministers agreed that the regional strategy remains valid, and adopted the related Council Conclusions.</p><p>The HRVP briefed Ministers on the ongoing preparation of the new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, which she is leading.  I intervened to highlight key issues of importance for Ireland, including the need for the strategy to address the root causes of instability, such as repression and denial of basic human rights; poor governance and corruption; poverty and underdevelopment.<i></i>I emphasised that the strategy should be firmly grounded in the Treaties and should aim to mobilise all aspects of the EU&rsquo;s external action in pursuit of coherent policy objectives.  The HRVP informed Ministers that it is expected that the strategy will be presented to the European Council in June.</p><p>The Eastern Partnership meeting brought together EU Foreign Ministers with the Foreign Ministers of the six Eastern Partnership countries.  The Ministerial meeting took place one year after the EU reaffirmed its support for the six participating countries at the May 2015 Riga Summit and was the first Eastern Partnership ministerial since the adoption of the Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy in December 2015.  The meeting was constructive and proved again that it is an effective framework for cooperation and dialogue with our Eastern neighbours.  I underscored that it is important that the Eastern Partnership continues to incentivise reform and progress, and joined with many other ministers in expressing concern for recent escalation of violence in Nagorno-Karabakh.  I appealed to all participants to engage actively with the OSCE Minsk Group to reach a sustainable agreement.</p></reply>

My Department is therefore actively engaging with the authorities and key stakeholders in France and Brazil in order that all appropriate measures are taken to ensure that Irish citizens travelling to both Euro 2016 and the Rio Olympic Games are safe.  The primary responsibility, of course, for the security of visitors in these countries lies with local police services, and we know that French and Brazilian authorities are taking security around these major events very seriously.</p><p>Detailed travel advice is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.dfa.ie</i>&ndash; and the Department&rsquo;s new TravelWise app which was launched on 10 June, and I would encourage all those considering travel to these or any other destinations this summer to study it carefully.</p><p>Our advice to Irish citizens travelling to France is that they should exercise a high degree of caution.  In view of the exceptional security situation in France following the terrorist attacks on 13 November, my Department has been developing and implementing a comprehensive action plan to ensure that our Embassy in Paris is equipped to deal with the likely increased consular demand over the coming weeks.  My Department has also been working closely with UEFA and the relevant national and local authorities in France, and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Football Association of Ireland and travel industry representatives in Ireland on planning and preparation.</p><p>The Embassy has been reinforced with an additional five experienced officers redeployed from Headquarters in Dublin. Officials have been present on the ground in Paris and will be present in Bordeaux and Lille around match dates to provide advice and emergency consular assistance to Irish citizens in difficulty.</p><p>There is a dedicated Euro 2016 consular phone line operational 7 days a week from 10 June at 00 33 1441 76780.  Specialised consular and emergency response training has been delivered to the staff at the Embassy and additional communications and IT equipment has also been provided in order to enhance our consular capacity.</p><p>My Department has also prepared an information campaign targeted at travelling football fans to help them be as well-informed as possible.  I launched this campaign on April 18 highlighting the &ldquo;First Eleven&rdquo; travel tips for fans.  A dedicated microsite has been published in order to relay all of the Department&rsquo;s key information in relation to the tournament: <i>.</i></p><p>Fifty thousand printed information leaflets, providing travel advice and key emergency contact details, were distributed at the recent friendly matches in Dublin and Cork, and more have been provided to airports, ferry ports, and Irish pubs in France, as well as being available on-line and on social media.  Both the aforementioned Department website and TravelWise app will remain a valuable source of information for Irish citizens abroad, and will be an important communications tool for our Government&rsquo;s consular response in the event of any emergency abroad.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s current travel advice for Brazil advises Irish citizens to exercise normal precautions.  Particular risks highlighted include high crime levels, road safety issues and mosquito-borne diseases, including the Zika virus.  In contrast to Euro 2016, the number of Irish citizens expected to travel to Brazil is relatively low, based on estimates from the Olympic Council of Ireland, with whom my Department is in regular contact.  The Embassy of Ireland in Brasilia and Consulate General in S&atilde;o Paulo have been<b></b>actively engaging with the Brazilian authorities in relation to all aspects of planning for the tournament, including regarding policing and ensuring that visiting Irish citizens attending Rio 2016 stay safe.  A temporary Consulate will be established in Rio de Janeiro for the duration of the Olympics and Paralympics tournaments.</p><p>My Department remains in close and continuous contact with the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on the Zika virus and additional health-related concerns.  Travel Advice in response to the Zika Virus outbreak, based on the advice of the HSE and the WHO, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This specifically and strongly recommends that pregnant women consider postponing their travel to Zika-affected areas.  We are closely monitoring the situation and will continue to regularly update our travel advice in this regard.</p><p>I encourage all citizens travelling to both France and Brazil to pay close attention to updates to the travel advice on the website and TravelWise app, check their passports are in date and arrange comprehensive travel insurance before they depart.  I would also urge all travelling fans to register their details on our Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility, also available through our website.</p></reply>

In particular, it aims to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives and dangerous sea journeys.  The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since the agreement entered into force suggests that it is achieving its aims.</p>  <p>  The need for the agreement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU Member States, including Ireland.  The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Agreement were not in breach of EU or International law.</p>  <p> The EU and Turkey have agreed that there will be no blanket returns.  Each migrant has the right to apply for international protection in Greece and to have their application assessed on an individual basis in line with international law, including with a right to appeal.  Part of this assessment process includes ascertaining whether Turkey can be considered a safe country given an irregular migrant or asylum seeker&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Turkey has provided formal guarantees as part of the EU-Turkey Agreement that Syrian refugees returned to Turkey will be granted temporary protection upon return.  Non-Syrians in need of international protection who are returned to Turkey, will also be able to apply for and receive protection there.  The European Commission reported on 4 May that Turkey has received all those returned from Greece in accordance with the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The EU is also committed to assisting Turkey deal with the enormous challenge of hosting some 2.7 million refugees and to improve the situation for these refugees.  To this end, the EU has established a &euro;3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey.  This Facility aims to support Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, including testimony from migrants and witnesses that some Turkish border guards have used violence against Syrians.  These reports are very worrying and will require a full investigation by the Turkish authorities.  While Turkey has a right to secure its border with Syria, all actions on the part of Turkey must be in line with international law.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at European Council and continues to form an integral part of the country&rsquo;s enlargement process, which we, along with our European partners keep under close review.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in respect of the rule of law, human rights and freedom of the media in Turkey and the need to hold Turkey to account to the core European values inherent in the accession process.</p></reply>

These ceilings took into account certain of the key non-discretionary drivers of expenditure including: projected expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics; and the projected carry over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures including additional pay costs arising under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The expenditure ceilings also reflected agreed policy in relation to the multi-annual capital investment framework as set out in the Public Capital Plan.  The expenditure ceilings do not take into account the impact of general inflationary increases.</p>  <p>  An effective public expenditure framework has several key elements in addition to multi-annual ceilings including:</p>  <p>  - Regular Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure that take into account whether or not the programmes are delivering, changes in government priorities, and proposals for new expenditure programmes</p>  <p>  - Reviews of expenditure programmes being informed by relevant evaluations of the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes utilising the Public Spending Code and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service;</p>  <p>  - Performance Budgeting with a focus on the impact of public services;</p>  <p>  - Greater engagement with the Oireachtas in reviewing the expenditure challenges and priorities.</p>  <p>  The Summer Economic Statement (SES) to be published this month will provide an updated assessment of the macro-economic and fiscal prospects, including the medium-term fiscal framework.  The proposed Mid-Year Expenditure Report to be published in July will also inform expenditure priorities and challenges in advance of Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  In looking at medium term expenditure projections, it is appropriate to utilise all elements of the public expenditure framework to ensure that the available resources are directed to effectively deliver key social and economic priorities.  This must be enabled through a continuing emphasis on value-for-money and effectiveness, enabled by public service reforms and the focus on outputs provided by performance budgeting initiative.</p></reply>

This will allow expenditure to be increased to meet the additional costs arising from an ageing and growing population and to provide for targeted improvements in public services.  In addition, the Government proposes a cumulative additional &euro;4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021.</p>  <p>  The Fiscal Assessment Report outlines that the Programme does not set out a detailed costing of policy proposals.  In this regard, as outlined in the Programme, for every policy challenge, the new Government will ensure that a balance is struck between addressing urgent priorities - utilising the action plan framework set out in the Programme document - and engaging in long-term planning and thinking, so that lasting solutions with broad based support are implemented.</p>  <p>  In order to implement this approach effectively in practice, a key action for the Government's first hundred days is securing agreement with the Oireachtas on putting in place a reformed budget process.  This is intended to secure a significantly more participatory approach, underpinned by a substantially enhanced D&aacute;il input into and feedback on the development of budgetary priorities.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that an important element of this new model will be to facilitate appropriate consultation and engagement on the costings of specific measures intended to respond to particular Programme priorities, as well as examining how these measures align with overall fiscal parameters.</p>  <p>  This new approach will have a central role to play in guiding and informing deliberation by the Oireachtas on budgetary options and in shaping the Government's budgetary proposals for specific measures to deliver the Programme priorities.</p></reply>

In carrying out these functions, my main focus is to ensure that the victims of the Irish Famine are respectfully and appropriately remembered.  In that context, I also seek to raise awareness of current food security issues worldwide.  I can confirm that the Committee has previously discussed the issue of a fixed date for the commemoration and is of the view that, while we aspire to organise the National Famine Commemoration on the second Sunday in May of each year and do so wherever possible, some degree of flexibility is required around this date.  This flexibility is needed to try to adapt to the demanding schedules faced by the President and An Taoiseach with a view to their leading the official representation at the annual National Famine Commemoration ceremony whenever possible and also to allow for the particular circumstances that may arise around the arrangements, including the choice of site, in any given year.</p>  <p>  For example, in 2015 the commemoration was held in September due to organisational matters which arose as a result of the staging of the event for the first time in Northern Ireland.  The event, held in in Newry, Co Down, proved to be a great success with significant cross-community representation.  This year, due to the number of events relating to the centenary of the Easter Rising which took place in March, April and May, it was decided that the National Famine Commemoration should take place in September.  This will allow the ceremony to receive the level of public attention and participation that it warrants as a major national commemorative event.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the retention of flexibility in relation to the date of the commemoration does not detract from its key aim, which is to have a fitting national ceremony to remember and show respect for all those who died or suffered loss during the Great Famine.  In fact, this flexibility facilitates the commemoration being held in the most appropriate context each year.

This includes approximately &euro;31 million in capital funding for major projects including the new commemorative and visitor centre at the GPO and the refurbishment and redevelopment of Richmond Barracks among other projects. These projects will leave a lasting legacy from the commemorations.    The allocation of over &euro;18m in current funding for 2016 is also supporting the extensive list of State events, a significant international cultural programme supported by my Department through Culture Ireland, as well as programmes in our National Cultural Institutions, local community initiatives and major set piece events. This funding is also supporting a programme to commemorate the centenary of the Battle of the Somme which includes a ceremonial event and other initiatives including those within the National Cultural Institutions.</p>  <p>  All funding has been fully allocated across the various programme strands and expenditure is monitored closely.  Due to the scale and complexity of this once-off programme for 2016, it is inevitable that adjustments will be made to respond as the programme develops through the year. Some elements require additional funding to respond to emerging needs, for example, to cater for the huge public demand to participate in the very successful Easter weekend commemorative events.  Other elements, particularly capital projects, may show delayed drawdown in allocated funding due to outside factors, for example, the plans to restore the National Monument at Moore Street which were delayed by legal action. I am confident, however, that all Centenary Programme commitments can be met within the overall allocation made available to my Department.</p>  <p>  Many of the initiatives, by their nature, involve once-off spending.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for an appropriate programme of events through-out the Decade of Commemorations. The funding required will vary in response to the major events of the Decade.</p></reply>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is part of my Department, which has the statutory responsibility to advise on the protection of habitats and species identified for nature conservation, including designating sites as Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) under the Wildlife Acts 1976-2012, Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under EU Birds Directive.  Many of the rivers and low-lying lands affected by the recent flooding are within or near sites that have been designated as SACs or SPAs.  Accordingly, these sites fall within the ambit of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, which are transposed in Irish legislation through the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011) and compliance with which is a matter for all public authorities, agencies and landowners.  </p><p>The proposed Crossmolina Flood Alleviation Scheme is within the River Moy SAC.  The River Deel, a tributary of the Moy, has been designated for the conservation of White-clawed Crayfish (<i>Austropotamobius pallipes</i>), Sea Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus), </i>Brook Lamprey (<i>Lampetra planeri</i>), Atlantic Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) and Otter (<i>Lutra lutra</i>).  Freshwater Pearl Mussel (<i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i>) is also present in the Deel.  All of the above species are listed in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive.</p><p>The Crossmolina Flood Alleviation Scheme is currently being developed by the OPW.  Along with Mayo County Council, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Crossmolina Flood Action Group, the NPWS sits on the Crossmolina Flood Alleviation Scheme Working Group and plays a constructive role on how the Scheme can address issues relating to nature conservation.</p><p>NPWS officials attended meetings of the Crossmolina Flood Alleviation Scheme Working Group on 11<sup>th</sup>March and 12<sup>th</sup>May this year, and are scheduled to attend the next meeting on 16<sup>th</sup>June.</p><p>The NPWS has not prevented any works being undertaken on the River Deel and has facilitated the installation of turbidity meters and flow meters for the monitoring of the scheme.  The recent suspension of vegetation removal by OPW was in compliance with the Wildlife Acts and their own environmental protocols.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Wildlife Acts provide that vegetation removal of the nature undertaken may only take place between 1 September to 28 February.</p></reply>

The report examined how the health and social care system is responding to the care needs, required supports and preferences of older people, as perceived by Social Workers working with older people.</p>  <p>  The findings show that the preferences of older people are to remain in their homes for as long as possible, receiving care in this setting when needed.  The report suggests that the present social care approach has not been resourced adequately to meet the actual needs of older people.</p>  <p>  I recognise that most older people want to stay at home and in their communities for as long as possible and this Government is committed to facilitating this.  Demand for home care services is rising as more people are supported in their own homes rather than in hospitals or nursing homes and I am delighted that the Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing additional resources for home care services.  Details will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

I would also like to clarify the process, as the premise of your question is incorrect, and have set out the factual position below for your information.</p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. </p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug  is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi). This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the  manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that  all relevant costs were included in the analysis.</p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i></i>.</p><p>The HSE will now enter into negotiations with the manufacturer, to seek very significant price reductions.  The HSE will then consider the outcome of these negotiations, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context and as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.

A Steering Committee, chaired by former General Secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation and with representatives from the relevant Statutory, Community and Voluntary Sectors, has been established to oversee the process.  The Steering Committee  will provide guidance and advice to me on how a new Strategy should address problem drug use, including the structures through which this could be done and incorporating key performance indicators to measure the future effectiveness of the new policy. </p>  <p>  A high-level review of the current drugs policy has been undertaken by a panel of international experts, which will highlight the key issues that need to be addressed under the new Strategy. The Committee will also consider the approach to drug policy in other jurisdictions and a review of international evidence on interventions to tackle the drug problem. Focus Groups have been established to advise the Steering Committee on the relevance of the Strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of problem drug use in Ireland, including emerging trends and cross-cutting issues.  This aspect of the process will identify any actions that need to be undertaken under the new Strategy to meet challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  I will shortly be announcing details of the consultation process on the new Strategy, which I intend to be as broad, comprehensive and inclusive as possible.  I am expecting the final report of the Steering Committee by the end of the year.</p></reply>

It is understood that in the region of 45 employees are members of the funded pension scheme in question.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that the CRC took a decision to cease contributions to the scheme without first consulting with the HSE in relation to scheme solvency and seeking a viable alternative for the employees concerned.  In particular options for restructuring the scheme should have been explored with the HSE in advance of a decision to wind up the scheme.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of information from the CRC in relation to the wind up of the scheme, the CRC was requested as a matter of urgency, to prepare viable alternative proposals in conjunction with the HSE.  A detailed business case in relation to alternative options has not yet been submitted by the HSE in relation to this matter, however I understand that on 1st June the CRC made an initial submission to the HSE which the HSE is currently considering.</p>  <p>  When a detailed business case is received from the HSE, my Department will, as a matter of urgency, consider the proposals in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The latter is responsible for Government policy in relation to public service pensions.  Pension schemes and pension terms for public servants generally require the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

Any product which makes a medicinal claim to treat medical conditions such as autism is considered to be a medicine and requires an authorisation under this legislation.</p>  <p>  The product referred to as Chlorine Dioxide or CD Protocol, otherwise known as Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is not authorised as a medicine for sale or supply in Ireland.  Any manufacture, supply or sale of this product for the purposes of treating a medical condition is illegal. </p>  <p>  The HPRA, the competent authority for the implementation of the medicines legislation, has led a number of investigations into the alleged supply of CD Protocol in various parts of Ireland for the alleged treatment of autism.  It is pursuing a number of avenues of enquiry in what continues to be an open investigation into the manufacture, supply and sale of this product. </p>  <p>  During its investigations to date, the HPRA has carried out searches at a number of premises assisted, where necessary, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has also spoken to a number of individuals.  In each case, substances and/or equipment have been detained for further examination. </p>  <p>  The HPRA, in cooperation with the Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other international regulatory and law enforcement agencies, actively monitors the online movements and supply of prescription and illicit medicines to Ireland.  The HPRA uses a range of enforcement powers to tackle this activity including seizing product and taking prosecutions. </p>  <p>  On July 1 the EU logo signifying the legitimacy of websites of pharmacies and medicines retailers was introduced in order to place controls upon, and reduce the significant health risk posed by, falsified medicines. Members of the public are strongly urged not to purchase medicines from an internet site which does not have the EU internet logo. In Ireland these controls apply to pharmacies/ retailers involved in the internet supply of non-prescription medicines.  The internet supply of prescription medicines continues to remain prohibited in Ireland on grounds of public health protection.</p>  <p>  I would reiterate the advice of the HPRA and recommend against the purchase of any prescription, or unauthorised medicines online.  Further information can be found in the HPRA&rsquo;s leaflet, &ldquo;The Dangers of Buying Prescription Medicines Online&rdquo;.  For those already in possession of such products, consumers who feel any ill effects from taking any products purchased online should contact their doctor immediately. Any remaining product should not be taken.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government states that the Government will improve services and increase supports for people with disabilities, particularly for early assessment and intervention for children with special needs.  In that context, the HSE is in the process of reconfiguring services for children with a disability under their National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).</p>  <p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, non-statutory service providers and parents.  It is envisaged that the Programme, when implemented, will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children who require access to health related supports.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2016 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 75 therapy posts.  Following detailed consideration by the Executive, these additional therapy posts have now been allocated and the recruitment process to fill same is currently underway.  </p>  <p>  As implementation of the Programme and the questions the Deputy has raised are a service matter, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.  If she has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The overall objective of the National Drugs Strategy is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</p>  <p>  The nature and scale of drug misuse has changed in recent years, with an increased prevalence of polydrug use which is the problem use of more than one drug, including alcohol.  Polydrug use can make treating the person more difficult and often increases the complexity of the case.  It can also make the treatment of overdose more complicated.  Health Research Board figures indicate that polydrug use is a common issue among those presenting at drug and alcohol treatment services.  Between 2009 and 2013, 63% of those treated for a drug as their main problem substance also reported problem use of other substances, mainly alcohol, benzodiazepines and cannabis. Figures from the Health Research Board for recent years also indicate that the number of polydrug deaths has overtaken the number of single drug deaths.  This highlights the need to have an integrated public health approach to substance misuse.</p>  <p>  The 2011 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD), which contains data on substance use among 15-16 year old students, confirms that there was no change in lifetime use of cannabis among Irish students and a decrease in the lifetime use of other illicit drugs between 2007 and 2011.  The 2015 wave of the survey, which will also feature data on Irish students, will be published in September 2016.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is developing a new National Drugs Strategy, which will cover the period from 2017 onwards.  A Steering Committee has been established to advise me on how the new Strategy should address problem drug use, including the structures through which this could be done, and incorporating performance indicators to measure the future effectiveness of the new Strategy.</p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity, or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the European Commission advises that area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS.  Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible.</p>  <p>  With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements every 2 years.  Therefore if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after 2 years unless he (a) got more land (b) leased out his entitlements or (c) sold the entitlements.</p>  <p>  Finally it is important to note that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned/leased, used and managed by the applicant.  If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted.  Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable.</p></reply>

In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has carried out a number of studies to check for the presence of PBDEs.  The results of this monitoring confirm the low levels of such contaminants in the Irish environment.</p>  <p>  The EPA also carries out additional testing in areas that might be viewed as areas of potentially higher risk of containing these substances.  One of these monitoring samples in a raw milk sample from a farm in Co. Cork showed somewhat elevated levels of PBDEs, though the level was not high by European comparison.  The levels found do not constitute a risk for public health.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, an inter-agency group of experts from the EPA, the FSAI and my Department was established to investigate the cause of the elevated levels in this case.  Following considerable investigation, including a comprehensive testing regime of a number of matrices, including milk, various feed materials, water and other substances in the animal housing, the source of the problem was established.  The source was identified as coming from a particular old matting material used as bedding in the cow cubicles in the animal housing on the farm. Accordingly the source of the problem did not have its origins in the surrounding environment.</p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections be completed.  The application of the person named was selected for a Full Cross-Compliance inspection.</p>  <p>  This inspection identified breaches in relation to pig and cattle identification and registration requirements resulting in a 1% penalty being recorded in respect of each category.  Breaches were also identified in relation to Nitrates requirements as a result of inadequate facilities for dealing with clean and soiled water, inadequate collection of the manure and approx.  100 round bales of silage were stored within 20 meters of a drain.  This resulted in a 5% penalty being applied.  However as breaches in relation to Nitrates requirements were identified in 2014, the rules on re-occurrence were applied and the penalty was increased to 15%. </p>  <p>  Further breaches were identified in relation to Pig and Animal Welfare requirements.  In respect of Welfare of Pigs, poor animal husbandry, building accommodation, lighting, feed and water requirements resulted in a 5% penalty being applied.  However as breaches in relation to Welfare of Pigs requirements were identified in 2014, the rules on re-occurrence were applied and the penalty was increased to 15%.</p>  <p>  In respect of Welfare of Animals, very poor animal remedy records and no mortality records were maintained giving rise to a sanction of 5% being applied.  However as similar breaches in this area were identified in 2014, the rules on re-occurrence were applied and the penalty was increased to 15%.</p>  <p>  In total a 15% cross compliance penalty was applied to the 2015 Direct Payments being received by the person named.  The person named was notified of this decision on 3 February 2016.  The person named was also notified of the right to seek a review of this decision.  To date no request for a review has been received by my Department.</p>  <p>  In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such review the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within 3 months.</p></reply>

We have submitted a range of proposals to the Commission aimed at more effectively achieving the outcomes envisaged under the schemes, while at the same time maintaining flexibility for Member States to implement these provisions in accordance with their domestic farming circumstances.  The Commissioner has responded with a number of simplification initiatives, and has indicated that a further package of measures in relation to Greening will be presented to Member States at the Council of Ministers meeting later this month.</p>  <p>  I look forward to examining the content of these latest proposals, and I intend to continue my dialogue with Commissioner Hogan with a view to ensuring that scheme requirements are met in a way that minimises the potential burden for farmers and for Member State administrations.</p></reply>

All applications in &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is engaged in a comprehensive programme of gathering the necessary baseline data appropriate to the Conservation Objectives of &lsquo;Natura&rsquo; areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  This is followed by data analysis and the setting of appropriate Conservation Objectives by the NPWS.  Once this process is complete all new, renewal and review aquaculture applications can be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  </p>  <p>  The Appropriate Assessment of Castlemaine Harbour has been completed and the relevant licensing determinations have been made based on applications to hand at the time of the assessment.  </p>  <p>  The specific application referred by the Deputy was submitted to my Department subsequent to the carrying out of the Appropriate Assessment process for this harbour.  Accordingly, it was not possible to assess this application against the designated Conservation Objectives for the harbour. </p>  <p>  The optimum method for appropriately assessing applications by individual operators, who were not included in the initial overall assessment procedure, is under active consideration by my Department.  The process must comply with best scientific practice and be achieved in a manner which will be acceptable to the national authorities and to the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the assessment procedures agreed with the EU Commission require Appropriate Assessments in respect of aquaculture activities to be carried out by the national authorities and unilateral departure from these arrangements is not possible.  </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to expedite the conclusion of this matter as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This initiative was to support the work of the Department&rsquo;s local District Veterinary Offices in dealing with this increased level of work.  Staffing of the CMMS unit at the outset consisted of four teams of 3 Supervisory Agricultural Officers in 4 different locations with 2 District Superintendents having a supervisory role - a total of 14 staff.  While primarily staff at DVOs dealt with identification and tracing matters (among other duties), the CMMS units handled specific and targeted enquiries generally, in particular on repeat offenders and on cases that involved more than one DVO area.  The focus of the group was exclusively on cattle identification and tracing matters wherever such was required and necessary - this could have arisen on farm or at other locations. </p><p>For operational purposes, the staff assigned to the CMMS Unit were under the supervision of an Area Superintendent of the then Special Investigation Unit (SIU).  The CMMS unit staff were not part of the SIU which was a separate Unit. </p><p>In 2009 a review of the Local Office Structure within my Department was carried out in order to maximise efficiency.  This review led to several significant changes at operational level.  As the volume of discrepancies had decreased significantly and there was, following the local office review, sufficient capacity among local office staff to carry out all such work, it was decided to stand down the CMMS Unit and deploy the staff to other areas of my Department where vacancies existed.  As a result, the CMMS Unit was disbanded in 2011/2012.  </p><p>In Sept 2010, my Department met with the staff side&rsquo;s representatives to discuss the redeployment of the staff that had been assigned to the CMMS unit.  At this time there were eleven technical staff remaining in the Unit.  Following the announcement of the proposed transfers all those eleven staff in the CMMS Unit, lodged similar individual complaints regarding work issues against line management under the Civil Service Grievance Procedure. </p><p>Mediation efforts were made on 2 occasions, in July 2012 and again in October 2014.  In the former case, the mediator withdrew from the process as he was of the view that the issues raised were not relevant to the grievance procedure.  In the latter case, the mediator made an offer, to bring closure to the issue and allow the parties to move forward.  That offer was not accepted. </p><p>My Department, as is common with all other Departments, makes available the confidential services of the Employee Assistance Officers to all civil service staff wishing to avail of those services. </p><p>My Department is constantly assessing its investigative capabilities as it is crucial that my Department has the capability to undertake detailed investigations in order to ensure the integrity of the food chain, protection of public health, animal health and welfare, and plant health.  A new Investigation Division (ID) was set up in 2014.  This Division is staffed with members with mixed skills, competencies, experience and backgrounds reflecting the range of work that will be carried out by the Division and where staff work in multi-disciplinary teams, rather than in a hierarchical structure.  The current complement of staff in the Investigations Division is 10 &ndash; this includes 6 former staff of the Special Investigations Unit &ndash; two further staff members are to be assigned shortly.</p><p>Animal level discrepancies outstanding greater than 1 month<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Jan 2007</td><td>191,203 </td></tr><tr><td>Jan 2008</td><td>86,180</td></tr><tr><td>Jan 2009</td><td>37,383</td></tr><tr><td>Sept 2010</td><td>22,148</td></tr></table></p></reply>

No. 163/2011 - Marine Tourism (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011 confers on me a limited and narrow role in the development of Marine Leisure generally.  However, overall responsibility for Marine Leisure Development transcends a number of Departments.  Responsibility for the promotion of cultural heritage rests with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht while the promotion of tourism rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Those Ministers, their Departments and agencies publish policies and operate schemes to provide funding in a structured way.  Additionally, local authorities provide funding for community-based maritime projects.  The Heritage Council proposes and advises on national heritage policy and interacts with the local authorities through the Heritage Officer programme.  </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the development, repair and maintenance of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways rests with the Local Authorities in the first instance and their parent Department, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  My Department does, however provide funding to assist in the development and repair of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways under the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme subject to available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  There is a Marine Leisure element to this programme. </p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the deputy that in 2016 an overall &euro;4.5m package was approved to assist in the development and repair of 90 Local Authority owned harbours and slipways including some marine leisure projects.  The package provides funding for the repair of piers damaged by recent storms, in addition to supporting the ongoing development and enhancement of other harbour facilities.  18 Marine Leisure projects attracted funding of &euro;927,000 as part of this programme.</p></reply>

This uses an 'ABC 123' structure to reference in the first instance the relevant Post Town, and secondly the 'Block Face' (a grouping of approximately 40 to 50 dwellings); it was, however,  recognised at that time that there were advantages in introducing a postcode based on a unique identifier.  In 2010,  54 interested parties  were consulted as part of an extensive  consultation process on the introduction of postcodes.  The consultation  exercise concluded that  for the postcode to be of real benefit it had to be unique to each address.  Following consideration of the matter by Government in 2010, the Department proceeded to the first stage of procurement to launch a National Postcode System.  The procurement documentation, having regard to the output from the stakeholder consultation process, envisaged that the postcode  model would be capable of being refined into a location based code &ndash; in other words of identifying each individual property within a post town.</p>  <p>  The reason for the adoption of the unique identifier approach was to resolve two addressing challenges:</p>  <p>- 35% of addresses are non-unique which means  many properties, particularly in rural areas,  share the same address; and</p>  <p>- in both urban and rural areas, the same property can have multiple forms of address. </p>  <p>  A hierarchical based code is not the optimum solution for Ireland as it does not have the capacity to uniquely identify premises nor  is it future proofed  as it is not possible to assign a sequenced code to new builds (for example any infill development will break the sequence of the code in the event that a sequenced code were used).</p></reply>

In addition to the statistic referenced by the Deputy in his question, the report also notes that two thirds of the survey respondents said the introduction of the Eircode postcode system has been a positive development for the Irish Market, with 73% of shipping respondents and 64% of logistics &amp;amp; E-Commerce companies saying the introduction of Eircode has been a positive development.</p>  <p>  Information available to my Department indicates that a significant number of commercial bodies have incorporated the Eircode into their online services, and this continues to grow.  Since the launch, Capita, the Postcode Management Licence Holder (PMLH), has signed up a total of 28 Eircode Value Added Re-sellers who provide a broad spectrum of Eircode specialist services to businesses including, location based applications for logistics/deliveries sector, address validation, database cleansing, address look ups and a range of spatial analytic applications.  These 28 VARs have signed licences with 399 End User organisations who are using Eircodes in their businesses.  The industries using Eircode data include Retail, Logistics/Delivery, Financial Services, Insurance, Utilities and Public Sector bodies.  Most of the Eircode licenced End Users are using the data for address verification and deliveries, as well as for risk assessment in Insurance and Financial Services.</p>  <p>  The integration of Eircodes into the relevant business systems of individual firms is linked to their systems development lifecycle which can, in some cases, lead to a time lag before Eircodes are used by the business in their day-to-day operations and in their service offerings.  The timing of the integration process is a matter for  individual businesses to take.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that once Eircodes are used in Google applications and Sat Navs, their usage will increase.</p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure that those services are delivered.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes the townland of Carrig Island, as well as Ballylongford in the townland of Aghanagran Middle, County Kerry.  Members of the public can view whether their premises are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Kerry.</p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus of the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to short-listed bidders, following the assessment of responses to the PQQ stage.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract(s) which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology to be deployed will be made clear.  </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht. Once contract(s) are in place, I expect to publish a detailed rollout plan for the network.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces,  working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once contract(s) have been awarded.</p></reply>

It is likely that the taskforce will involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with telecommunications operators. My Department has already conducted a number of meetings with vendors and mobile operators to help inform the process and identify what tangible measures can be taken. The Taskforce will consider what form of public engagement is appropriate and I intend to set a challenging timeline for delivery.</p>  <p>  The provision of mobile telephony services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers operating in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). It is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence. The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg and accordingly I have no statutory function in this matter. </p>  <p>  I am aware however that licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations. The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons. ComReg monitors compliance with licence requirements by means of bi-annual drive tests. I understand that current testing is designed to cover all primary and secondary national routes, with measurements being performed on all Mobile Networks.</p>  <p>  4G offers potential to deliver better services to people, particularly in rural areas, where the fixed broadband network has not yet been upgraded. There are several ways in which improved wireless broadband and mobile voice services can be achieved. This includes the Government and Local Authorities working to reduce barriers to the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure through better planning laws and processes; and working with telecommunications operators to improve information on various aspects of their activities, including upgrades and changes to their networks.   </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and other relevant Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services including acquiring spectrum under ComReg's 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction for rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services. These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. ComReg is also planning the further release of spectrum to assist in the rollout of mobile services, particularly in rural areas.   </p></reply>

This will require careful consideration in terms of the membership of the dialogue, its format and how it engages with the wider public.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered. The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention. The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.</p>  <p>  Based on information previously  provided by commercial operators, 14% of the townland of Brittas, County Kilkenny will be covered by commercial operators with the remaining 86% of premises of the townland of Brittas being part of the State Intervention. Members of the public can view whether their premises in  Kilkenny are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus for  the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

Following consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority, the previous Minister decided not to include this offence in the first phase of fixed charge notices for cycling offences.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, while road traffic legislation does not specify exemptions for children, I understand that the Children Act 2001, as amended in 2006, provides that no child under the age of twelve may be charged with an offence.  There are exceptions to this rule which relate to serious violent offences and are not relevant in a road traffic context.</p>  <p>  Children under twelve years of age cannot therefore be charged with any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, and this includes cycling on pavements.</p></reply>

Therefore, the assumptions to be made in predicting future passenger demand is a matter for daa, having regard to all relevant national and international factors, including those related to the reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the DAA that they are committed to the successful management of impacts on the environment, and that they will work effectively with key stakeholders such as the IAA and airlines in this regard. It should be noted that no assumptions are made in relation to aviation emissions under the Paris Agreement (COP21). The challenge of mitigating aviation emissions is dealt with through the international body ICAO, which plans to bring forward measures later this year designed to ensure carbon neutral growth in international aviation emissions from 2020.</p></reply>

The NAP envisaged my Department commissioning a high-level strategic capacity review of Irish airports with the Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports being mandated to carry out their own capacity reviews at five yearly intervals. While it had been planned that the reviews would commence in 2018, my Department may review this timeline, given the higher than expected passenger growth trends.</p></reply>

Details of these programmes can be viewed at <i>www.smartertravel.ie</i>.</p><p>Significant investment in public transport will be continued under the Capital Plan which provides &euro;3.6bn in capital funding for public transport over the period 2016-2022.Investment is paying dividends in terms of modal shift as is evidenced by the results of the recently published 2015 Canal Cordon Count in Dublin.  Half of all people travelling into Dublin City Centre in the mornings are now arriving by public transport (bus, rail, Luas) &ndash; an increase from 45.9% in 2010. A further 9.4% walk into the city centre and 5.4% cycle.  Fewer than a third &ndash; 32.6% - of people travelled into the city centre by car, down from 39.8% in 2010.</p><p>​In addition to this investment in public transport infrastructure and services, my Department is currently developing a new National Policy Framework to support the uptake of alternative fuels through the development of infrastructure and incentives aimed at increasing the number of greener, alternative fuelled vehicles being used in Ireland.  Within this context, and as reflected in the White Paper on Energy Policy which was published last year, it is proposed to establish a green bus fund to support the purchase of cleaner and greener public transport vehicles in the period to 2020.​</p></reply>

The calculation of subsidy levels and what constitutes subsidies varies considerably and can lead to confusion comparing statistics which are in actual fact made up of different elements.</p>  <p>  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the company operates three distinct businesses - PSO services; commercial Expressway services; and School Transport services; however, the PSO subsidy is only provided in respect of the PSO services and business and therefore the level of subsidy is a factor of subsidy provided against revenue collected on PSO services only.</p>  <p>  On that basis the figure for Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2014 is a &euro;0.47 subsidy provided for every &euro;1 in revenue collected, while the provisional figures for 2015 suggest a &euro;0.43 subsidy.  This indicates a subsidy level which is substantially higher than the Deputy is suggesting.</p>  <p>  This highlights the difficulty in accurately comparing subsidy levels across the EU and while I acknowledge that there are EU Member States that do provide higher subsidy levels than our current provision, it is the case that any crude comparison must be subject to close scrutiny to avoid any distortion of fact.</p></reply>

Of course that figure solely relates to the provision of public transport services and does not include the considerable capital funding provided in terms of public transport infrastructure.  I am obliged, and I believe that everyone in this House is similarly obliged, to ensure that the taxpayer is getting the best possible value for this significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.</p>  <p>  What the Deputy refers to as "a significant portion of Dublin Bus routes" is actually just 10% of Dublin Bus' current PSO routes.  The NTA has the statutory power to assess the appropriate mix of directly award and competitively tendered PSO bus services and in line with those statutory powers it has initiated this process to determine the operators of these particular services. Experience gained across the European Union suggests that savings to the taxpayer can arise through using competitive tendering as the award mechanism.</p>  <p>  In terms of pay and conditions, the NTA requires any transport operator who operates public transport services to act within the law, including relevant employment legislation.  Consistent with this approach, the forthcoming tendering process conducted by the NTA will require any transport operator who is awarded a contract to comply with relevant employment legislation.</p>  <p>  The NTA has completed the pre-qualification phase of the competition and expects to issue formal invitations to tender to qualified parties very shortly.</p>  <p>  The process underway will allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value for money and quality and I look forward to the NTA's announcement as regards this competition, and the other two bus related competitions, later this year.</p></reply>

A major objective for the new Government will be to prioritise new investment in local and regional road maintenance and improvements, and LIS funding will be promoted in that context.</p></reply>

The transport element of this plan is predicated on three priorities which are: to keep the existing road and rail network well maintained and operating efficiently and safely; to address urban congestion and ensure that the public transport system has the capacity to meet growing demand to support competitiveness, economic growth and quality of life; and to encourage modal shift in traffic patterns so as to support our emission reduction targets.</p>  <p>  We are in the first year of the plan which will see a gradual return to the necessary levels of investment to maintain our existing road and rail network to protect those assets now and into the future.  The plan will in time provide for a major transport project for north Dublin (Metro North) to tackle congestion in an area of the country due to experience rapid population growth.  It will also see a schedule of investments to expand and improve the road network around Ireland, some of which are identified in the plan.  Apart from projects specifically identified in the Capital Plan, such as Dart Underground and Metro North, there will be scope to consider the cost/benefit of restoring other projects which we were unable to progress during the economic downturn, as fiscal parameters allow.</p></reply>

In the normal course, receivers are appointed on foot of a power contained in an instrument such as a debenture.  It is thus a matter for the lender to determine the qualifications of the receiver when making the appointment.  Section 433 of the Companies Act 2014 sets out the categories of persons who are disqualified to act as the receiver of a company e.g. an undischarged bankrupt; an employee or an officer of the company concerned or a person who was such within the period of 12 months before the date of the commencement of the receivership; and certain specified family members of an officer of the company concerned.</p>  <p>  Receivership is a remedy that derives from the courts of equity.  The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Under the Companies Act 2014 a receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 which provides that: </p>  <p>  (i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and </p>  <p>  (ii) the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.  </p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.  Conferring statutory powers on receivers is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  It should be noted that receivers also have a duty to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  </p></reply>

Predatory pricing may amount to an abuse of a dominant position in breach of section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, and/or Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  By definition, a firm&rsquo;s conduct can only be &ldquo;predatory&rdquo; if the firm occupies a dominant position.

A new warehousing facility is being built which will double existing capacity and will enable the business to increase their direct delivery service to their customers. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland outlined to the company the support provided to clients in relation to research and development, environmental improvements and achieving best practice through increased competitiveness.

In this Report Ireland is ranked 17<sup>th </sup>for Ease of Doing Business, out of 189 countries.  This places Ireland 4<sup>th</sup>in the Euro area and 7<sup>th</sup>in the EU.  In the latest IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2016, Ireland is ranked 7th (out of 61 economies assessed), an improvement of 9 places from last year.  This is a significant improvement on 2011 when Ireland was ranked 24th, and represents Ireland&rsquo;s highest ranking since 2001.  Based on this report, Ireland is now the most competitive country in the Euro area and 3rd most competitive in the EU28.  The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Report provides an assessment of the factors driving productivity and prosperity across 140 countries.  In the 2015-16 report, Ireland is ranked 24th - an improvement of 1 place from last year, and up from 29th place in 2011.</p><p>Good regulation provides a stable base for economic activity and a level playing field for business, while also protecting workers, consumers and the environment.  The goal of Better Regulation Policy is to ensure that the processes for generating new regulation, and for evaluating existing regulation, are as effective and efficient as possible.  Regulation should achieve the policy goals underpinning it in the least costly manner possible, without undermining the protections that regulation provides.</p><p>To this end, my Department has worked for several years to identify administrative burdens on business and to reduce them wherever possible.  Between 2008 and 2012, a project, driven by my Department, identified administrative costs faced by business arising from regulation across Government.  My Department, the CSO, Revenue and the Department of Transport all met or exceeded the 25% reduction target that was set, and a reduction of more than 20% was achieved across Departments reducing the cost of administrative burdens for business by almost &euro;320 million annually.</p><p>Since 2005, the High Level Group on Business Regulation, and its predecessor, the Business Regulation Forum, have worked directly with business and union representatives to identify the most important regulatory burdens faced by business and to find solutions, simplifications and clarifications from the relevant Departments, Offices and Agencies.</p><p>Other measures taken by my Department include:</p><p>- Reducing the time taken by businesses to find out about the regulations that affect them by developing the businessregulation.ie portal, accessible from the front page of my Department&rsquo;s website, under the heading Making it Easier for Business;</p><p>- Running seven Taking Care of Business events, where up to thirty public bodies come together for a free half-day event to provide information and advice to more than 2,000 business people to date;</p><p>- Developing an Integrated Licensing Application Portal to help reduce the regulatory burden on the enterprise sector through the provision of a single portal for applying for, and renewing, a multiplicity of licences;</p><p>- Consolidating 17 Companies Acts into one in 2014, making it easier to operate a company in Ireland, reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and making company law obligations easier to understand; and</p><p>- The Workplace Relations Reform Programme, has led to the establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission to deliver a world-class workplace relations service and employment rights framework by merging the activities of several existing Bodies of First Instance and all existing appellate functions into an expanded Labour Court.</p></reply>

This was the first exchange of offers since 2004.  Significantly, and following representations made to the EU Commission by Ireland and other Member States, a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) for beef was excluded from the offer.  Both sides will now examine the respective offers in more detail.  The EU and Mercosur will hold a chief negotiators meeting before the summer break in order to take stock of the negotiation and to prepare a schedule of meetings for the second semester of the year.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has long been a supporter an open trade agenda.  However, it is essential for Ireland, and indeed other Member States, to have full information so as to be able to assess the potential impacts, both positive and negative, from the various elements of any perspective agreement, to enable us to calibrate our position in the negotiations.  Ireland, like a number of other Member States has very strong concerns in relation to agriculture to the EU beef sector, in particular.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the inclusion of a TRQ would have been extremely unhelpful at this early stage of the negotiations and should only be considered as part of the &ldquo;end game&rdquo;, given the sensitivity of the issue.  Furthermore, the cumulative impact of all the EU beef offers in Trade Agreements, both those completed and in development, will need to be assessed before a full evaluation of an offer to Mercosur, for this sector, can be considered. </p>  <p>  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, trade barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur countries.  The EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement should reduce the cost of goods exported to the region which will make imports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish goods.  As in all the EU&rsquo;s modern Trade Agreements, the agreement will seek to make the trading environment transparent and more predictable, with common rules and access to public procurement markets.</p></reply>

Almost half (49%) of Irish exports outside of the EU end up in the US, compared to the combined average of 16% for all Member States.  25% of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland comes from the US.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  This will build on our already rewarding economic relationship.  It will also generate new opportunities to create employment and continue to grow our economy.  Studies have shown that the benefits to Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  </p>  <p>  The Copenhagen Economic Report (2013) suggested that an ambitious EU-US Trade Agreement could boost GDP by 1.1%, grow Irish exports by almost 4%, increase investment by 1.5%, and increase real wages by 1.5%.  It estimates a jobs gain of somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs could be created.  The study predicts new opportunities for many Irish industry sectors including pharmaceuticals and chemicals, Agri-food (notably dairy and processed food), insurance and machinery.  The findings are backed up in a comprehensive independent report contracted by the EU Commission, carried out by Ecorys Consultancy and published on 13th May 2016.  The report estimates that a comprehensive EU-US trade agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4 per cent.</p></reply>

The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland.  It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts.  There are regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and When&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two.  If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL.  Therefore, it was essential to seek the views of stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department sought submissions from interested parties by way of a Public Consultation. A large number of submissions were received in response to the consultation.  The responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations as made by UL.  These responses require, and are currently being given, careful consideration by my Department.  The study and the responses to it will be considered by Government with a view to agreeing the actions that should be taken. </p></reply>

Since then there has been a gradual recovery, with the figure reaching 52.9% in the first quarter of 2016.</p>  <p>  Female participation rates have historically been relatively low in Ireland, even prior to the last economic downturn.  Quality affordable childcare is seen as the single greatest obstacle to increasing the participation rate.  The Programme for a Partnership Government agreed in May that childcare will not just be a priority for my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but across government.  The Programme commits the Government to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare in private and community settings, consistent with the principle of ongoing professionalisation of the sector.  In addition the Pathways to work Strategy 2016-2020 includes a commitment to increase access to quality and affordable childcare for parents transitioning to employment.  This strategy also confirms that in addition to focusing on people who are registered as unemployed, activation during a period of economic growth and recovery may seek to encourage other &lsquo;non-active&rsquo; cohorts to participate in the labour market. This may be by means of supportive services (training, job search assistance, financial incentives etc.), by means of increased conditionality in relation to welfare entitlement or by a combination of both. Other efforts under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also referred to part-time underemployment.  There has been a strong downward trend in the figures for part-time underemployment in recent years.  After peaking at over 150,000 in 2012, this shrank to 99,100 in the first quarter of 2016. Significantly fewer people are now in a position where they would accept more work if it was available. </p></reply>

The report stated that, overall, HIQA found standards across all three areas of residential, foster care and child protection to be good.  There was professional social work practice with children and families in foster care and the child welfare and protection services.  HIQA identified that Tusla required more social workers and needed to increase standardisation of services around the country to ensure that all children received an equitable provision of care.  The report also noted the need for continuing development of national policies and ICT projects. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided Tusla with funding of over &euro;676 million in 2016 - this is an increase of &euro;38 million on the provision for 2015 and this increase was widely acknowledged as representing a significant strengthening of Tusla&rsquo;s base funding level.  The additional resources provided gives the Agency greater capacity to recruit social workers and other staff and to respond to identified risk and address areas of unmet need.</p>  <p>  It is a positive sign that HIQA inspectors found that staff responded to the needs of children and focused on their rights and welfare.  Children were encouraged to take part in decisions on their care, had access to advocates and were helped to keep positive attachments with their families.  Children told inspectors that their lives had improved through contact with child protection social workers.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue its recruitment campaign to recruit the social work and social care staff to support families and to protect vulnerable children.  The majority of HIQA findings related to standards that were deemed to require improvement.</p>  <p>  Tusla reports to my Department on the action plans they have put in place following inspections to deal with problems and areas needing quality improvement. </p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged in a programme of service reform to ensure that a consistent quality of care is available to children and families across the country.  I am confident that this process and the major recruitment campaign currently underway, will see a significant improvement in all child welfare and protection services.</p></reply>

It is recognised that, from time to time, individual cases can occupy a disproportionate amount of resources.  The caseload management system gives managers a clearer insight into the pressures on staff.  My Department continues to monitor the number of cases that are reported as awaiting the allocation of a social worker.  The additional staff being recruited and the caseload management system will make an improvement in these figures. </p><p>The total number of additional social workers needed to deal with unallocated cases and keep within the caseload management system was estimated at 268, based on investment required over the next three years.  At the end of March 2016, there were 1503.67 whole time equivalent social workers within Tusla.  However, exact figures on the ratio of social workers to cases is not available, as these social workers work on a range of teams including Child Welfare &amp;amp; Protection Duty/Intake, Ongoing Child Protection work, Children in Care and Foster Care.  A small number of social workers work in Adoption and other areas.</p><p>Tusla has been provided with additional funding of &euro;38m in Budget 2016, including funding of over &euro;6 million to reduce the number of cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.  As part of its Business Plan for this year, Tusla has committed to a number of key targets to be achieved by the end of 2016.  These targets include a 60% decrease of cases awaiting allocation; reducing the number of high priority cases awaiting allocation to less than 5% of the total number of unallocated cases; and ensuring that all children in foster care and residential care have an allocated social worker.  Tusla has made progress in its targets.  </p><p>The table below shows the number of cases allocated to a dedicated social worker between the 31st of December 2013 and the 31st March 2016, broken down by area level.

My Department is aware of the difficulties the closures of the three Tic Toc Nursery Services have imposed on families and on staff who work there.</p>  <p>  My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees around Ireland to assist both parents and childcare providers in matters relating to childcare.  In response to the closure of Tic Toc, Limerick County Childcare Committee immediately carried out an assessment of local availability of childcare places in other services in the proximity of the affected services and it is working with parents to assist them in making alternative childcare arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Department understands that all children registered in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) free pre-school year at the three Tic Toc services have received their full entitlement for the 2015-2016 year.  This represents the vast majority of children registered in the impacted services.</p>  <p>  My Department is keen to ensure that the areas served by the Tic Toc facilities continue to have access to childcare.  Where it is possible for replacement services to be established at, or close to, the sites in question, my Department, the CCC and Pobal will provide all possible assistance to potential new management.  My Department understands that some preliminary discussions have already taken place in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the childcare sector to prepare for the significant expansion to pre-school provision under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme announced in Budget 2016, commencing September 2016.  The Department is in the process of rolling out a number of measures to increase the supply of ECCE places across Ireland from that time.  This expansion will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  From September 2016 both the standard and higher rates of capitation for the ECCE programme will increase by &euro;2 per child, per week; and the rules relating to higher capitation rates will also be reformed to enable more services to benefit from the higher rate.</p>  <p>  My Department made detailed information available to the CCCs at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in September 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.  The Department is working closely with the CCCs, including Limerick, to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand, and to develop action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply may be identified.</p></reply>

Additional funding was provided by the Health Service Executive (&euro;60,000), the Family Support Agency (&euro;90,000) and Ballymun Regeneration (&euro;90,000).  This service was established on a pilot basis in 2011.  Based on international experience, the intention was to test a model of service aimed at meeting the needs of children whose parents are separated and/or who are in care regarding contact with the non-custodial parent(s).  The funding provided allowed the service to operate on a pilot basis in three locations in Dublin i.e. Ballymun, Clondalkin and Tallaght. </p>  <p>  The pilot project was due to close at the end of July 2013.  However, following successful engagement by Barnardos and One Family with the Family Support Agency (FSA) and other funders, additional funding was allocated to allow the service continue to December 2013.  The Family Support Agency provided an additional &euro;31,800 in this regard.  Due to budget restrictions, the FSA were unable to continue funding the service beyond December 2013.  Currently Family Resource Centres are used as venues for such contact and arrangements are made locally.  Unfortunately, due to the constraints of the Family Resource Centre Programme budget for 2016, it was not possible to commit funding to the Barnardos/One Family Child Contact Centres this year.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the families to be targeted included those involved in private family law proceedings or otherwise experiencing family breakdown as well as families where there were disputes regarding contact between non-custodial parents.  The final evaluation report recommended that an integrated response by my Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, supported by their relevant agencies (i.e. The Child and Family Agency, the Courts Service, the Probation Service, the Legal Aid Board, the Family Mediation Service and COSC) would be the best approach to progressing the recommendations.  I intend raising the matter with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality to suggest we review the evaluation report in light of the changing infrastrucutural arrangements such as the establishment of Tusla and the proposed Family Courts Service and to examine the potential for advancing further consideration of the Final Evaluation Report's recommendations in that context.</p></reply>

Pobal works closely with this Department in implementing these programmes and undertakes a compliance process to verify, through on-site visits, that the conditions of the various programmes are being complied with.  Pobal also carries out audits at the request of the Department. </p>  <p>  Following an audit of the West Clare Early Years (WCEY) Group, Pobal submitted a report to West Clare Early Years (WCEY) in November 2015.  This report identified major governance issues and the need for repayment of over-claimed childcare funding.  The Board of WCEY accepted the findings of the report and, at a meeting with Pobal on February 10th, agreed to prepare an action plan to resolve the situation.  However, the Board of WCEY subsequently took a decision on February 13th to liquidate the company and to close the childcare services under its management with immediate effect.  Neither the Department nor Pobal were consulted about the decision to liquidate. </p>  <p>  Since that time, Pobal and Clare County Childcare Committee have been working intensively on behalf of my Department to implement sustainable solutions that will restore childcare provision in West Clare.  As a result of this collaborative engagement, the majority of these services have now re-opened.  Details surrounding the re-opening of services are as follows:</p>  <p> - Kilmihill Community Development School - opened 14 March 2016 with ECCE and CCS children in attendance and they have received payments in respect of both programmes. </p>  <p> - Kildysart Kidz - opened 4 April 2016 and they have received payment is respect of ECCE, CEC and CCS programmes.</p>  <p> - Lissycasey Laugh and Learn - opened 12 April 2016 and they have received payments in respect of ECCE and CCS programmes.</p>  <p> - Cairde Beaga Kilrush/ Cairde Beaga Kilkee (Both under Clare Local Development Company - CLDC) - Opened 13 June 2016.  ECCE, CCS and TEC contracts for CLDC have been activated.</p>  <p>  It has been agreed that services may extend their ECCE provision so that all children may avail of their full entitlement for the 2015/2016 year (i.e. 183 days).</p>  <p>  In addition, an addendum to the Clare County Childcare Committee contract, for intensive support work with the West Clare services, was agreed to ensure services had the appropriate level of assistance during the early stages of service restoration.</p></reply>

While members of the Defence Forces are encouraged to present to the military medical system, they may opt to present to a civilian general practitioner who may not be aware that they are a member of the Defence Forces.
