    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200062#WRA01300"><p>I am aware of the issue regarding the provision of affordable studio space, particularly in Dublin as a result of the changing property market.Â  In general, I would consider that local approaches driven by artists, local arts officers are best suited to respond to the specific local circumstances involved and provide the most effective outcomes.  However, my Department is in discussion with the Arts Council, Dublin City Council and the OPW to consider some possible short-term and longer-term approaches to the issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of practical responses, I recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for 56 arts and culture centres across the country.  Eight of these grants relate to artist studios and creative spaces amounting to a total of   &euro;850,000.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s initiative on the North East Inner City, I also awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 last year to Fire Station Artists' Studios, Buckingham Street, to assist in providing additional studio space in conjunction with Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  I will shortly be announcing a new capital grants Scheme which will provide grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.  Organisations with artists' studios will also be eligible to apply under this Scheme. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework for planning is a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  However in general, as I stated above, I would consider it more appropriate for local authorities to determine their own needs rather than mandating strict national quotas which may not be appropriate.</p>  <p>  The issue of whether any additional guidance would be of assistance will be kept under review in light of the work which is currently being undertaken by my Department and the Arts Council.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s <i>Culture Ireland</i>programme in particular will promote Irish culture on the world stage.  The <i>Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme</i>last year facilitated a heightened sense of shared identity and pride of country.  Following on from this the Taoiseach and I recently launched the <i>Creative Ireland Programme </i>as the Government's legacy programme &ndash; a five year initiative, from 2017 to 2022 which places creativity at the centre of public policy. </p><p>This is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  This will focus on boosting cultural provision and participation in communities and harnessing the goodwill and engagement generated by the 2016 commemorative programme. </p><p>The core proposition of this programme is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.  The programme is based on five pillars:</p><p>-  Enabling the creative potential of every child</p><p>-  Enabling creativity in every community</p><p>-  Investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure</p><p>-  Establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production</p><p>-  Unifying our global reputation</p><p>I am confident that this programme will be very beneficial in promoting the national image at home and abroad and in increasing interest in cultural and heritage matters amongst young people.</p></reply>

In this respect, they can use funding available from within their local authority including funds that may be available from the Arts Council or Heritage Council.</p><p>In this context Pillar 2 of the <i>Creative Ireland Programme</i>- <i>Enabling creativity in every community,</i>aims to empower local authorities to lead the engagement of citizens with our arts, culture and heritage.  All local authorities now have Culture Teams in place and are developing their Culture and Creativity Plans for 2017.</p><p>Many of the Culture and Creativity plans which are currently being prepared contain objectives to preserve historical records and photographs For example, Donegal County Council is mounting a free exhibition on the Vanished World of the landed gentry of Donegal using never before seen documents, photo albums and letters from the collections of the Archives Service.  South Dublin County Council will be digitising the Corkagh papers which relate to the Finlay and Colley families of Corkagh Demesne in Clondalkin while Wexford County Council are digitising the archives of a prominent shipping company in New Ross. </p><p>These are just some of the projects that are being included around the county to preserve historical photographs and records.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200062#WRA02000"><p>My role, as Minister, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a Conservation Plan for the project mentioned by the Deputy was launched in February and that the group are now seeking to employ a full time administrator.  While my Department recognises the significance and value of this project, and congratulates the group on their work to date, I regret that there is currently no funding available from my Department to pay the salary of an administrator. </p>  <p>  The best advice for the group may be to contact the local authority conservation officer and heritage officer, who are best placed to advise the group on the various types of funding available.  I understand the project group has been successful in obtaining grant support from the Heritage Council (which my Department funds) in recent years for a community event and also for development of their Conservation Plan. </p>  <p>I also understand that a member of the group has contacted the LEADER Local Action Group regarding LEADER funding for the project, however, no formal application for funding has yet been lodged.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that LEADER funding would not cover the costs incurred in providing a full time administrator for a project although other elements of the project may be eligible for funding. The approval of LEADER funding, or otherwise, for the project would be a matter for the LEADER Local Action Group. </p>  <p>  Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings, including the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. These schemes are administered via the local authorities and details can be found on all local authority websites.</p></reply>

The habitats adjacent to the borrow pit include willow scrub, and roadside margin vegetation.  There is no woodland, active blanket bog, or other Special Area of Conservation qualifying interest habitats at this location.  The site is used temporarily to store large boulders and other building material for works necessary within the managed zone of the National Park.  Examples of such works include rock armour and surface dressing of internal roads and car parks, trench works in or around the many buildings&rsquo; yards and gardens within the park.  The temporary storage of such materials facilitates efficient reuse of natural materials within the managed zone of the Park and minimises the need to import such material from elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The material currently temporarily stored at t he site is both stable and inactive.  My understanding is that it does not represent an environmental threat. Â It should be noted however that it is intended to remove the material in the near future as part of the park works programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200062#WRA02400"><p>The Killarney House project involves collaboration between my Department, the Office of Public Works (as project managers for the construction) and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Department first announced the project in 2011 with a budget of &euro;10m (F&aacute;ilte Ireland have committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its Tourism Capital Investment Programme).</p>  <p>  The National Tourism Authority&rsquo;s significant financial contribution to the project is a clear statement of its confidence that this project will make a significant contribution in the future to the South West&rsquo;s tourism offering.  I am confident that the development will enhance the potential of Killarney House as a top class visitor and heritage tourism centre.  It will do this in parallel with respecting its prime focus as a visitor centre for Killarney National Park and by developing its status as a heritage property managed by the Department.</p>  <p>  In 2016 it was decided to pursue the opening of Killarney House and Gardens on a phased basis.  The House is being developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the National Park, highlighting the beauty and interpreting the richness and significance of the Park&rsquo;s landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of interaction with the Park over the centuries.  Some of the formal rooms are currently being restored to their former glory.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the House have been restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the Park and which will provide vistas linking the town to the scenery of mountain, woods and lakelands. These gardens opened in April 2016.</p>  <p>  The completion of the Historic rooms and the Interpretative Exhibition is being prioritised in 2017.  I intend to open the Historic Rooms during the summer and in this context preparatory works on the restoration and refurbishment of the furniture collection for their display, are significantly advanced.  The exhibition phase of the project is advancing and I expect that the various elements of works will be completed this year.  It is intended that these amenities will be open to the public as soon as it is completed.   </p>  <p>  Visitors to Killarney usually stay in the town and visit other locations and attractions within the immediate area or in the wider region.  The length of stay tends to be quite short and in the case of some, bus tours may consist of just one night.  Often a visit will be confined to Muckross House which focuses on cultural heritage and many tourists will leave Killarney unaware of the true extent and beauty of the National Park that surrounds them.  When completed, Killarney House will showcase Killarney National Park from both a cultural and natural heritage point of view and will only serve to benefit tourists and local businesses.</p></reply>

No. 477/2011), which together provide the legislative framework on invasive alien species issues.</p><p>In 2014, a new EU Regulation on invasive alien species (no. 1143/2014) came into force and my Department is the lead authority with respect to the adoption of the provisions of that Regulation and in transposing the Regulation into domestic law.  Comprehensive new national Regulations in relation to invasive alien species are being drafted in my Department at this time.</p><p><i>It is currently an offence to introduce or spread Rhododendron ponticum, the widespread invasive form, under Regulation </i>49 of the 2011 Birds and Natural Habitats Regulations. </p><p>Regulation 50 makes it an offence to import, buy, sell, breed, transport and distribute listed animal or plant species or vector material. However it has become clear that this must be cleared with the EU as being in compliance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in regard to the free movement of goods within the Union, and this will be done as part of the work on the new legislation being drafted in my Department.</p><p>It is therefore my intention as soon as practicable to ban the sale of <i>Rhododendron ponticum </i>in Ireland.</p><p>I would like to stress that there are over a thousand species of <i>Rhododendron, </i>as well as a huge number of varieties, and very few of these are thought to be capable of spreading into the wild in Ireland.  Many species and varieties of <i>Rhododendron</i>are sold in Ireland and are economically important in the horticulture sector, but there is no reliable data to show if there is a significant trade in the invasive <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>.</p><p>However, officials from my Department are working on an on-going basis with the National Biodiversity Data Centre to monitor reports of the sale of <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>in Ireland and develop a clearer picture of the extent of the issue and assess what resources are required, with a view to dealing with this satisfactorily in the context of the new legislation and bring about more effective control.</p><p>The new invasive alien species legislation currently being drafted in my Department will, <i>inter alia</i>, deal with the issue of trade in invasive species as envisaged under Regulation 50 of the 2011 Birds and Habitats Regulations, subject to our obligations under the TFEU.</p></reply>

This capital scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through Creative Ireland and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme was considerably over-subscribed. The Department received 106 applications in total under Stream 1 and 2 seeking total funding of over &euro;20m with eligible requests for funding totalling over &euro;14.6m.  The detailed selection criteria and eligibility requirements were published in the Guidelines of the Scheme. <b></b>There was a two stage assessment process.  The first stage involved all applications being reviewed on receipt to ensure eligibility.<b></b>All eligible applications were then forwarded to an Assessment Panel which undertook the second stage of the assessment of the applications which advanced from stage one.  The Assessment Panel reviewed each eligible application within the defined criteria and scored them accordingly.  The recommendations were then forwarded to me for decision as set out in the published scheme conditions.<b></b>Following these assessment processes, 56 projects are being funded.  Seven flagship projects will receive substantial funding allocations while a further 49 projects will receive funding ranging from &euro;20,000 to &euro;276,000.  Full details of these can be found on my Departments website.</p><p>I will be opening a further Stream of funding under this Scheme shortly.  It will provide small capital grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.  While the amounts involved are relatively modest, the grants will in themselves make a huge difference to individual organisations and will be of particular benefit to local cultural centres throughout rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The primary responsibility in terms of fire fighting lies with the Fire Service and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  With regard to gorse fires in particular, my Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group that explores issues surrounding such fires.Â  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on the Group and leads any criminal investigation.  My Department, of course, cooperates fully with any Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies.  The main source of wild gorse fires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.Â  Aside from such malicious activities, one of the main challenges is to encourage members of the public, (including landowners, farmers and recreational users of publicly accessible land), to act responsibly at all times, to be mindful of their own safety and the safety of others, to be mindful of the need to protect property, both publicly owned and privately owned and to appreciate the value of our natural heritage, particularly in our National Parks, Nature Reserves and Designated (Natura 2000) Sites.</p><p>With regard to the National Parks in particular, on an on-going basis, officials from my Department are in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Service.

For example, the Plan includes a commitment that no small school will close against the wishes of parents; it also sets out a number of actions in relation to access to healthcare, including an increase in the number of GPs in rural areas. </p><p>Our towns and villages are the heart of our rural communities, and it is important that we implement measures to help breath life back into these rural towns and villages.  The rejuvenation of towns and villages will be supported under the Action Plan through schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the CL&Aacute;R Programme, both of which were launched in the last number of weeks.</p><p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme will support the rejuvenation of up to 300 rural towns and villages through an investment of &euro;20 million over the next 15 months.Minister of State Ring announced an allocation of &euro;5 million for the CL&Aacute;R Programme this year.  Both schemes are open for applications through the Local Authorities.</p><p>The actions set out in the Action Plan for Rural Development are the start of an on-going process which will be built on continuously to unlock the potential of rural Ireland and improve the lives of people who live and work in rural communities.</p></reply>

I am delighted to be able to say that tomorrow I expect to announce a significant investment in both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund for 2017.  These will now support a large number of projects across every local authority area in the country.   </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  Structures must be on the local authority Record of Protected Structures.  The fund, administered through the local authorities, seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost. Â  </p>  <p>  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures (i.e. structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures).  The scheme supports heritage projects across the country in and creates employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The administration of both schemes is devolved to local authorities who are contacting successful applicants in the coming days.  A circular outlining the terms of each scheme can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website. Any queries about the operation of the schemes should be directed to the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

It should be noted that under section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003 the Council is independent of the Minister in its funding decisions. </p>  <p>  Members of Aosd&aacute;na can qualify for a means-tested payment known as the Cnuas if they are resident in Ireland and are full-time practising artists.</p>  <p>  Following recent internal audits of Aosd&aacute;na and a Value for Money Policy Review of the Arts Council - which was undertaken under the guidance of an expert Steering Committee chaired by Dr. John O&rsquo;Hagan, Professor of Economics at Trinity College - the Arts Council is reviewing all aspects of the administration and procedures of Aosd&aacute;na to ensure the most appropriate governance and oversight arrangements are in place. Â    </p>  <p>  In regard to any issues which arise from the review of the Aosd&aacute;na, these are a matter for the Arts Council and Aosd&aacute;na and I would encourage dialogue between the parties to resolve them.</p></reply>

For the 2011 census there were two new questions and changes to eight other questions.  The 2016 census on the other hand was run as a &lsquo;no change&rsquo; census, meaning the questions on the form were the same as those used in 2011 with the exception of the question on marital status.  New questions, or changes to existing questions, must be tested in advance to ensure they will provide meaningful results and be well understood by the public.  However, given the budgetary circumstances that pertained during the planning phase of the 2016 census it was not possible to pursue this route and accordingly the &lsquo;no change&rsquo; census option was implemented.</p>  <p>  The ethnicity question, therefore, has remained unchanged since 2006. </p>  <p>  The question has come in for criticism, by both individuals and various bodies. While information collected from the question in previous censuses has been beneficial to data users, the CSO accepts that the question as presently composed falls short of what could be expected in today&rsquo;s multiracial Ireland. It is anticipated that in advance of the next census a full public consultation on the questions to be asked will be conducted, followed by a pilot test and consideration by an Expert Group. It is expected that the requirement for and formulation of the ethnicity question will be critically reviewed as part of that exercise.</p></reply>

The deployment of Garda resources for events is commensurate with the risk level assigned to each event. </p><p>In relation to the role of the Defence Forces, I understand that among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence 2015 is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. I am advised that there are regular coordination and liaison meetings that take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p><p>I am also advised that planning for an event includes liaison with the local transport service providers, to ensure sufficient transport is in place given the high volumes of persons anticipated to be attending such events, with assurances being provided that additional transport would be provided for the event and would be available afterwards to transport all concerned as quickly as possible to dissipate any threat of possible associated violence.</p><p>Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has in place a network of CCTV systems that are planned and implemented in light of identified operational needs and priorities.

This major investment will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.</p></reply>

It is a service designed to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons.  The Garda National Vetting Bureau carries out this function in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present, 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda National Vetting Bureau in under five working days.  This represents a significant improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013. This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80 percent in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April last year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 and in tandem with that, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-vetting system. E-vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  The e-vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-vetting system to do so.</p>  <p>  Processing times for any given application can be longer in individual cases when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to estimate in advance the number of applications that may be processed overall or in respect of a particular group, I would not that note that in recent years in excess of 350,000 vetting applications have been processed per annum by the Garda authorities.</p></reply>

This is done by using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001). Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. In line with best international practice, the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem.</p>  <p>  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties. Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates. </p>  <p>  While the revaluation programme has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2016, some 3,297 applications for revision were processed. Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area. As already mentioned revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. </p>  <p>  It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis with all Local Authorities. To this effect, the Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service.  During 2016, the Valuation Office&rsquo;s new approach based on more extensive data sharing was rolled out with all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes which was jointly conducted by the Institute of Revenue Rating and Valuation (IRRV) and the International Property Tax Institute (IPTI). That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice and which are based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions. These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan which is being put in place by the Valuation Office. The review also proposed, among other recommendations, the establishment of a separate, permanently resourced Revision Unit which would be responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.    </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following the receipt of a business case from the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of a dedicated Unit to deal specifically with the ongoing revision programme, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the budgetary provisions for 2017, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 to the Valuation Office for this purpose.  This development, which involves the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to Local Authorities and ratepayers into the future.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, in the case of documentation issued in Afghanistan, it is particularly difficult to carry out the necessary verification checks.  It is also the case that Ireland does not have a diplomatic or consular presence in that country.  Indeed, such verification difficulties in Afghanistan have also been highlighted by EU member states in the context of Local Schengen co-operation meetings noting ongoing concerns there in relation to the accuracy of requested documentation in support of visa applications. </p>  <p>  As the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi has been assigned responsibility for diplomatic and consular matters with Afghanistan, visa applications from that country are processed in the Visa Office there.  In an effort to mitigate the difficulties in carrying out in-country verification checks in Afghanistan, and to provide some assurances as to the authenticity of certain official documents, the requirements outlined have been put in place and will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  As with all visa services in all countries worldwide, the central concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time not placing unnecessary or unreasonable obstacles in the way of those who intend travelling for legitimate purposes and who are likely to abide by the terms of their visa. The verification and authentication requirements in place are appropriate in the circumstances. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division.</p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Cavan / Monaghan Division, on 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 321. There are also<b></b>13 Garda Reserves and 36 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing well. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 21 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan / Monaghan Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan / Monaghan Division in the coming years. </p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing well. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of which 33 were assigned to the DMR West Division, in 2016 and 23 in 2017. I understand that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda and Reserve strength of Rathcoole, Clondalkin, Lucan and Ronanstown Garda Station, including the number of Community Garda&iacute; is as set out in the tables.  </p><p><b>Garda Strength 31 March 2017</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Garda</th><th>Community  Garda</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>81</td><td>7</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>67</td><td>6</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>82</td><td>9</td><td>91</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 31 March 2017</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Rathcoole</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Lucan</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Ronanstown</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This comprehensive operation has been rolled out nationwide, including in the Rathcoole area, and is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including the recently announced additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million in 2017.  The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  The operation has led to concentrated Garda activity with more than 52,400 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 74,300 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner and her management team who are responsible for the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, as well as for policing strategies in  particularly localities, and I have no direct role in these matters.  However, it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the Operation, the burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016, which were released recently, show a<b></b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor. </p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.</p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300, and in this regard I was pleased to be able to launch a new recruitment campaign for Reserve members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;narecently.</p></reply>

This is one the main statutory functions of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The revaluation programme is the first of its kind since the mid-nineteenth century and has been a policy objective of successive governments for several decades.  The programme has gained considerable momentum following the enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the costs incurred in the period 2005 to 2014 in respect of the revaluation programme was &euro;33 million.  The estimation of the costs incurred for 2015 and 2016 is of the order of &euro;8 million in total.  The estimated cost to date of the national revaluation programme is, therefore &euro;41 million.  I am advised that the estimated costs to date are apportioned on a pro-rata basis for the various work programmes undertaken by the Valuation Office, including ongoing statutory and non-statutory work carried out by the Office and that these estimates are derived from the overall expenditure incurred in running the Valuation Office, taking account of staffing and other relevant costs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing costs of an organisation such as the Valuation Office would typically account for 75 - 80% of the total cost of running the organisation.</p>  <p>  In calculating the approximate costs associated with the REVAL 2017 phase of the programme, the estimation of costs for work completed for that project in 2016, including salary costs, is &euro;4.5 million.  The Deputy will be aware that the 2015 Act has enabled the Valuation Office to adopt a series of new approaches to revaluation not supported by the previous legislation, including the outsourcing of work, the use of "self assessment" principles known as "Occupier Assisted Valuation" and more extensive use of statistical analysis.  These are being piloted during the REVAL 2017 phase of the overall programme.  Accordingly, the costs for the period 2017 and 2018, to the anticipated completion of REVAL 2017, and the costs arising until the anticipated completion of the overall national revaluation programme in 2021, are likely to be significantly determined by the success or otherwise of these pilot projects and the Valuation Office is not in a position to provide an estimate of such costs until the outcome of these pilot projects is apparent.</p></reply>

The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300, and in this regard I was pleased to be able to launch a new recruitment campaign for Reserve members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;narecently.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

This involved consultation with a representative group of residents, a number of residents volunteering to participate in live shopping expeditions, an examination of the household shopping basket for families and single persons, an examination of responses to questionnaires completed by all residents on the range and type of foodstuffs they would like to be made available and an analysis of the findings of the Safe Food Report 'What is the cost of a healthy food basket in the Republic of Ireland in 2016?'.  This analysis led to the allocation of a weekly number of points to each adult and child resident in the centre.  These points are then used to obtain fresh food and other products in the Food Hall.  As a result, parents are now able to cook food in their own accommodation for their own families.  The Food Hall is open six days a week and stock is replenished as required.  Ethnically appropriate foods and spices are also available.  Non-standard items can be ordered in and made available the following day provided such items can be sourced from traceable suppliers. </p><p>The number of points awarded to family members and groups are set by RIA and are as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Point Per Person/Child</th><th>Aggregate Points Per Family</th></tr><tr><td>First Adult in Family</td><td>62 points per week</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Second Adult in Family</td><td>25 points per week</td><td>87 points per week</td></tr><tr><td>Third Adult in Family</td><td>31 points per week</td><td>118 points per week</td></tr><tr><td>Fourth Adult in Family</td><td>25 points per week</td><td>143 points per week</td></tr><tr><td>Fifth Adult in Family</td><td>31 points per week</td><td>174 points per week</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Children </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age 0-5 years</td><td>15.5 point per week</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Age 6 &ndash; 14</td><td>19 points per week</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Children aged over 15</td><td>Same as second and subsequent adults in the family</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The points applied to each item are also determined by RIA in full consultation with management at the centre in question.  It is my intention that the same level of points will be applied to comparable items in all centres in which this system will be implemented across the country.</p><p>There are a number of important issues that need to be stated in relation to the points.  There is no monetary equivalent for a point and points cannot be purchased for cash.  These points are only used for the acquisition of food and essential supplies.  All utility bills such as light and heat, laundry costs, organised transport etc are provided from within the existing contract and residents are not charged for these services.  It is also important to note that the system is under continuous review and is still a work in progress.</p><p>The system is being monitored by RIA and feedback from this project along with other similar projects due to commence soon will continue to inform the operation of the points system.  Practical issues arising from its roll-out elsewhere will continue to apprise and advise its operation.  </p><p>Deputies in this house have, in the past, raised concerns about protection applicants not being able to cook for themselves.  It is for this reason, and on foot of the McMahon Report, that the Government sought to address this issue in the Programme for Government.  This project is in the vanguard of the roll-out a system of home cooking for residents in all family centres and addressing Deputies' concerns.  I am satisfied that this system will continue to meet the reasonable needs of residents and allow them to provide for their families.</p><p>Let us not forget that the introduction and implementation of this new system has been welcomed by residents and has already had a very positive impact on the atmosphere right through the centre.  Residents are free to cook what they want and when they want.  The introduction of the system addresses one of the key recommendations of the McMahon report in that children will now see their parents cook a meal for their family.  This pilot project has been a great success and it is intended that this system or variations thereof will be rolled out to other family centres throughout the country. </p></reply>

Applications processed in the seven Visa Offices abroad generally have a shorter processing time.</p><p>The Policy Document on Family Reunification published in December, 2013 contains a stated business target that visa applications to join Irish citizens should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application.  However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.</p><p>While the Visa Office endeavours to have applications of this nature processed as quickly as possible, processing times for visas can vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, individual circumstances, the complexity of applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.

The Act was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protections available to whistleblowers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure to GSOC, which is a statutorily independent body, for investigation.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.</p>  <p>  The legislation allows that an individual employed by a public body may also make a Protected Disclosure to the Minister with responsibility for that body.  It is the case that in a number of instances I have received such disclosures. It is important to note that in some cases the individuals concerned have indicated that they have already been in contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or GSOC regarding the same matters.</p>  <p>  Since the Act came into effect I have received 8 complaints in which the Protected Disclosures Act has been cited.  These are from individuals who either are, or were, employees/members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of these, 6 were members or retired members and 2 were civilian or former civilian employees.  1 complaint was made in 2015, 3 in 2016 and 4 in 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; or a civilian employee of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The process that applies in my Office to any such correspondence is as follows.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the correspondence is assessed to determine whether it constitutes a Protected Disclosure under the Act.  Secondly, consideration is given to what action is required.  The individual is then informed of what action I propose to take.  All reasonable efforts are taken to keep the identity of the individual concerned confidential. </p>  <p>  Actions taken can include seeking a Garda report from the Garda Commissioner (having first confirmed that the individual is agreeable to that course of action), referring matters to GSOC under powers available to me as Minister under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, referring matters to an external body or person for review, etc.  As the Deputy is aware two such Disclosures received in 2016 were reviewed by Mr Justice O&rsquo;Neill and a Tribunal of Inquiry has been established under Mr Justice Charleton.</p>  <p>  In addition to the cases referred to above there have been a small number of other cases which did not specifically cite the Act, but might be inferred to have been Protected Disclosures.  These have been dealt with in the same way.</p></reply>

Judge McCartan was appointed on 7 March 2017 and officially commenced his new role on 27 March.  The assessment process will be conducted completely independently of Government, and it is hoped that Judge McCartan can conclude his assessment process within 90 days.  The scope of the assessment process is outlined in the D&aacute;il Motion of 26 January 2017. </p>  <p>  Judge McCartan will be assisted by a Junior Counsel.  He will have discretion to afford the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee whatever representation he believes is necessary in order for the Committee to present its evidence to the assessment process.  </p>  <p>  To facilitate the assessment process, office accommodation and meeting facilities have been obtained by the Department of Justice and Equality at the following address: Tom Johnson House (Beggars Bush), Haddington Road, Dublin 4.  An email address has been provided to Judge McCartan and forwarded to the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee for the purposes of facilitating contact between Judge McCartan and the Committee.  However, the Committee has decided not to engage with the Judge to date.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the assessment process, my Department has met and corresponded with the Committee and its advisors on a number of occasions in relation to historical monies that the Committee claims are owed to it.  The Committee believes that the Exchequer should be liable for payment of those monies and has declined to engage with the proposed Judge McCartan process until the historical fees issue is resolved to its satisfaction. </p>  <p>  Discussions to date have not led to a resolution on this issue; however, my Department  remains open to continuing to correspond and meet with the Committee to try to resolve the issue.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Commissioner that as of the 31 March 2017 there were 307 Garda assigned to the Kerry Garda Division of which 105 were assigned to the Killarney District.  There were also 7 Garda Reserves and 7 civilians attached to the Killarney District.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 16 of which were assigned to the Kerry Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation. </p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.</p></reply>

Many courthouses have been improved since the establishment of the Courts Service but in a number of locations work remains to be done.  In some cases this involves building a new courthouse, in other cases it involves refurbishing and extending the existing courthouse.  In all cases it is dependant both on the availability of funding and on the Courts Service's ability to acquire a suitable site on which a new or extended courthouse can be built.  The site acquisition is often a lengthy and complex process as suitable sites are generally not readily available at the required location or at a price that provides value for money.</p>  <p>  Action No. 102 of the Action Plan for Rural Development provides for the construction or redevelopment of seven regional courthouses - with four new courthouses being built in Drogheda, Letterkenny, Limerick and Wexford and substantial refurbishment and extension of existing courthouses in Cork, Mullingar and Waterford.  Funding was made available for the Justice sector under the Government's 2012 Capital Investment Programme.  The Deputy will recall that I announced the signing of the PPP contract for the seven courthouses in December 2015.  The Courts Service has advised that the selection methodology used by the Courts Service Building Committee was such that priority was given to provincial city and county town locations where investment in courthouse facilities was urgently required and where the Courts Service was in a position to commence work at short notice due to the availability of suitable sites.  The Courts Service has further advised that work is progressing well at the seven courthouse sites and all projects will be completed by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

A Register requesting public pledges went live onthe Irish Red Cross website (<i>www.redcross.ie</i>) in late September 2015 to collate offers of housing from the public.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, due to operational difficulties in Italy and Greece, the relocation programme was slow to commence all over the EU and significant numbers of asylum seekers did not begin to arrive in Ireland until late 2016.  Persons in the relocation programme must then have their application for asylum determined which takes around 12 weeks.  It has therefore only been in the last number of months that the numbers of refugees emerging from the relocation programme and available for settlement in communities around Ireland has reached significant numbers.  This number currently stands are 198 and is rapidly increasing.  Most of these refugees will receive accommodation in communities around Ireland through the long established resettlement model run in cooperation with the local authority and funded by my Department.  This model provides for a range of local supports including the appointment by the local authority of a resettlement worker/s.  However, other refugees will also be offered pledged accommodation and services through the Irish Red Cross with the intention of assisting them to move more speedily out of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) into local communities.</p><p>The first relocation group arrived in Ireland in January 2016.  Over the last 12 months the Department of Justice and Equality has been working closely with the Irish Red Cross and during this time the Irish Red Cross has been engaged in a programme of planning and coordination, learning valuable lessons from previous resettlement projects, through engagement with institutions, community groups and Red Cross Movement Partners implementing similar projects in the EU. </p><p>The<b></b>Irish Red Cross<b></b>as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has played an integral role providing a range of vital and lifesaving supports to millions of migrants along the migration trail from Syria, the Middle East and across Europe.  The emblem of the Red Cross is a familiar and trusted sign of humanity and impartiality to many migrants entering Ireland.  Almost without exception those who arrive in  Ireland under the relocation programme will have encountered members of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement on their journey to Ireland.  The role of the Irish Red Cross in providing support at the point of entry in Ireland, supporting resettlement, family tracing, day to day supports at local levels is fundamental to the success of welcoming and creating a sustainable and stable living environment for those seeking refuge. </p><p>The Irish Red Cross received just over 700 pledges of accommodation across 27 counties in Ireland.  Of this figure, the Irish Red Cross currently have 360 active shared accommodation offers, 120 active vacant stand-alone premises and 220 premises that are on hold, either not currently available or not meeting criteria.</p><p>The Irish Red Cross is researching formal processes to secure housing and are engaged in a rigorous housing assessments focusing on 120 vacant stand-alone pledges as part of Phase 1.  Individual property inspections have assessed the suitability and appropriateness of these premises against a number of safety and situational criteria.  Once a property is approved as suitable for housing, the Irish Red Cross are facilitating regulatory agreements with property owners and fitting out the properties to a minimum required standard.</p><p>The Irish Red Cross has been working closely with the IRPP and those who have received refugee status to understand the specific needs and requirements of families and individuals.  With this in mind, placing refugees in any accommodation must take into account a range of personal and social requirements to support connectedness with Irish societal systems for both refugees and local communities and to respect the wishes and cultural aspirations of refugees.  One of the significant challengers in terms of programme design is ensuring that the level of support available to those placed in pledged accommodation is broadly similar to that which pertains under the standard resettlement model.  In addition, many offers of pledged accommodation are time limited which means that refugees will need to move from their pledged accommodation at some point and be placed in alternative accommodation within the community.  This will require careful management to ensure that the ongoing needs of the refugees are met.  Currently<font color="#FF0000"> </font>there are a number of families and individuals who have gained refugee status and of this number the Irish Red Cross are currently placing over 30 clients in pledged accommodation in May and have already placed three families in new homes.  The Irish Red Cross are continuing the wrapping around of social supports linking with official Ireland and encouraging participation and engagement with local communities. </p><p>The Irish Red Cross has been working with the IRPP in the rigorous development of the &lsquo;migration programme&rsquo; which has multidimensional outputs by managing the following activities:</p><p>-  Providing in-kind supports to Syrian families at the air side point of entry working alongside the IRPP and the International Organisation for Migration.  To date, the Irish Red Cross has provided supports to over 382 people arriving on flights into Ireland.</p><p>-  Providing support to migrants to secure medium to long term accommodation in Ireland under the pledged system and/or private rental market.</p><p>-  Facilitating and connecting refugees with necessary social supports and services in Ireland and at community level. (Education, Health, Social Welfare, Employment, English Language Support).</p><p>-  Scaling up the Red Cross volunteer network at county level to support community integration activities; the Irish Red Cross is currently recruiting over 300 volunteers nationwide to support community level integration over the next 24 months and beyond.</p><p>-  Developing and carrying out training on cultural awareness issues and psycho-social supports. </p><p>-  Contributing as a member of Irish Refugee Protection Programme Task force - a cross-departmental and inter-agency Taskforce.</p><p>-  Supporting Family Reunification Travel Assistance and Restoring Family Links for 315 cases in 2015 and 257 cases in 2016.</p><p>-  Scaling up activities in preparation including holding informative regional meetings with its members, pledgers and local NGOs.</p><p>-  IRC is also engaging in dialogue with local authorities and department of housing discussing the possibilities of utilising Housing Assistance Programme (HAP).</p><p>I also understand that the Irish Red Cross is developing a Customer Relationship Management Service which supports the ability to collate all data on pledges and casework in a central location, protecting personal data.  The CRM system also supports accurate reporting enabling the service user, the Irish Red Cross and the IRPP to identify clear and concise outputs and indicators.</p><p>In 2015/2016 the Irish Red Cross received a total of &euro;180,345 from my Department.  This year the amount made available will increase in order to scale up the placement of clients in pledged accommodation together with supporting services.  I anticipate that the amount made available for these purposes over the course of 2017 will be approximately &euro;500,000.  The purpose of the increased sum is to ensure the placement of larger numbers of refugees in pledged accommodation around the State in order to supplement the existing model of resettlement.  It is my intention that this model will be reviewed over the coming twelve months to see how the lessons learned can be applied more broadly, both operationally and in terms of future policy development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.300.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200067#WRF01700"><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017; 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) covers two distinct cohorts - relocation cases from Greece and Italy and resettlement cases from Lebanon - the Deputy's question refers in particular to the former, those arriving from Greece and Italy as relocated asylum seekers. </p>  <p>  The comprehensive reply to Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017 sets out in detail the nature of the integration programmes available to refugees arriving under the resettlement strand of the IRPP.  In relation to the relocation strand of the IRPP, I can inform the Deputy that the integration programmes available to the relocated asylum seekers arriving here will be broadly the same as those for programme refugees, but there may be some small differences arising from the different nature and initial entitlements of this cohort. </p>  <p>  As set out in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 96 of 21 February 2017, work in relation to the arrival of UNHCR programme refugees begins about 9 months in advance of resettlement.  With the relocation cohort this period of advance planning is not available because of the circumstances of the relocation group and the process set out in the relocation instruments.  Instead the IRPP has about 3 months to plan for the arrival of relocated asylum seekers.  When this cohort arrive they do not, as asylum seekers, possess the same rights and entitlements as refugees.  </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the IRPP endeavours to the greatest extent possible to treat families and individuals arriving under the relocation programme in a broadly equivalent manner so as to commence the integration process in the quickest possible time scale.  The IRPP does this as the likelihood of persons in this cohort achieving a grant of international protection is very high because (a) the selection process embedded in the relocation instruments is predicated on the fact that eligible nationalities must, across the EU, have a 75% or higher chance of obtaining status and (b) the overwhelming majority of persons being relocated to Ireland are fleeing the war in Syria. </p>  <p>  In advance of their arrival in Ireland, relocated asylum seekers will have been interviewed while in Greece or Italy by an IRPP team to assess their needs and vulnerabilities prior to arrival in Ireland and to initially orient them to Irish life and society.</p>  <p>  Following their arrival in Ireland, and during their initial period of reception, relocated asylum seekers will be accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country.  In the EROC they will receive broadly the same integration services as available to programme refugees with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection.  This decision is usually forthcoming within twelve weeks.  IRPP staff meet individuals and families at regular intervals to help assess their ongoing needs and requirements. The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.  A Friends of the Centre group has been established in Ballaghaderreen, the newest EROC to be opened and, working with the Irish Red Cross, the IRPP is liaising with volunteers to provide additional supports to facilitate residents as they start the long process of integrating into Irish society.  </p>  <p>  Some of the key features of supports provided to relocated asylum seekers include:</p>  <p>  -  IRPP staff and interpreters meet families and individuals upon arrival at Dublin Airport and accompany them to their Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately six months.  </p>  <p>  -  During the days post arrival the asylum seekers are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and receive an exceptional needs payment (ENP).   -  IRPP officials provide assistance to ensure that families and individuals receive a medical card.</p>  <p>  -  IRPP liaise with the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme.</p>  <p>  -  Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services, to provide information and to support and befriend the refugees.</p>  <p>  -  A GP is assigned to the relocated asylum seekers to ensure that their immediate medical needs are met including referral to dental and optical services. </p>  <p>  -  Childcare is  provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their EROC.</p>  <p>  -  Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  -  Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the EROCs.</p>  <p>  -  Once the asylum seekers receive refugee status and when housing is available, the refugees will be resettled in the community with the support of the IRPP and volunteers in the local community.  Each family will be assigned a resettlement worker to assist with the transition. </p>  <p>  In terms of settlement in the community, the overall model to be used will be identical to the model used for programme refugees as will be the suite of integration supports.  </p>  <p>  In relation to integration, the Deputy may also be aware that the Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for the Government's action to promote migrant integration for the period to 2020.  It sees integration as a two-way process which involves action by migrants and non-migrants alike.  It promotes action by Government, business, employers, migrants, NGOs and local communities.  The Strategy requires all Departments to insert integration as a theme in strategy statements, business plans and staff training.  It is using networks as a means of encouraging greater participation by migrants in all aspects of Irish life.  It includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.  It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund which I launched on 7 February, which will provide funding for community initiatives to promote integration.</p>  <p>  The IRPP integration model for relocated asylum seekers will work with existing best practice in this areas as pioneered by the OPMI but is also willing to work organically with community bodies, NGOs and civil society to see what else can be added to the integration model in order to help refugees successfully integrate into Irish society and rebuild their lives.  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming twelve months.</p></reply>

They were asked to make a contribution to the cost of implementing the Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex-Gratia Scheme.  Following reflection on the matter, all four congregations declined to make a financial contribution towards the implementation of the scheme.  </p><p>The matter was discussed again by the Government on 16 July 2013 and following that meeting the then Minister wrote to all four congregations expressing his disappointment that they had decided not to make a financial contribution, pointing out that the Government was of the view that the congregations had a moral obligation to do so and urging them to reconsider.  The congregations responded to that second request reaffirming their previous position. Further letters issued to the religious congregations in January 2014 and they again reaffirmed their position that they would not be making a financial contribution to the Scheme.  </p><p>All four religious congregations are cooperating fully with the scheme with regard to providing the appropriate records available to applicants.  My officials in the Restorative Justice Implementation Unit liaise with the religious congregations on a regular basis with regard to verifying records.To date awards totalling over &euro;25 million have been paid to 672 applicants under this Redress Scheme</p><p>In relation to the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme I am advised by the Minister for Education &amp;amp; Skills<font color="#00201F">, who has ministerial responsibility in this area, </font>that the <font color="#00201F">2002 Indemnity Agreement between the Government and religious congregations provided for a collective contribution of &euro;128 million from the 18 participating congregations in cash, counselling services and property with the cash element going towards the funding of the Redress Scheme.  The Minister for Education and Skills also advises that the combined value of all contributions received to date under the Agreement stands at &euro;117.8 million which represents 92% of the amount provided for in the Agreement.  The Minister understands that all cash and counselling provided for in the Agreement has been received and that a small number of property transfers remain to be completed. </font></p><p><font color="#00201F">For the sake of completeness, the Minister for Education and Skills points out that in response to the call for further substantial contributions towards the costs of residential institutional redress made in the aftermath of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Report), many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement made additional voluntary offers of cash and property.  The cash proceeds of these offers do not fund a redress scheme as such but I am advised by the Minister for Education and Skills that the cash proceeds are being made available to Caranua (the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund) and that to date some &euro;97 million in cash and associated interest has been contributed.</font></p></reply>

Full details on the two primary strands of the programme are set out below for the information of the Deputy.</p><p>Of the 1,191 people who have arrived thus far under the IRPP, a total of 536 persons are now living in the community in various locations nationwide.  It is expected that in the region of another 100 people will be housed within the community by the end of June 2017.  IRPP officials are working closely with local authorities across the State and the Irish Red Cross to secure appropriate accommodation for those currently in emergency accommodation and all future arrivals.  </p><p><b><i>Resettlement strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government announced last year that it was extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in 2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  215 of these have already arrived following a selection mission last October and a further mission to Beirut in late March/early April this year selected sufficient numbers to ensure the total of 1,040 is reached by the end of the 2017.</p><p><b><i>Relocation strand of the programme</i></b></p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to-date taken in a total of 459 people from Greece under relocation.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its initial commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme. </p><p>Ireland has agreed to take up to 20 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) under the IRPP.  Fundamentally, Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the child and family agency. 6 UAMs (by the Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme. However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort. Â All UAMs that have arrived to-date are in the care of Tusla.Â </p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.</p><p>  The total target for relocation EU-wide in the two Council Decisions for relocation also includes an unallocated portion which in the case of Ireland amounts to Â 910 persons.  These numbers have not yet been allocated as between Greece and Italy.Â Â It is understood that the European Commission are examining allocating this &quot;unassigned&quot; portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them.Â </p><p><b>Calais Minors</b></p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  21 UAMs have thus far arrived in Ireland under this initiative and are in the care of Tusla.<b></b>These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.<b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

Applications to establish and/or enforce court orders concerning access rights to children are also dealt with under the aforementioned international instruments.  The International Child Abduction Unit can only provide assistance when children have been taken to EU Member States or to countries that have are party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  Parents and guardians who have any concerns regarding the legality of parental separation should seek legal advice without delay.</p><p>  In 2015, a cross-Department/Agency group was established to discuss a number of issues relating to child abduction generally, including raising awareness in relation to child abduction.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the relevant authority to report child abductions to Interpol.  Parents are advised to seek legal advice in Ireland on their options.  They or their solicitor may also contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo;s Passport Office to request the children be added to the passport stop-list or request to be informed if the other parent applies for passports for the children.  In cases where the children may qualify for another state&rsquo;s passport, they may contact that state&rsquo;s Embassy and request that passports not be issued.  Parents may also apply to the Court requesting that it direct who should hold the passports, e.g. the concerned parent him- or herself, the Garda&iacute;, the courts etc. </p><p>  Parents concerned about cross-border child abduction by strangers should take all normal precautions such as familiarising themselves with the AMBER alert system, keeping medical and photographic records up to date and making online safety a priority.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, responsibility for effectiveness and responsiveness in child welfare and protection systems generally, in the context of the services that the Department provides, lies with my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

A more detailed analysis shows that this is a more acute problem in the Dublin area with over 36% of all occupants with some form of permission to stay and even more critical in self catering centres with over 44% of all residents in that category remaining the accommodation.  The figures in the Dublin area reflect the general issues with housing that are being experienced in the capital.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this fact, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which administers the system of accommodation for protection applicants, has always continued to provide such persons with continued accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation.

That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the recently published Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p><p>Following on from the McMahon report, my Department developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them.  The guide is available in all centres and has been published on the RIA website (<i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>) in a number of different languages.  This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), Citizens Information and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation.</p><p>Some families in centres who have sourced their own accommodation in the community may defer their move until breaks in the school year to minimise disruption to their children's education.  As the annual major school break approaches, it is anticipated that a number of families will move during that period. </p><p>Following a recent call for proposals under the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund, a number of charities and NGOs have been successful in applying for funding for projects with the specific aim of providing assistance to those transiting from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community.  While this work has only just begun I am confident that it will prove of great assistance and benefit to all concerned.  <table><tr><th>County</th><th>Centre</th><th>Address</th><th>Occupancy </th><th>Number with Status</th></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>Knockalisheen</td><td>Meelick</td><td><div>235</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>Ashbourne Hse</td><td>Glounthaune</td><td><div>90</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kinsale Road</td><td>Cork City</td><td><div>234</div></td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Glenvera</td><td>Wellington Road</td><td><div>98</div></td><td><div>7</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Millstreet</td><td>Millstreet</td><td><div>169</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Clonakilty Lodge</td><td>Clonakilty, Co.

Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  </p><p>With respect to legislation establishing hate crime as a specific and punishable crime, it is important that any legislation which is introduced will allow for effective prosecution of these type of offences.  </p><p>In the area of policing, the Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.  Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with GRIDO play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime.  GRIDO and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary. </p><p>With regard to the recording of crime incidents on PULSE, it should be noted that PULSE is a system which records crime data.  By contrast, I understand that the reports published by ENAR include not only reports of criminal acts, but also a range of other matters including incidents of verbal abuse and discrimination.  While these incidents may have a racist motivation they will not all amount to criminal offences.  Therefore the data published by ENAR and the crime data recorded on PULSE are not directly comparable. </p><p>The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office of my Department, is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy.  A new Migrant Integration Strategy was published on 7 February, 2017.  The Integration Strategy includes a number of actions to promote intercultural awareness and to combat racism and xenophobia.  It includes an action to review the current legislation on racially motivated crime with a view to strengthening the law on hate crime.  An open Call for Proposals was held under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund in September to November 2016.  Actions that combat racism are identified as a priority in Ireland's National Programme under the Fund.  Some of the projects selected are focusing on actions to combat racism.  A call for applications for national funding to promote integration has also been held.  Activities to combat racism and xenophobia will also be funded through this mechanism.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p><p>As outlined previously to the Deputy in parliamentary question number 43 of 2 March 2017, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. </p><p>I understand that work is continuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the 6 stations for inclusion in the pilot and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority.  In this context, I am sure that the Deputy would agree that a comprehensive and evidenced-based analysis should be carried out, taking account of all the relevant factors, before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner.

The position remains as stated. I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy is under consideration and has not yet reached a conclusion.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p><p>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established specifically for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

The assessment of the threat is that while an attack on Ireland is possible, it is not considered likely.  Nor is there at present any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international situation.</p><p>  The Deputy will understand, of course, that the detail of such security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  What I can say is that the Garda Authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.</p><p>There is a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern and they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda Authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. </p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.</p><p>A series of measures is currently being rolled at EU-level out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p><p>I should emphasise for the Deputy that the main security threat in the State is from republican paramilitary groups who reject the Good Friday Agreement and they continue to be a priority counter-terrorism focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda Authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in combatting these groups.

At that time, my Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.</p>  <p>  In England and Wales, for example, difficulties arising in connection with high trees or hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person concerned would have to show that an easement existed and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.</p>  <p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and overhanging trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland indicates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort.  This is intended to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings could leave a legacy of bitterness between adjoining property owners and ill-feeling in the local community.</p>  <p>  The Mediation Bill 2017, which is currently before the Oireachtas, does not deal directly with the issue of overhanging trees and high hedges.  It does, however, propose introduction of an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence legal proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness I should add that, under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, an owner or occupier of land is required to take all reasonable steps to ensure that trees, shrubs and hedges on land are not a hazard or potential hazard for a person using a public road.  The section also provides that where a tree, shrub or hedge is a hazard, or obstructs the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve notice on the owner or occupier of the land requiring that action such as the felling, cutting or removal of the tree, hedge or shrub be taken within a stated period.  In addition, section 58 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 provides that a network operator may, after serving notice on the owner or occupier of the land, lop or cut any tree or shrub which obstructs or interferes with any physical infrastructure of the network operator.</p></reply>

The scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the range of services expected in a modern courthouse is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and space constraints.  Accordingly, the Courts Service is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse including whether it should build a completely new courthouse on a new site or whether it is feasible to consider refurbishment and extension of the existing courthouse if an adjacent town centre site could be purchased.</p></reply>

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensure all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.</p>  <p>  At present, there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out management, administrative and technical roles.  The projected number of 4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium-term target of 20% civilians over the next five years.  That will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women are available for and utilised in operational areas.  This will be achieved through (i) a &lsquo;civilian by default&rsquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and (ii) redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties that may be done by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided funding for the recruitment of up to 500 civilians this year in line with the five-year reform and high level work force plan agreed by the Government in July 2016 to fill critical capacity and skills gaps in the organisation including in the areas of corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management.  Garda management have estimated that some 30% of the civilian appointments made this year will lead to redeployments of trained Garda&iacute; to the frontline.</p>  <p>  The three key civilian positions referred to by the Deputy are Executive Director Strategy and Transformation, Executive Director Legal and Compliance and Chief Information Officer.  These positions, which are at a level equivalent to Assistant Commissioner, will strengthen the capacity of senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and play an important role in the governance and modernisation of the organisation over the coming years.  I can inform the Deputy that a competition for the position of Executive Director Strategy and Transformation is currently in progress and is being run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  The closing date for applications was 20 April 2017.  I understand that PAS expects to hold final interviews before the end of this month.  I can further inform the Deputy that PAS expects to advertise the position of Executive Director Legal and Compliance within the next two weeks.  The job specification for the post of Chief Information Officer is the subject of discussion between Garda management and the Policing Authority which I hope will be concluded very shortly.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps in the years March 2014 to 2016 and, as of the 31 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table below.  In addition, there is a Chief Superintendent and a Superintendent attached to the DMR Traffic Corps, and a Superintendent attached to the West and South East Region.  The other three Regions each have a Traffic Inspector.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>This plan is progressing well.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 981 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Traffic Corps in the coming years.</p><p>The Commissioner has committed in her Policing Plan for 2017 to increase the number of personnel dedicated to traffic duties by 10% to support better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.</p><p>In this regard the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirement of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identify the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance with Road Traffic legislation.  Combined with this data I am informed that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event/Emergency Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of the vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the new recruits coming on stream.</p><p>Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) also sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Garda Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.<table><tr><th colspan="2">Garda Traffic Corps Strength</th></tr><tr><td>31 March 2014</td><td>795</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2015</td><td>733</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2016</td><td>691</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2017</td><td>655</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The House will understand the need for sensitivity in respect of those who have suffered greatly as a result of that incident.</p>  <p>  It is important that the truth of those allegations, insofar as they relate to any action or inaction on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should be established and there are ongoing processes, set out in law, to do just that.</p>  <p>  The concerns that had been raised with me were, in all cases, brought quickly to the attention of, and pursued with, the Garda Authorities in the context of the ongoing investigation and review processes into the events at Omeath and related matters.  I expect to receive a final report from the Garda Authorities addressing these matters when the investigation and review are completed.</p>  <p>  I was aware also that certain relevant matters had been brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  On 21 April 2017 the Ombudsman Commission indicated publicly that it had decided to initiate a public interest investigation into these matters in accordance with its statutory powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005-2015.  The Ombudsman Commission has indicated also that its public interest investigation will take place alongside the ongoing investigation of complaints made previously.  I understand that these investigations will encompass the issues that Deputies have raised in their Questions.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will agree it is essential that the Ombudsman Commission&rsquo;s investigations must be allowed to take their course in order that the truth or otherwise of allegations made can be established independently and in accordance with the law and, indeed, to identify anything that might be learned from those events.  In that context there are no plans to establish a further form of inquiry at this time.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate for me to go into the detail of allegations made, I would make the point that for obvious reasons of safety and security it has been the long-standing practice of my predecessors not to comment publicly on whether any person was or was not a Garda informant.  I do not propose to depart from that practice.</p>  <p>  The House will understand also that it is a fundamental aspect of our criminal justice system that decisions in relation to preferring charges in individual cases are solely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who acts independently in doing so.  The Office of the DPP is uniquely well-placed, with the relevant expertise, to make a determination as to what convictions are likely to be secured on the basis of the assessment of the evidence presented and in the light of all relevant legal provisions.</p></reply>

The key argument for recognition of Traveller ethnicity was that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely and symbolically important to Traveller pride and self-esteem and overcoming the legacy of economic marginalisation, discrimination and low self-esteem with which the Traveller community struggles.  This is not to ignore the real problems that Travellers face but this symbolic gesture will create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and the Government in together seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and an honest dialogue on these issues and challenges.  The historic statement by the Taoiseach is also a new beginning and the start of the work that we need to do as a society, in partnership with Travellers, to address the real and stark issues that face the Traveller community in areas such as health, employment, education and accommodation.  I will present my plans to address these issues in the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy which I will, in consultation with other Departments and Traveller and Roma representatives, finalise shortly.  I look forward to continuing to work with Travellers as part of what will be a broad-ranging Inclusion Strategy with an ambitious set of objectives.  The focus is on enhanced coordination and more effective use of existing resources.  Insofar as additional resources may be necessary for implementation of this Inclusion Strategy, this is a matter for the relevant Departments as part of the annual Estimates process.  I was successful in securing an additional &euro;1 million for my own Department's work in this regard for 2017 and I will seek further resources as the need arises in future years.</p></reply>

The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from Tusla who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection.</p><p>RIA's Child Protection and Welfare Policy and Practice Document is based on the HSE's Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  In relation to training of staff in centres, the HSE/Tusla has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training and Designate Liaison Person Training [DLP] to each centre's Designated Liaison Persons and other staff members.  RIA has recently updated its Child Protection Policy to include a Practice Document.  To communicate this policy, briefing sessions were held in every centre around the country for centre staff members and all other<font color="#FF0000"> </font>relevant personnel.

It should be noted that complaints in relation to the protection process itself (which is a legal process) are not within the remit of either Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) made arrangements for representatives from the Offices of both Ombudsmen to make presentations on the work of those Offices to accommodation centre staff and State service providers during the Autumn series of regional Inter-Agency meetings.  Representatives from the Offices of the Ombudsmen were also (and continue to be) facilitated in holding pre-publicised information sessions with residents in centres.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Direct Provision policy itself is structured through mainstream State services.  That is, health services are provided directly by HSE; education is provided directly through local schools; community welfare supports are provided through the Community Welfare Services; and child welfare and associated supports are provided by local Tusla teams.  Residents of RIA accommodation centres engage with these services in the same way as Irish citizens and therefore have the same rights to appeal decisions or make complaints through the relevant Departmental channels and through the relevant Ombudsmen where appropriate and necessary.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.386.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200069#WRH00700"><p>The Council of Europe Guidelines on Child Friendly Justice cover a range of issues under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p>For example, there are numerous references in the guidelines to the need to have regard to the best interests of the child and to hear the child's views during proceedings.  The fundamental principles outlined in the guidelines particularly in relation to determination of the best interests of the child are to a significant extent incorporated in the Children and Family Relationships Act.</p><p>The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children in family law proceedings which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by section 45 of the 2015 Act, provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with the new Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the 2015 Act.  Part V, entitled &ldquo;<i>Best Interests of the Child</i>&rdquo;, contains two important sections.</p><p><i>-  Section 31</i>sets out an extensive list of factors and circumstances to be taken into account by a court when determining the best interests of a child.  These include the views of the child that are ascertainable (whether in accordance with section 32 or otherwise).  The court can ascertain the views of the child in person or through an expert.  Section 31(6) provides that in obtaining the ascertainable views of a child, the court shall facilitate the free expression by the child of those views and endeavour to ensure that any views expressed by the child are not expressed as a result of undue influence, and may make an order under section 32.</p><p><i>-  Section 32</i>of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 facilitates the hearing of the voice of the child by enabling the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children and also give the courts the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.</p><p>In addition to the Children and Family Relationships Bill, the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 was published on 3 February 2017.  Section 23 of the Bill provides that children will have the opportunity to make their views known to the court where an order is sought on behalf of a child or relates in part to a child.  The court will also have the option of appointing an expert to assist the court to ascertain the views of the child.</p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 38</i>- &ldquo;<i>Children should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient conditions as adults.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>In Ireland, children cannot normally be a party to civil proceedings in their own name.  They must sue by their &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; and defend by their &ldquo;guardian ad litem&rdquo;.  In both cases this is a parent or other adult who consents to act in such capacity.  Regulation 5(6)(a) of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016 provides that where rules of court require that a person (such as a child) sues by their next friend or defend by their guardian ad litem, then the application for civil legal aid must be made by that person on behalf of the child.  Regulation 5(6)(b) requires that where a person is granted a legal aid certificate on behalf of another person, then the person applying for the certificate must sign an undertaking to pay to the Board any payment which a person granted legal aid in their own right would have to make.  However, Regulation 5(6)(e) provides that the Board can waive the requirements of Regulations 5(6)(a)-(d) where it thinks it appropriate to do so.</p><p>The Legal Aid Board can and does provide services to children in their own right in circumstances where it is appropriate to do so (for example, to an unaccompanied child seeking international protection in the State).  While civil legal aid in Ireland is not free, the Board would consider an application for a waiver of the contribution from a child who is being provided services in their own right.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is currently working on legislation to reform current Guardian ad litem arrangements.  Further information regarding these reform proposals can be provided by Minister Zappone.</p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 39</i>- &ldquo;<i>Lawyers representing children should be trained in and knowledgeable on children&rsquo;s rights and related issues, receive ongoing and indepth training and be capable of communicating with children at their level of understanding.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Over 80% of the work the Legal Aid Board does is in the field of family law.  In that respect, Legal Aid Board solicitors are knowledgeable in the field of family law including child care law.  The Board provides continuing professional development for its solicitors including an annual conference which normally is on a family or child care law issue.</p><p>In relation to <i>Guideline 43</i>- &ldquo;<i>Adequate representation and the right to be represented independently from the parents should be guaranteed, especially in proceedings where the parents, members of the family or caregivers are the alleged offenders.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>In respect of child care proceedings, the Legal Aid Board normally provides representation to parents who are Respondents to such proceedings.  It is not normal for a child to be a party to such proceedings.  However, in circumstances where this is the case they will be separately represented and in such cases representation will be paid for by the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) rather than the Board.</p><p>Insofar as the guidelines are concerned with respecting and protecting the rights of children coming into contact with the criminal justice system and its adaptation to the specific needs and treatment of children while in that system, specific legal provision for these children is made in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  The Act establishes a separate legal framework for dealing with young offenders incorporating principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over children by the courts.  These include, inter alia, the principles that children have rights and freedom before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults, in particular, a right to be heard and to participate in any proceedings of the court that can affect them; that any penalty imposed on a child for an offence should cause as little interference as possible with the child's legitimate activities and pursuits; that any penalty should take the form most likely to maintain and promote the development of the child and should take the least restrictive form that is appropriate in the circumstances; and that a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort.</p><p>I am delighted to say that on 6 April 2017, I signed three legal instruments under the Prisons Act, 2015.  The effect of these three Orders was to close down St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and subsume the only remaining wing of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s building &ndash; &lsquo;B&rsquo; wing - into Mountjoy Prison, all with effect from 7 April 2017.  The signing of these orders follows the making of orders by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Minister Katherine Zappone, T.D., which allows for the committal of newly sentenced 17 year old children directly to Oberstown Children Detention Campus with effect from 31 March, 2017.  Previously, responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention facilities at Oberstown in May 2012 and responsibility for all 17-year-old male remands was transferred in March 2015.  The overall effect of these recent legal instruments by both Ministers is that (i) from 31 March, 2017 no further new committals of children could be made by the Courts to the adult prison system and (ii) that on 7 April, 2017, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution was fully closed down, subsumed into Mountjoy Prison and no longer has a legal existence of its own.</p><p>Ending the practice of sending children to the adult prison system was a long standing Government commitment and was a key commitment in the programme for Government 2011-2016.  St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution has been the subject of much criticism by various bodies and persons involved in the area of human rights and children&rsquo;s rights.  The signing of these orders has consigned the name of St Patrick's Institution to the history books and is a significant and progressive step forward in the treatment of children in Ireland.</p><p>In addition, under the framework of the Inter-governmental Agreement on Cooperation in Criminal Justice Matters, the Youth Justice Services in Ireland and Northern Ireland meet on a regular basis to exchange information on experiences and best practice on a range of youth justice issues.  Such activity is encouraged by Part V of the CoE Guidelines.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) also makes provision for children to make complaints in their own right without the requirement for the consent of a parent.  I am informed that in this way children can access the police complaints system independently.  Thereafter GSOC&rsquo;s interaction with children is governed by its Child Welfare and Protection Policy.  GSOC have trained specialist interviewers who are deployed as appropriate to take statements from and conduct investigations into complaints made by children.  GSOC works closely with its partner agencies i.e. Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and TUSLA to ensure children receive a co-ordinated response with an emphasis on providing services which are in the best interests of the child.  In conducting its investigations into complaints made by or on behalf of children GSOC takes cognisance of the European Directive on Victims of Crime and conducts assessments with regard to vulnerability and any specific protection needs.  As part of its remit as an oversight body GSOC has also made recommendations to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to how juveniles are treated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This Directive establishes minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime across the European Union.  Child victims of crime are to be considered and treated as full bearers of the rights set out in the Directive and implementation of the measures - which include particular protection measures for children during criminal proceedings - will enhance the level of supports being provided to such victims.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 which was published on 29 December, 2016 and is due to be progressed through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il shortly will transpose into Irish law the EU Victims Directive.  The introduction of this legislation also fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government to enact legislation to strengthen the rights of victims of crime and their families.  In tandem with this, and pending the enactment of the legislation, all of the criminal justice agencies have been working to ensure that the measures contained in the EU Victims Directive have been put in place on an administrative basis since it came into effect in November 2015.</p>  <p>  Finally I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to ensuring that the Victims Bill provides that highest level of protection possible for all victims of crime, and particularly those who have the greatest need for protection such as child victims.  In this regard child victims benefit from all of the rights provided under the Bill and specific provision is being made for a range of additional rights which will strengthen the supports available to child victims of crime.</p>  <p>  I will keep the question of the establishment of the children's house model under review.</p></reply>

Minister Ross commenced Section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 2016 on 13 April 2017.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Section 33 of the Act of 2016 amends section 22 of the 2002 Road Traffic Act to ensure that drivers convicted in court produce their driving licence in order that penalty points can be recorded on the driver file.  The Act of 2016 provides for a new requirement for the presiding judge to ask a driver convicted in court for a driving offence to produce his/her licence to the court.  The court will then record the licence details, or the fact that it was not produced, with failure to produce a licence an offence.  This provision will tighten up existing procedures to enable penalty points to be matched to driving licence records following conviction in court.</p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I are in ongoing contact in relation to road safety and road traffic enforcement matters and our officials meet regularly, via a number of different groups and fora, including the Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, which both Minister Ross and I attended at its most recent meeting on 27th March.</p></reply>

The project will facilitate the application of penalty points to driving licences, thereby improving the effectiveness of road traffic enforcement measures.  I can inform the Deputy that work is underway in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to progress this project.  To enable the Master Licence Record, multiple system and process changes will need to be implemented across a number of organisations, including the Courts Service, which will take some time to design and develop.</p>  <p>  The Master Licence Record project stems from recommendations contained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s report &lsquo;The Fixed Charge Processing System &ndash; A 21st   Century Strategy&rsquo; (February 2014).  The Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS)) Working Group is responsible for monitoring and overseeing progress on all FCPS recommendations, including progress on the Master Licence Record project.  This Working Group is a multi-agency group, comprising representatives from the following Government Departments and public bodies: Departments of Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Courts Service; Road Safety Authority; Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; the Revenue Commissioners; the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; and the Office of the Attorney General.  The Working Group met most recently on 26 April 2017 and the provision of a progress report on the Master Licence Record project is a standing agenda item at the Group's meetings.</p>  <p>  A progress report was recently submitted to me from the Working Group on 2016 activity.  22 of the 37 Inspectorate recommendations have been fully implemented to date, with 5 additional recommendations on track for delivery by Summer 2017.  Work on the remaining recommendations is ongoing and the majority of these recommendations are medium-long-term in nature, including the implementation of the Master Licence Record project.</p></reply>

I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initially put in place new paper based recording and verification processes, and, in November 2016, a new specific data recording IT upgrade was installed on the Garda PULSE system.  The net effect of the new IT upgrade was that personnel now have to record the serial number of the device used for each breath test plus the meter reading before and after the checkpoint was concluded.  Data from the device is now used to verify the total number of breath tests conducted at each checkpoint.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in addition to outlining the issues, how they had come to light, and the remedial steps taken so far the Commissioner has:</p>  <p>  - announced the restructuring of traffic policing with the creation of a new Roads Policing Unit to be led by Assistant Commissioner Mick Finn;</p>  <p>  - announced the creation of a dedicated team under newly-appointed Assistant Commissioner Michael O&rsquo;Sullivan to investigate in detail the MATs issue, including with a view to identifying and holding responsible for their actions any Garda members, whether at junior, supervisory or management level, who acted improperly; and</p>  <p>  - committed to forwarding the report of this investigation to the Policing Authority and Department of Justice and Equality when completed.</p>  <p>  Assistant Commissioner Finn has outlined new arrangements agreed with the Medical Bureau on Roads Safety (MBRS) to the effect that body would supply An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with its data on breath-testing devices on a quarterly basis, in order to ensure an independent benchmark against which Garda data can be measured.  The MBRS will shortly be tendering for new breath testing equipment.  New equipment which is available in the market place has the capacity to record the time, GPS location and number of persons breath-tested, and has the capacity to download the information automatically, reducing the chances of errors occurring in the data.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have written to the Chairperson of the Policing Authority in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 (as amended) to report to me on its oversight of the issues which have arisen in relation to mandatory alcohol testing over the coming period.  In particular, I requested that an investigation should be conducted to examine all issues arising, addressing to the extent possible the reasons why the issues have arisen; the incidence and scale of the issues; and the solutions implemented to ensure there is no recurrence.  It is expected that the Authority will engage outside expertise to carry out this work.  The Deputy will appreciate that I need to await the conclusion of the Authority's work in this area before I am in a position to comment further on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that there is ongoing engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in relation to this matter, including in the context of the Authority's recent public meeting with the Garda Commissioner, the focus of which was roads policing, including the issues associated with Fixed Charge Notices and breath test data.</p></reply>

I am also advised that the Expert Group on Crime Statistics, chaired by the CSO, has prepared a report which considers a number of issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate and this is due to be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In relation to domestic violence, Cosc &ndash; the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Courts Service; and the Probation Service are all currently working on a State Data Committee with the Central Statistics Office and Tusla under the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based violence 2016 &ndash; 2021 in order to improve data availability and disaggregation in the area.  Specifically, the Second National Strategy provides for the establishment of a gold standard with regard to the collection and analysis of data under a range of categories.  Similarly, the recently established Data Working Group, chaired by Cosc, with representative members from non-government organisations including Women&rsquo;s Aid, SAFE Ireland and Sonas Domestic Violence Charity Ltd. are currently devising a work plan to advise on the enhancement of data in the area.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the recording of incidents relating to domestic abuse is closely monitored by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau to ensure</p>  <p>  -  a uniform approach is maintained in the recording and investigation of such incidents;</p>  <p>  -  that records accurately reflect such violence/abuse; and</p>  <p>  -  that victims receive appropriate supports from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in the monitoring, managing and investigation of such incidents and from other state and  non-governmental organisations within the community.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that work is ongoing to ensure that proper quality assurance processes are put in place, with a view to publishing relevant statistical information in due course, and after appropriate consultations with the CSO.</p>  <p>  Work to address the full range of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations, including in relation to data quality, is ongoing and is supported by very large investments totalling &euro;330 million from 2016-2021 for Garda technology and systems, including &euro;250 million under the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  While it is not intended to convene an interdepartmental group at this time, I can assure the Deputy that significant work is underway to improve the collection of data relating to the recording of domestic violence.  While progress has been made, further incremental improvements will occur over time, resulting in the delivery of far more robust data to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in analysing and improving their service to victims of domestic violence.</p></reply>

In determining whether to make a deportation order, in addition to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, I must also consider all relevant constitutional and international human rights arising, including those enshrined in the Refugee Convention, the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Charter of Human Rights.  The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement</i>as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.  This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture <font color="#212100">or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</font></p><p>A deportation order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.  The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to deportation orders.  Where persons have been identified as a threat to national security by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it remains open to me to make deportation orders against such persons and I have done so in the past and will continue to do so where appropriate.</p><p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that the numbers of Deportation Orders signed, effected and revoked in 2016 and 2017 are as set out in the following tables:</p><p>Deportation orders signed 2016 broken down by Asylum and Non Asylum<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>937</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1196</td></tr></table></p><p>Deportation orders signed 2017 broken down by Asylum and Non Asylum<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>96</td></tr></table></p><p>Deportation Orders Effected 2016<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>367</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>428</td></tr></table></p><p>Deportation Orders Effected 2017<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td></tr></table></p><p>Breakdown of Deportation Orders Revocations Section 3(11) 2016<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>348</td></tr></table></p><p>Breakdown of Deportation Orders Revocations Section 3(11) 2017<table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Non Asylum</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Asylum</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>39</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Central Bank takes these obligations very seriously and complies with them on an on-going basis as appropriate.  The Central Bank has indicated that, as its investigations proceed, it will keep matters under constant review and that, guided by the evidence, it will make reports to other statutory bodies as necessary.</p></reply>

This would be very difficult to administer and could lead to accidental or fraudulent underpayments of VAT.</p>  <p>  The ESRI reported in 2016 that any tax incentives aimed at developers are likely to have little effect on supply while other constraints are in place, such as stringent planning regulations, infrastructural constraints, and access to finance and building costs, including the impact of building regulations.</p>  <p>  In the presence of such constraints, the introduction of any tax incentive would likely lead to a transfer of tax revenue away from the State without any significant effect on supply. </p></reply>

It is key that the EBA can continue its critical work with minimal disruption following the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Government made a public declaration of interest in hosting the European Banking Authority in October of last year.  We strongly believe that relocation to Dublin is the best option for the important work of the EBA and the least disruptive location for EBA staff.</p>  <p>  The public declaration was the first stage in letting the wider financial community know that Ireland wants to be considered as a host in the relocation process.  Ireland has a significant financial services sector, efficient transport links to other European capitals and the capacity to absorb the European Banking Authority&rsquo;s relocation to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Also our interest in hosting the European Banking Authority demonstrates the continued importance Ireland places in well regulated Financial Services and it has sent a signal to the global financial sector of the importance that Ireland places on the financial services sector.    </p>  <p>  The Department's role in promoting Ireland as a location of choice for the EBA is outlined in the current IFS 2020 strategy and since the declaration, Minister of State Murphy along with my officials are  promoting Ireland as a location of choice for the European Banking Authority. </p>  <p>  My officials have been engaging with relevant stakeholders in order to further progress the goal of relocating the European Banking Authority to Ireland.  These engagements included meetings with the European Banking Authority and the European Commission in order to highlight the benefits of relocating the Authority to Ireland.  The meetings have also sought to determine the needs of the European Banking Authority and its staff when they are moved from London.  Minister of State Murphy also met with the Executive Director of the European Banking Authority earlier this year.</p>  <p>  The ultimate decision on relocation of the European Banking Authority will be made by both the European Council and Parliament.  However, I would point out that the European Commission is currently carrying out a review of the European Supervisory Authorities (of which the EBA is one).  Included in this consultation is the option of merging the EBA with another authority based in Frankfurt.  In addition, at the recent European Council it was stated that a procedure for deciding the location for the EBA and the European Medicines Board will be agreed in June, with the potential for a decision on their new locations in Autumn.      </p></reply>

It should be noted that this is not reflective of any valuation that might be achieved by the State as part of an IPO as it is an indicative &lsquo;outside-in&rsquo; valuation based on the estimated financial position of the bank at year end 2016 and publicly available information.</p>  <p>  The most recent official forecast of general government debt (GGD) for 2017, published in the Stability Programme Update in April 2017, was &euro;204.6 billion, which equated to 72.9% of GDP.  The impact of a 100% sale at the ISIF valuation would reduce the debt to GDP ratio by 4.0 percentage points to 68.9%.  The impact of a 25% sale at the ISIF valuation would reduce the debt to GDP ratio by 1.0 percentage points to 71.9%.</p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, it is my view that because public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the banks, it is appropriate to use one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets to reduce debt.  A lower level of debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also result in reduced interest payments in future years.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Directive, defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  </p>  <p>  In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within particular categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower VAT rate or an exemption from VAT.  The supply of a defibrillator is not included in any of those categories of goods and therefore there is no discretion for Ireland to remove VAT from that supply.</p>  <p>  The VAT (Refund of Tax) (No.15) Order, 1981 provides that individuals can obtain repayment of VAT expended on certain goods and appliances which assist persons with a disability to overcome that disability.  In this context, a defibrillator purchased by or on behalf of an individual may qualify for a VAT refund.  However, a defibrillator purchased for general use by a charity or voluntary body would not qualify for a refund under this Order. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government recognises the difficulties faced by community groups in relation to VAT rates on certain products, such as defibrillators.  While this is an EU competency, the Government has committed to work with our EU counterparts in seeking to reform this area. </p>  <p>  Finally, in question 19241/17 the deputy appears to be referring to possible voted expenditure initiatives to support the goals referred to in this question, such expenditure would not fall within the ambit of my department's vote.</p></reply>

As announced in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement, it is proposed to retain some of the unused fiscal space in 2019, following the achievement of the medium-term budgetary objective in 2018, as a contingency reserve.  If it is not deployed in the event of unanticipated adverse shock to the economy, it will be remitted to the rainy day fund.  Work is underway on a consultation document to be circulated to the Oireachtas on the proposed operation of the fund and the specific circumstances under which it could be deployed.</p>  <p>  Hypothecation involves linking specific expenditure to an explicit revenue source.  It is only used in limited circumstances where there is a strong justification because it can cause difficulties for the efficient and effective management of the public finances.  Furthermore, it also exposes specific expenditure dependent solely on a hypothecated revenue to any volatility associated with the revenue source in question.    </p>  <p>  As regards smoothing annual revenues, I assume that the Deputy is suggesting that revenue deemed to be in excess of a set level is paid from the Exchequer into a designated fund and subsequently drawn down from the fund when the revenue falls below the set level in order to maintain expenditure levels.  </p>  <p>  The basic premise behind the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that cyclical or windfall revenue should not be spent, is one that the Government agrees with as evidenced by its commitment to comply with the fiscal rules.  Under the rules, future permitted expenditure levels are driven by existing expenditure levels and the trend growth rate of the economy.  To increase expenditure above the permitted level, discretionary revenue measures, usually tax increases, must be introduced.  This is designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure are sustainably financed and it will reduce the danger that additional expenditure is being funded on the back of cyclical or windfall revenues.</p>  <p>  The second part of the equation is that cyclical or windfall revenues from corporation tax, or, potentially, other taxes, should be held in a vehicle to be used to fund general expenditure, if and when revenues drop.  </p>  <p>  Consideration of this would need to reach a view on the appropriateness of holding such money in a vehicle or fund when our general government debt is very high in nominal terms, at over &euro;200 billion.  While such a fund would reduce our net debt, it would keep our gross debt at a high level and there would be, in all likelihood, a carry cost to bear.  Furthermore, reducing our gross debt will increase our fiscal headroom or borrowing capacity that could be needed in the event of a future crisis and the reduction in gross debt would also reduce our annual interest bill.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that money transferred to such a fund from the Exchequer would not qualify as expenditure in statistical terms.  It would only be when the money is transferred back to the Exchequer and spent that it would impact the general government balance.  Unfortunately, the statistical system does not reward funding expenditure by savings put aside in previous years.</p>  <p>  The key difference between the rainy day fund and the type of vehicle referred to in the question is that the rainy day fund could only be used to fund expenditure in certain specified circumstances and not as a general funding source.</p></reply>

The proposal was included in my Department's Tax Strategy Group papers of 2015 which form a basis for the discussions of the Tax Strategy Group.  As discussed in that paper, a levy of this type, on presumably the profits of tobacco companies, is not without complications and may have impacts on other areas of the economy.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, profits of companies are taxed through corporation tax.  To levy the profits of tobacco companies would complicate this. Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% on trading income is akin to a brand and is an important part of the Government's strategy of creating an enterprise friendly environment to attract jobs and investment to Ireland. One of the main features of the rate is its simplicity and the fact that it applies to a broad base.  The suggested levy would involve complexity and could undermine the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax offering.</p>  <p>  When a tobacco industry levy was proposed in the UK in 2015, the British Treasury concluded, on foot of a public consultation, that the impact of a tobacco industry levy would be passed on to the consumer.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Summer Budget 2015 that he would not be pursuing the proposal.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government, this Government is committed to making Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  The Government has agreed that pricing is a key means of reducing tobacco consumption.  I have increased the price on a packet of cigarettes cumulatively by &euro;1.40 over my last three budgets, raising revenue and contributing to the continued decline of smoking prevalence.  Ireland continues to impose excise duty on tobacco which is among the highest in the EU.</p></reply>

This payment is particularly significant given that it has been nine years since the bank last paid a dividend to shareholders. </p>  <p>  While the factors influencing such dividend payments are outside my control, I would consider it normal for a profitable bank in a normal business environment to pay a prudent, regular dividend to Ordinary Shareholders where there is no impediment to do so, in keeping with a commercial strategy and financial performance objectives espoused by the bank&rsquo;s management.</p>  <p>  In determining that an IPO was the best route to maximise value for the State the Department and its advisors ran a number of income and capital return scenarios over the period since 2014.  To date however we have not formally incorporated any forecast dividend payment schedule in our budgetary projections.  Given the State is considering a disposal of some of its shares over the coming period, it would not be advisable for me to put any forecasts into the public domain.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, while I am aware of the difficulties faced by the hotel sector, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide cover or to price at a particular level.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  Accordingly, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  This Working Group is examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short, medium and long-term measures can be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.</p><p>The Working Group is now in its second phase which is concentrating on the Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance sectors.  The terms of reference for this work have been agreed and the following core areas are being considered:</p><p>- Overview of the Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance sectors </p><p>- Impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors </p><p>- Impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance </p><p>- Other market issues</p><p>In addition, the Working Group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas particularly in relation to: </p><p>- Personal Injury data and information </p><p>- Effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs </p><p>- Current claims compensation arrangements and cost of claims </p><p>- Impact of unlawful activity on insurance sector</p><p>The Working Group is continuing to meet on a regular basis to examine issues related to Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance, including those pertinent to the hotel sector.  Indeed, as part of the current consultation process, there has already been a very informative engagement with the Irish Hotels Federation, as well as other organisations within the hospitality sector such as the Licensed Vintners Association and the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland. </p><p>It is envisaged that the final results of the second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing Report.  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Order also extend to works carried out on homes to adapt them to make them more accessible for disabled persons.

With effect from 1 January 2015, any unused accelerated capital allowances, which are carried forward beyond the &ldquo;tax life&rdquo; of the building or structure to which they relate, are lost immediately </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that a Revenue eBrief was issued on 1 September 2015 to draw the attention of taxpayers and their agents to the implications of this measure.  It outlined the changes introduced and provided a timely reminder to anyone filing tax returns that the capital allowances computations carried forward to 2015 should be adjusted to exclude any building or structure whose &ldquo;tax life&rdquo; ended in 2014.  Revenue issued a further eBrief in the matter in April 2016.  Revenue has included a reminder note on Income Tax and Corporation Tax Return forms since 2015, in the relevant section where capital allowances claims are made by taxpayers, that the carry forward of excess accelerated capital allowances by passive investors is no longer available in accordance with Chapter 4A of Part 12 TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the bulk of tax returns to potentially reflect the effects of the restriction contained in Chapter 4A were only received in late 2016.

My Department has received a number of such proposals from both the Irish League of Credit Unions  (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA).  Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.  While the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, any such proposal would require approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank before it could be implemented.</p><p><b>Social Housing Funding</b></p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that it has received information regarding proposals for credit unions to provide funding for social housing and is currently engaging with the sector on those proposals.  It further stated that while it does not comment on specific proposals, such investments could be facilitated by future regulations made by the Central Bank, where appropriate.  The Central Bank also stated that it is willing to consider the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.  However, the Central Bank's key consideration in evaluating such proposals is its statutory mandate to ensure the protection of members' savings by credit unions and to ensure the wellbeing of the sector generally.</p><p>Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with the representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments have also met with the Central Bank.  Separately, communication is ongoing between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and my Department.</p><p>On 1 January 2016, I commenced the final sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) following discussions with credit union representative bodies.  Following commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, regarding a number of areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity.</p><p>Investment regulations made specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank are currently reviewing the investment regulations for credit unions and on completion of their review will undertake a public consultation in 2017.  </p><p>Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.</p><p><b>SME Lending</b></p><p>In relation to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the  Central Bank has informed me that credit unions are permitted to provide commercial loans to their members.  Commercial loans are subject to concentration, maturity and large exposure limits as outlined in the 2016 Regulations.  In addition, where a credit union is considering granting a commercial loan, a comprehensive business plan and detailed financial projections (supported by evidence based assumptions), appropriate for the scale and complexity of the loan, should be provided and in place before such a loan is granted.  This should enable the credit union to ensure that it is satisfied that the borrowing business has the capacity to generate sufficient income to repay the commercial loan.  The Central Bank has further informed me that lending to SMEs is a specialist form of lending that requires specific skills and expertise. In general, this type of lending is viewed as high risk which may not be appropriate for all credit unions. </p><p><b>Mortgages</b></p><p>Currently credit unions can and some do provide mortgages to members.  These types of loans are subject to certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member. Under the 2016 Regulations credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are currently 12 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.</p><p>The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and in some cases 15%).  </p><p>The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, being part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure &ndash; the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case. </p><p>The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report makes a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits and concentration limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which to date has met on three occasions  and  is currently assessing each of CUAC's recommendations with a view to implementation as appropriate.  Central to its work is ensuring a full examination of lending limits and concentration limits is carried out as recommended.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.</p></reply>

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date.  Revenue takes the view that land on which solar panels are installed is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test.  Thus, depending on the amount of an individual's land that is actually occupied by solar panels (and not merely subject to an option over the land), the use of agricultural land for a solar farm may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief. </p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least 6 years after taking the gift or inheritance.  It is unlikely that the ability to farm the land would be affected by the granting of an option over the land to a solar farm developer or the registration of a burden over the land with the Land Registry.  However, the ability to farm the land would be affected where the option is exercised by the solar farm developer and solar panels are actually installed.  As it would not generally be possible to farm any part of the land occupied by solar panels, the change in the use of land from farming to the generation of solar energy within the required 6-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.</p>  <p>  I would however inform the Deputy that arising out of a commitment I made in the D&aacute;il during the Report Stage of Finance Act 2016, an interdepartmental group has been established, which is currently examining the treatment for tax purposes of farmland on which solar panels are installed. </p>  <p>  I expect that group to report to me in due course with its recommendations. </p></reply>

This also introduced new obligations on certain categories of persons in regulated firms to disclose breaches of financial services legislation to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has established a whistleblower desk and put in place policies and procedures to ensure that such disclosures are dealt with appropriately.</p>  <p>  In broad terms, where a person makes a disclosure in good faith to the Central Bank or one of its employees, and the person making the disclosure has reasonable grounds for believing that the disclosure will show that there has been a breach of, or offence under, financial services legislation or the concealment or destruction of evidence relating to such an offence or breach and provides their name, the disclosure is a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The EU Regulation establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which formally commenced on 4 November 2014, includes a provision in respect of reporting of breaches, i.e. whistleblower reports, which relate to those banks directly supervised by the European Central Bank.  Persons with information on potential breaches of EU law by banks and/or by competent authorities, including the Central Bank of Ireland, can report such breaches to the ECB.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that whistleblower procedures for banks and other financial institutions are robust and that they give adequate protection to whistleblowers.  All allegations from whistleblowers are treated seriously and examined thoroughly irrespective of which legislative protections apply. It is a valuable channel for the Central Bank to receive reports in a confidential form.  </p>  <p>  Any individual who has new information regarding a previous allegation is welcome to contact the Bank again with this new information.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is currently considering approximately 50 whistleblower allegations.</p></reply>

These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive.  Firstly, the date of a gift or, in the case of an inheritance, the date of the death of a disponer, is the date by reference to which the CAT Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Secondly, the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo;, i.e. the date on which the market value of the assets/property comprising the gift or inheritance is established, is generally the date of the gift or, in the case of an inheritance, is generally the date on which probate or administration is granted.  This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any gift or inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 January to 31 August, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in that year.  Where the valuation date for a gift or an inheritance is in the period 1 September and 31 December, a CAT return and payment of CAT due must be made by 31 October in the following year.</p>  <p>  Where a CAT liability is attributable to a gift or an inheritance of &lsquo;real&rsquo; property such as land and/or buildings, a beneficiary has a statutory entitlement to pay this liability by monthly instalments over a period of up to five years.  Instalments are subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8% on the amount of the outstanding tax.  However, Revenue has the discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period of time in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship.  In cases of hardship, Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. </p>  <p>  Revenue may also exercise discretion in relation to any property or assets by allowing the payment of CAT over a longer instalment period than the statutory five-year period allowed for &lsquo;real&rsquo; property.

The term &ldquo;family member&rdquo; is not defined in the legislation governing the scheme and, consequently, the CAT legislation is used as a guideline.  However, an application by a &ldquo;family member&rdquo; not covered under the CAT legislation, who is living with the person with a disability and who has sole responsibility for the care and transportation of that person, may still qualify for relief.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the application from the person (details supplied) in respect of the transportation of a disabled passenger (her father-in-law) has been reviewed.  As it has been confirmed that the applicant is living with her father-in-law in this case and is solely responsible for his care and transportation, it has been decided to allow the tax relief.

The IRP was established to hear appeals from impacted customers who had lost ownership of the relevant property or who are now/were previously engaged in legal action with the Group over their mortgage.  The CAP was established to hear appeals from all other impacted customers.  </p><p>&quot;The members of the panels include senior independent representatives from the legal and accountancy professions.  Members were proposed by Permanent TSB and the Central Bank was informed of the identities of the individual members prior to their appointments.  The panels are serviced by a secretariat which is itself independent of the bank.</p><p>&quot;Customers bringing an appeal to either of these panels incur no charges for doing so from either Permanent TSB or from the panels themselves.  Customers may bring an appeal even after accepting any payments made by the Bank in respect of the issue with no impact on their appeal what-so-ever.  Customers who are unhappy with the outcome of the appeal are still entitled to pursue the matter to the Financial Service Ombudsman and/or the Courts.</p><p>&quot;These appeal panels offer a reasonable, fast and cost free method for impacted customers to appeal the redress proposals set out by the Bank.  Importantly the redress proposals may be appealed even though the customer has accepted the amounts offered.  Taking an appeal to these panels does not limit the customer&rsquo;s ability to appeal the matter further including to the Courts.</p><p>&quot;To date appeals have been submitted to these panels in respect of just 20% of eligible cases (i.e. in respect of 273 accounts of the total population of 1,372 accounts).  It should be noted that despite the Bank giving a full 12 months for customers to decide whether to appeal to these panels or not, 59 appeals (including 50 from one individual financial advisor) were submitted after the 12 month deadline had expired.  Nevertheless, the panel in question reviewed the merits of each appeal and decided in all cases to allow them to be processed despite being outside the permitted time limit.</p><p>&quot;The table details the outcome of appeals submitted.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.</p><p>I am advised that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  These terms can include the driving experience of the driver, as well as the type and age of car, the age, claims record and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market. In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  </p><p>However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation. </p><p>My attention has been drawn to the difficulties faced by drivers who have spent time abroad and subsequently lose recognition for previous driving experience.  In order to tackle this issue, the Report recommends that a standard protocol be put in place for insurance companies in order to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.  By the second quarter of this year, insurers are to implement policies to accept driver experience from abroad when a person has previous driving experience in Ireland and is coming from a country that drives on the left side of the road (e.g. UK), and take full account of the experience in that country and previous relevant Irish experience when pricing policy.  By the end of the year, this protocol is to be extended to take appropriate account of driving experience gained in countries which drive on the right hand side of the road.  My Department is working with Insurance Ireland to ensure that these actions are implemented by the deadlines set down in the Report.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>or 01-6761914.  </p></reply>

It is quite clear that there are major challenges ahead, for the EU, the UK and for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the border with Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit is very clear and has been articulated by the Taoiseach on several occasions and again by Government on the triggering of Article 50.  Continued freedom of movement, absence of a hard border, and minimal impact on business and trade are key objectives.  The Government is clear that any manifestation of a hard border would have very negative consequences.  A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border. Clearly in this regard the closer the trading relationship between the UK and EU is more generally the better. </p>  <p>  My Department has been preparing for the impact of Brexit since well before the referendum on 23 June 2016, with this work now intensified.  The primary areas for the Department of Finance relate to the economic and financial sector implications stemming from Brexit.  This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The acknowledgement of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, the need to protect the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement, and the need to avoid a hard border within the Article 50 negotiating guidelines approved at the European Council meeting on 29 April has been the result of a major Government campaign to ensure our specific concerns are fully recognised.  The precise arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK that will now take place following formal notification under Article 50.  It is not helpful to pre-empt any particular outcome at this early stage of the process.</p></reply>

As the issues arising from Brexit involve many areas of Revenue&rsquo;s work, the role of the dedicated Brexit Unit (currently 9 full-time equivalents) is to draw together the expertise from relevant specialist areas and provide advice for Government, while working closely with the Department of Finance and within the interdepartmental structures which have been established by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Support for the Brexit Unit also involves significant input from areas such as information technology, legislation, international relations, customs, tax and statistics.  The Board and Management Committee receive a monthly briefing, and are individually involved in strategic issues.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to give an accurate assessment of the full-time equivalent number of persons engaged at any time, but it is the case that the Brexit Unit is at the centre of a major organisation-wide effort to contribute to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the Brexit negotiations and to prepare Revenue to manage the implications arising.  The present full-time resource is sufficient for the exploration of possible Brexit scenarios.  As more certainty emerges about the likely timescale and arrangements for Brexit, related work will absorb an increasing amount of Revenue&rsquo;s resources, and new resources will be deployed as required. </p></reply>

As part of this mandate, in accordance with Article 127(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the ECB has the sole responsibility for the definition and implementation of monetary policy within the European Union. </p>  <p>  In the face of weak inflation dynamics across the Eurozone in recent years, the ECB has maintained an accommodative interest rate position of close to, and in some cases below, the zero bound on its three key interest rates.  In its most recent monetary policy decision of April 27th 2017, the ECB Governing Council (GC) maintained these key interest rates at the levels which have been in operation since March of 2016. </p>  <p>  Following the April 2017 meeting, the ECB GC also reaffirmed its expectation that its key interest rates will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of its Expanded Asset Purchase Programme (i.e. QE), which is scheduled to continue until the end of December 2017 at the earliest, or until a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with the stated aim of the ECB is observed.</p>  <p>  In the recently published Stability Programme Update for 2017, the Department of Finance provided estimates of the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in the main ECB interest rate (i.e. main refinancing operations) on a range of economic indicators over the period from 2017 to 2021.  Based on this analysis, such an increase would lead to Irish output being 1.3 per cent below the &ldquo;no interest rate change" baseline forecast by 2018 and unemployment being 0.3 percentage points higher than baseline over the same time horizon.</p></reply>

The EU Commission have purported that Ireland has not fulfilled its obligations under Article 56 (freedom to provide services) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union due to the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) treatment of vehicles that are brought into the State on a temporary basis.</p>  <p>  The Case was heard in the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the 22 November 2016.  The Court has not given its ruling yet. However, the Advocate General delivered his opinion on the Case on 2 March 2017.  In his opinion the Advocate General proposed that the Court should find that the action brought by the Commission was well founded.</p>  <p>  However, I must strongly emphasise that the Advocate General's Opinion is not binding on the Court of Justice.  It is the role of the Advocates General to propose to the Court, in complete independence, a legal solution to the cases for which they are responsible.  The Judges of the Court now begin their deliberations in this case and judgment will be given at a later date- normally in 2 to 3 months. In cases such as this it is not exceptional the Court take a different position to the Advocate General.</p>  <p>  I do not intend to speculate on implications of the Court judgment in advance of the delivery of the judgment. </p></reply>

In this regard, I am advised that NAMA is confident it upheld its mandate on both of these transactions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the marketing process for the Project Aspen loan portfolio began in January 2013 when NAMA&rsquo;s loan sale adviser, Eastdil Secured, approached some 90 prospective investors.  29 prospective investors signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and were provided with access to due diligence material relating to the portfolio.  I am advised that 14 investors submitted first round offers by the deadline of 25 February 2013.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that NAMA, acting on the advice of its loan sale adviser, agreed that the top three credible bidders be invited to a second round of bidding and that they be provided with access to a detailed electronic data room.  I am advised by NAMA that two of the short-listed bidders submitted second round offers by the deadline of 2 April 2013 and that, on the advice of its loan sale adviser, NAMA entered into exclusive discussions with Starwood Capital Group which had submitted the highest bid after an open, transparent and competitive sales process.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that, on 2 May 2013, NAMA and Starwood Capital Group announced a joint venture relating to the sale of the Project Aspen portfolio.  Under the terms of the agreement, NAMA sold the loan portfolio to the new joint venture entity, which was 20% owned by NAMA and 80% owned by a consortium led by Starwood.  I am further advised that NAMA provided a senior secured loan (vendor finance) to the joint venture with an initial loan to value of less than 60%.  The loan carried a commercial rate of interest and has since been repaid. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's almost identical question on Project Nantes, I am advised that this transaction was in fact a debt refinancing transaction.  Under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is legally prohibited from disclosing information relating to its debtors or the assets securing their loans and, accordingly, NAMA is not in a position to disclose any additional information in relation to this transaction.</p></reply>

That view has been strongly endorsed by the NAMA Board.  Given that, I agreed with the NAMA Board in the context of NAMA's accelerated senior debt redemption target and its ancillary residential and commercial development funding activities, that a redundancy programme reflecting public sector norms and also comprising a retention payment element would be introduced to enable NAMA to retain key staff.</p><p>Retention payments are only made where staff are departing the organisation under the Agency's redundancy programme.Â  The retention payment for individual staff is dependent on NAMA achieving its targets and on satisfactory individual performance ratings. Â Redundancy dates are not &quot;voluntary&quot; in the ordinary sense as such dates are pre-agreed with staff as part of NAMA's wind down strategy. Â Payment will only be made if the staff member was retained and did not leave the organisation until the pre-agreed date.</p><p>I am advised by NAMA that since the redundancy and retention scheme was approved by the NAMA Board in late 2015, a total of 91 members of staff assigned to NAMA have been approved for the scheme. </p><p>AsÂ set out in previous responses to the D&aacute;il, most recently D&aacute;il Question 131 of 31 January 2017, the redundancy element is in keeping with established public sector norms; that is, two weeks statutory pay per year of service, capped at &euro;600 per week, plus three additional weeks of base salary per year of service with an overall cap of two years base salary.Â  </p><p>NAMA has also advised that the retention portion of the scheme is being implemented in line with the stipulated parameters, which I agreed with the NAMA Chairman in March 2015, regarding the quantum of any payment under the scheme, the timing of any such payment and employee eligibility under the scheme.  The underlying objective of the scheme is to help safeguard NAMA&rsquo;s performance in line with an orderly wind-down plan. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of employees who exited</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>50</td><td>&euro;3.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>41*</td><td>&euro;3.9 million*</td></tr></table></p><p>*the 2017 programme has not yet been finalised as employees continue to exit throughout 2017.

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions: </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  TheÂ criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.Â  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65.1 million in 2016.  This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.Â  </p>  <p>  IÂ recogniseÂ the important role that theÂ Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisisÂ despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.Â  From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit fromÂ the Scheme butÂ do not qualify under the six criteria.Â  While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I haveÂ no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

In line with this undertaking, section 56 of the Finance Act 2016 provides that, as and from following the voluntary disclosure deadline date, the making of a qualifying disclosure will not be permitted where the tax liabilities involved relate to offshore matters.  These matters include accounts held, property situated in, or income or gains arising or accruing in, a country or territory other than the State. Anybody who has tax liabilities of that kind and who has not acted to address them before the deadline faces the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as at 26 April, 532 disclosures relating to offshore matters had been received since 11 October 2016, resulting in payments to Revenue of &euro;13.6 million.  12 of those disclosures, giving rise to payments of &euro;231,543, were received between 11 October 2016 and the enactment of the Finance Act 2016 on 25 December 2016.</p>  <p>  I am advised also that, because the deadline of 30 April for making a qualifying disclosure relating to an offshore matter falls on the Sunday of a public holiday weekend, Revenue have decided to extend the period during which they will accept such disclosures until 5.30pm on Thursday 4 May 2017. </p>  <p>  A full analysis of disclosures received will be undertaken by Revenue after the deadline for receiving them has passed, and information about them and the related payments received will be made available when that work has been completed.</p>  <p>  The international environment is changing, with closer cooperation and information-sharing between tax authorities worldwide aimed at identifying those who seek to hide their profits or gains offshore.  Revenue is at the forefront of international developments for Automatic Exchange of Information, which include the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard, the EU&rsquo;s Directive on Administrative Cooperation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act initiative.  These initiatives will provide Revenue with considerable amounts of data about offshore accounts, structures and assets, and Revenue has advised me that they are committed to making full and effective use of this information to pursue rigorously anyone who attempts to use such means to evade their tax obligations.  I am advised also that cases will be investigated with a view to prosecution where the facts and circumstances warrant such a course of action.</p></reply>

Â VAT on these services is now chargeable where the consumer is located instead of where the supplier is located.Â  This ensures that the VAT goes to the Member State where the services are used and it removes the incentive for these businesses to locate themselves in low-VAT rate Member States. </p><p>As a result of the change, EU and non-EU businesses are required to register and account for VAT in every Member State in which they supply TBE services to consumers or, alternatively, to avail of the optional special scheme known as the MiniÂ One Stop Shop (MOSS).Â  MOSS is a simplification scheme that allows a business engaged in TBE supplies to register in a single Member State, to file a single quarterly return and pay its VAT liability for all Member States through a web portal in the Member State of registration.Â  This enables suppliers to avoid having to register and account for VAT in all the Member States to which they make TBE supplies.  Transitional rules for the period 2015-2018 provide that the Member State of registration may retain a percentage of the VAT collected for other Member States, with the retention percentage being 30% in 2015 and 2016 and 15% for 2017 and 2018.  Therefore the final retention fee payment in respect to VAT retained by Ireland from VAT revenues collected in respect of supplies to other Member States through the MOSS system for 2018 will be received in Quarter 1 2019.</p><p>Regarding Question 20237-17, I am informed by Revenue that the amount of VAT received between January and March 2017 in respect of electronic services provided to customers resident in other EU Member States is provided in the table.Â  </p><p>As the majority of MOSS returns and payments are received on a quarterly basis in the following month where the quarterly period has ended, the amounts collected under the MOSS system in April 2017 is not available at this time. </p><p>The total VAT collected by Revenue on behalf of other Member States in respect of supplies to the MOSS system is not included in the Exchequer Returns as Ireland is only entitled to retain a percentage of this VAT according to the EU VAT rules. Ireland&rsquo;s retention fee for Quarter 1 2017 will be included in the Exchequer Returns for May 2017.</p><p>As regards Question 20238-17, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is difficult to reliably estimate the amount of VAT retained by Ireland for 2017 and 2018 because business models can change and businesses can opt out of the MOSS system and register for VAT locally in other Member States.  Based on trends so far this year, the amount retained by Ireland could be around &euro;240 million in 2017.  However, it is too soon to know whether this pattern will continue.<table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Country</th><th>Amount Received (&euro;m)</th><th>Amount Retained (&euro;m)</th><th>Amount Due

It is my understanding that the bank has been consulting with staff representatives and hopes that the necessary staff reductions can be achieved on a voluntary basis by agreement.  I would urge both sides to work together to achieve agreement and to utilise the resources of the State industrial relations apparatus to do this if necessary.</p>  <p>  However, I should stress that the Irish Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of Ulster Bank, or any other bank, as to their future business model.  This is a matter for the Board and Management of a bank itself. </p>  <p>  The recent Ulster Bank closures are a response toÂ changingÂ ways of bankingÂ due to less useÂ of cash,Â increased use of technology and corresponding reduced visits to branches.  That said, IÂ expect that Ulster Bank will do everything that it can to mitigate the impacts of these branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.Â  I also expect that the bank will ensure that customers are kept informed about developments and provided with the appropriate assistance to move branches, switch to other banks and avail of alternative means of accessing financial services.  The Central Bank will also have a role in ensuring that consumer protection rules are followed.</p>  <p>  I understand that in all locations Ulster Bank are committed to working with the local community to ensure a service is maintained.Â  The bank has proposed how it will deal with continuity of service for its customers and this information will be made available to relevant customers.Â  In addition, I understand that the Bank is willing to talk to local representatives about any concerns they might have.</p>  <p>  Finally, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services.  It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit and that they continually assess their options to ensure that they are getting the best value and service possible.</p></reply>

As a consequence of the financial crisis, there was a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure so as to stabilise the country's public finances.  A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. </p></reply>

This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.  Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies, is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgment, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.</p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.</p></reply>

It is charged with, and is accountable for, the effective regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland, including responsibility for supervising compliance with the Act.  The PSI is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland.  This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.</p>  <p>  The changes in theÂ degree programme structure arise fromÂ the recommendations of the Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Reviews project and implementationÂ has been overseen by the National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation.Â  </p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules were signed by the Minister for Health in 2014.</p>  <p>  These Rules underpin the implementation of the new five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy which evolved from significant review of the previous training pathway, and international best practice assessment in this area.  They also gave effect to new accreditation standards that were developed by the PSI and place the Core Competency Framework for Pharmacists on a statutory footing.</p>  <p>  Moving to an integrated degree format which fully combines and integrates academic and workplace-based learning is designed to produce pharmacists who can more effectively contribute to patient care and understand the needs of the health system by having a more rounded &lsquo;whole system&rsquo; understanding of pharmacy practice across the diversity of settings in which pharmacy is practised.</p>  <p>  This change in the pharmacist qualification is designed to enable the pharmacists of the future to meet the changing needs of the healthcare system in Ireland.  The degree will also allow greater integration with the very successful pharmaceutical industry reflecting the Government&rsquo;s policy approach to the forging of strong partnerships with industry and collaborative links across academic institutions.  Furthermore, moving to an integrated degree structure is intended to bring the education and training of pharmacists more closely into line with the format of the other members of the healthcare team, i.e. medicine, nursing, allied health.</p>  <p>  The new five-year integrated Master&rsquo;s degree in pharmacy, delivered by the three schools of pharmacy in Ireland (TCD, RCSI, UCC), has been developed in line with best international practice.  It differs substantially from the former educational model, replacing the '4+1' structure that consists of a 4-year Bachelor pharmacy degree programme followed by a one-year internship programme or placement, with a fully integrated course structure.</p>  <p>  Further information in relation to these changes can be requested from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.783.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200076#WRP04000"><p>Special Needs Assistant (SNA)Â support is provided specifically to assist recognised primary, post primary and special schools to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils but to schools, as a school based resource.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all of the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupils disability categorisation. </p>  <p>  SNAs do not have a pedagogical role and it would not be appropriate for pupils with special educational needs to be taught by SNAs. Â The classroom teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need.Â  Additional teaching resources are alsoÂ allocated to mainstream schools to support pupils with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The NCSE have up to and including the current school year, also allocated Low Incidence Teaching Hours (LITH) to schools to support children who have an identified special educational need within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05, to which the Deputy refers.Â  </p>  <p>  The new model for allocating special education teachers to schools which has beenÂ introduced for the 2017/18 school year, replaces teaching resources allocated under the Low Incidence Teaching Hours and the General Allocation Model for primary schools.  The new modelÂ provides a single unified allocation of special educational teaching support to schools.Â  Allocations based on the school profiles issued to all schools on 7th March, details have also been published on the NCSE website.Â  My Department&rsquo;s Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools. </p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.Â  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.Â  </p>  <p>  The new model will give greater autonomy to schools to allocate resources to the pupils who most need these resources, regardless of their diagnosis.  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupilsÂ by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a parent is dissatisfied as to the extent of additional support teaching time which has been allocated to their child from within a schools allocation, the normal course of action open to a parent would be to raise this matter with the school Principal in the first instance, and to request that additional teaching be provided to their child.</p>  <p>  Â In the event that a parent raised an issue in relation to the allocation of additional support for their child with the school Principal, and remains dissatisfied with the manner in which the school Principal addressed their complaint, the next course of action open to the parent would be to raise this matter directly with the Board of Management of the School, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.Â </p></reply>

It recommended actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed. Implementation of the actions is ongoing and good progress has been made across all areas of the plan. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Action Plan my Department published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. </p><p>All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures. A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.</p><p>The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.</p><p>The anti-bullying procedures also include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>The procedures for schools put in place important new oversight arrangements at school level that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website. </p><p>There is no requirement on schools to report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department and therefore the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However,Â my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, in the course of their whole school inspection work, gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through:</p><p>- Review of relevant schoolÂ documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and Anti-BullyingÂ policy;</p><p>- Meetings with parents and student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and studentsÂ to raise issues where relevant and;</p><p>- The inclusion of parent and studentÂ Questionnaires on items relating to bullying. </p><p>Students and parents are asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying and discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. Where responses indicate that students and/or parent do not believe that bullying is dealt with effectively, Inspectors raise this issue with school management who have ultimate responsibility for Anti-Bullying policies and procedures.</p><p>The publication of the new procedures for schools represented just one of the twelve actions set out in the Action Plan on Bullying which was published in January 2013.Â Other actions that have beenÂ taken include:</p><p>- Support for anti-bullying awareness raising initiatives and the development and roll out of anti-bullying training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management;</p><p>- AÂ new national anti-bullying website, , wasÂ launched in November 2015. The website provides a single point ofÂ information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected byÂ bullying;</p><p>- My DepartmentÂ supportsÂ anti-bullying initiativesÂ aimed at young people suchÂ as, the StandUp! Against Homophobic andÂ Transphobic bullying campaign, organizedÂ by BeLonG To, the National Youth Service for Lesbian, Gay, BisexualÂ andÂ TransgenderÂ young people in Ireland and the Europe-wideÂ initiative,Â Safer InternetÂ Day;Â Â </p><p>- Since 2013 new resources toÂ tackle cyberbullyingÂ &ldquo;UP2US&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Selfie and theÂ widerÂ world&rdquo;Â and &ldquo;Lockers&rdquo; wereÂ launched through the internet safety initiative,Â Web wise.Â  </p><p>As outlined in the &quot;Action Plan for Education 2016-2019&rdquo;, my Department is committed to continuing implementation of the Anti-Bullying Action Plan through continued support for the development of anti-bullying training materials and awareness-raising initiatives.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling: </p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>My Department considers it essential that in assessing the need for special class placements the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there. This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>As you may be aware, the number of special classes has more than doubled, from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country now, of which 889 are special Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes. The number of special classes at post-primary level has doubled in the past three years and continues to rise rapidly. </p><p>With regard to the area mentioned by the Deputy, the NCSE has advised that there are 2 post primary ASD special classes in Col&aacute;iste Pobail Setanta, Phibblestown, Dublin 15. The NCSE has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are currently sufficient Post Primary ASD special class placements to meet existing demand in the area.</p><p>The NCSE will continue to engage with schools in the area in relation to opening additional Post Primary special classes as required.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.

The NCSE has advised thatÂ the school submitted an appeal to the NCSE in respect of the school's overall level of SNA supportÂ and the appealÂ was not upheld asÂ itÂ could only take account of the applications and the documentation that were available to theÂ NCSE at the time of the initial decision.Â Â The NCSE hasÂ also advised that followingÂ new applications for access to SNA support,Â  the SENO visited the school to conduct a care needs review and a letterÂ issued to the school in MarchÂ informing the school of anÂ increased allocationÂ toÂ 7.49 SNA posts. </p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2017/18 school year by 6thÂ April 2017.

Currently, that includes the requirement to provide a Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) programme for all students.  The RSE programme is delivered in the context of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) for students from primary to the end of Junior Cycle. Â A separate RSE Programme is in place for Senior Cycle. Â </p>  <p>  The right of schools to uphold their ethos and characteristic spirit is protected in a number of laws (Section 15.2 (b) of Section 7 ofÂ The Equal Status Act, 2000; for example) and it is recognised by my Department that RSE will be delivered within the characteristic spirit of the school.  The school&rsquo;s RSE policy, which should be developed and reviewed in partnership with parents and, as appropriate, students, should clarify how RSE is to be provided in accordance with the ethos of the school.  It remains a requirement, however, that all aspects of the RSE curriculum, including those in relation to sexual orientation, contraception, sexually transmitted infections etc should be covered.</p>  <p>  Through RSE, formal opportunities are provided for students to acquire knowledge and understanding of human sexuality.Â  While gender and gender orientation are not designated topics in the SPHE syllabuses, those syllabuses do provide opportunities for teachers to explore at an age appropriate level the questions set out in your email.Â  The topics included are intended to develop in students respect for one&rsquo;s own sexuality and the sexuality of others. Â </p>  <p>  The SPHE Support Service has worked collaboratively with GLEN and BelongTo and the HSE to develop a resource, &ldquo;Growing up lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender&rdquo; for use by RSE classes at both junior and senior cycle levels.  It includes lesson plans which will support students to achieve a better understanding of the concepts of gender identity and transgender.  The menu of in-service courses offered by the SPHE Support Service to schools also includes the topics of sexual orientation and homophobic bullying.</p>  <p>  There is the option to opt out of SPHE under Section 30.2 (e) of the Education Act 1998, which does not oblige any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student.</p></reply>

Any such visit must be carefully planned in advance in line with the relevant whole-school RSE programme and policies.</p>  <p>  - Talks/programmes delivered by outside agencies or speakers must be consistent with and complementary to the school's ethos and RSE programme. Visits should be planned, researched and implemented in partnership with school personnel.</p>  <p>  - Relevant teachers need to liaise with and be involved with all visitors and external agencies working with the school and the whole staff needs to be made aware of same.</p>  <p>  - It is strongly recommended that parents should be consulted and made aware of any such visiting people or agencies to classrooms / schools.</p>  <p>  - The school's RSE coordinator may also help in the process of whole-school planning and coordination to support the effective implementation of RSE.</p>  <p>  - It is of the utmost importance that classroom teachers remain in the classroom with the students and retain a central role in delivery of the core subject matter of the RSE programme. The presence of the classroom teacher should ensure that the school follows appropriate procedures for dealing with any issue(s) that may arise as a result of the external input(s).</p>  <p>  - All programmes and events delivered by visitors and external agencies must use appropriate, evidence-based methodologies with clear educational outcomes. Such programmes are best delivered by those specifically qualified to work with the young people for whom the programmes are designed.</p>  <p>  - All programmes, talks, interventions and events should be evaluated by students and teachers in terms of the subject matter, messages, structure, methodology and proposed learning outcomes.</p>  <p>  A review of the advice provided in this Circular, and in Circular 0022/2010 is provided in the Action Plan for Education 2017 (Action 1.3).Â  The purpose is to provide stronger more comprehensive guidance for schools on the effective use of external programmes.</p>  <p>  In addition to the detailed criteria given to schools about inviting visitors to the RSE classroom, my Department has also highlighted to schools that research findings indicate that the following teaching approaches have limited effect and are counterproductive to the effective implementation of RSE. Schools are advised to avoid the following approaches: scare tactics; sensationalist interventions; testimonials; information only interventions; information that is not age appropriate; once off/short term interventions; normalising young people's risky behaviour; and a didactic approach.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.Â Â The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.Â  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on. Â </p>  <p>  The agreements haveÂ restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.Â  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.Â  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.Â  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. AÂ broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.

My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with the broad range of problems, behavioural, emotional and social.Â The processes span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.</p>  <p>  The publications 'Wellbeing in Post Primary SchoolsÂ - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013)'Â and 'Wellbeing in Primary Schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015)' have been developed by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key education and health partners and by the findings of research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and wellbeing in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE Health Promoting Schools process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. Â In addition, Wellbeing guidelines have been produced to assist implementation from September 2017 of the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Programme. This will include a focus on mental health promotion. Continuing Professional Development is currently being provided forÂ schools in anticipation of this. </p>  <p>  A range of external resources and initiatives are available to assist schools in supporting various aspects of a positive mental health process or relating to suicide prevention and crisis intervention. It is a matter for schools to determine which of these resources they choose to access.Â  My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement theÂ Wellbeing guidelines effectively. When Â considering programmesÂ and materials or collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should be cognisant of my Department&rsquo;s Circular 0023/2010 which provides advice on best practice for Social Personal and Health Education.</p>  <p>  My Department isÂ currently liaising with the National Office for Suicide Prevention to introduce a training model for the delivery of the SafeTALK suicide prevention training through the Education Centre network, commencing in the 2017/18 school year.</p></reply>

It should be noted also that most of the properties are already in use by the intended recipients.</p>  <p>  The offers made in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report by many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, included cash and properties and were valued by the congregations at &euro;352.6m.Â I should stress that these offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement.</p>  <p>  One significant element of the 2009 offers, relating to playing fields and associated lands, valued at &euro;127million, was withdrawn by the Christian Brothers. When this is combined with some changes in the valuation of properties previously offered and the value of properties offered but not being reckoned as a contribution, the total value of the voluntary offers currently in place stands at &euro;193 million, of which contributions of cash and property amounting to some &euro;97.3 million have been realised. It is expected that the outstanding congregational cash contributions will be received by 2018.

It also took account of theexperience of the implementation of DEIS to date  from available and through comprehensive stakeholder consultation.</p><p>The DEIS Review consultation process noted stakeholder concerns about the use of educational outcomes as a basis for extending DEIS supports to schools, or for reducing such supports.  In particular it was felt that outcomes achieved due directly to the input of specific additional resources and supports should not be used as a means to remove these supports from schools.  It was considered that this would give rise to a perception of penalising success and rewarding failure.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, an identification process has been developed which uses CSO Small Area data as represented in the Haase Pratschke Index of Deprivation (HP Index) combined with DES Primary and Post Primary data supplied by schools. </p><p>There is a strong focus in DEIS Plan 2017 on supporting schools to achieve improved outcomes, rather than using those outcomes to determine the level of supports they might receive.</p><p>The use of the HP Index in the context of educational disadvantage is consistent with its use across a broad range of Government Departments, agencies and various public sector entities.  The index contains variables which provide a measure of the underlying risk of educational disadvantage and the exploratory analysis conducted by the Educational Research Centre shows that there is a moderate to strong correlation between scores on the HP index and poorer educational outcomes across the school spectrum, particularly in urban and post primary schools.  </p><p>It is important to note that as part of my announcement in February in launching DEIS Plan 2017, I made it clear that we would continue to conduct further analysis to examine other strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  In view of this, as set out in both the Report on the Review of DEIS and DEIS Plan 2017, the Technical Group will continue its work, supplemented as necessary by additional research and data expertise.  </p><p>A key objective of DEIS Plan 2017 is to achieve a more dynamic and tailored process for the assessment of schools which will more closely match resources to identified need.</p></reply>

That Agreement provided for a collective contribution of &euro;128 million in cash, counselling and property.</p>  <p>  In response to the call for further substantial contributions towards the costs of redress made in the aftermath of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (the Ryan Report), many of the congregations that were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement made individual offers of cash and/or property.  I should stress that these offers are voluntary and do not form part of any agreement.  The Congregation in question offered an additional cash contribution of &euro;5m, of which amount &euro;2m has been paid.  In 2012 the Congregation advised that it had decided to waive its claim for legal costs from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA) and to offset this claim against the remaining cash contribution of &euro;3m.  The then Government agreed to reckon this set-off as a contribution towards the redress response, the amount of which will be calculated by applying the average discount achieved by CICA on its respondent legal costs.  This exercise will be done once CICA has completed its work.  The Congregation was advised that in the event that the amount of the set-off calculated on that basis is less than the &euro;3m now outstanding the Government would expect it to make up the shortfall by way of a cash payment.</p>  <p>  For the sake of completeness I should point out that one property offered by the Congregation under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, the Sacred Heart Centre, Waterford, remains to be fully transferred.  The completion of this transfer is at an advanced stage and the intended final recipient, the Health Service Executive, is in occupation of the property.</p></reply>

This will be followed by a further assessment of all schools in Autumn 2017 which will provide the basis for the future allocation of resources including HSCL services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that there are a number of specific actions relating to the HSCL Scheme, and to future arrangements for the clustering of schools to receive such resources in the new DEIS Plan which I launched earlier this year.  Work on implementing these actions is being taken forward by my Department together with the Child and Family Agency Tusla which has responsibility for the management of the HSCL scheme, and our education partners including schools.</p></reply>

The purpose of the procedures is to give direction and guidance to school authorities in the implementation of Children First when dealing with allegations/suspicions of child abuse and neglect.</p>  <p>  The procedures make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed where there are reasonable grounds for concern that childrenÂ may have been abused or neglected, are being abused or neglected, or are at risk of abuse or neglect and the lead role of Tusla (the Child and Family Agency).</p>  <p>  Where there is a concern that a person poses a potentialÂ threat to public safety (including to the safety of a school&rsquo;s staff or pupils) the responsibility for dealing with such a situation rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with its duty to protect the community, to undertake criminal investigations and to bring offenders to justice.  In any case where a school is concerned about a threat to the safety of pupils or staff, it should ensure that it liaises closely with and follows the advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the safety and protection of its pupils and staff.  A school should also contact and seek the advice of Tusla in relation to any child protection issues arising and should ensure that any health and safety measures necessary in relation to protecting both staff and pupils are put in place.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has also provided all schools with guidelines and resource materials in relation to dealing with traumatic or critical incidents.

Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.</p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  AnÂ additional 900 teaching postsÂ have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additionalÂ teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocationÂ of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, this school had aÂ Learning SupportÂ allocationÂ ofÂ 19.8 hours for the 2016/17 school year, which combined withÂ 37.05Â resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education,Â gaveÂ a total allocation to the school ofÂ 56.85 additional teaching hours for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  As the profiled allocation for the school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school for 2017/18, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation.</p>  <p>  The special education teaching allocation for this school for 2017/18 isÂ 56.85 hours.</p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school.</p></reply>

Variables used in theÂ compilation of theÂ HP Index includeÂ those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, socialÂ class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p><p>Full details of the process involved in the assessment of schools is available on my Department's website at .</p><p>Schools included in the list published by my Department on 13th February are those whose level of disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  Schools whichÂ have not been included at this stage, including the one referred toÂ by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model.</p><p>It is important to note that this is a first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.</p><p>I am satisfied thatÂ the new DEISÂ Identification Model usedÂ to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach whichÂ has been uniformly applied for all schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy,Â in the country.</p><p>For schools who have concerns about their non-inclusion in the most recent round of DEIS, the following process applies:</p><p>- a verification process isÂ currently ongoing in relation to all schools who contacted my Department requesting that their data be validated.  This is aimed at ensuring the model was run correctly and the data supplied by the schools through the POD/PPOD systems was correctly used.  This process is expected to be concluded shortly and schools will be informed of the results.</p><p>- A further process will take account of updated data as it becomes available. All schools, not just those who queried the outcome of the February 2017 process, are being contacted to request them to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircodes. As soon as the 2016 National Census data becomes available later this summer, this data will be run through the identification model with the fully up-to-date POD/PPOD data.  If this exercise reveals that any school which did not qualify for DEIS in the February 2017 round actually meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the fully up-to-date information then it will be included, subject to resources.</p><p>My Department intends to make available to all schools information relating to the identification process and their own individual school data.  Arrangements for this are in hand and schools will be advised in due course.</p><p>I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communicationÂ to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model, includingÂ details ofÂ howÂ the datasetsÂ are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date informationÂ to my Department'sÂ online pupil databases.</p><p>The implementation of the new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model. The completion of this workÂ will inform ongoing provision and consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p></reply>

It is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL) that was adopted by Commission Decision in February 2015.  The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.</p>  <p>  The ESF Regulations provide for initial pre-financing/advances of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of between 2% and 3% payable from 2016 to 2023.  In May 2015 an amendment to the relevant EU Regulations resulted in an unprecedented increase in the YEI advances to be paid to Member States.  The Commission subsequently released pre-financing payments from the dedicated YEI budget line, worth 30% of the YEI budget, to provide additional financial liquidity to support YEI implementation. However, the relevant Regulations specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations also provide that annual pre-financing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  As Ireland did not submit an interim YEI payment application, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received was reimbursed to the Commission. Â Furthermore, as there was no ESF application made in 2016, the &euro;11.6m annual pre-financing for 2016,Â including &euro;1.36m for the YEI, will be offset against the 2017 pre-financing due.  The reimbursement of these amounts has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, as the YEI activities are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to them. The YEI funding is available for draw down before the end of 2018 and it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has advised that it obtained EU funding under the European Commission&rsquo;s call for proposals for preparatory actions under the Youth Guarantee Pilot, to pilot a Youth Guarantee Scheme in Ballymun which operated in 2014.  The total cost of the pilot was &euro;302,279 which included EU funding of &euro;250,000.</p></reply>

This includes an allocation of &euro;3 million under the European Structural Funds (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  SICAP is a separate and distinct programme which complements mainstream service provision through other Departments including, for example, some of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s programmes.</p></reply>

The European Union (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 282 of 2016) places a responsibility on the producers of bottled water to ensure the source is protected and sets the quality and the treatment standards for the final product.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the competent authority for enforcement of these Regulations.</p><p>The EPA has compiled a database of known water abstractions as part of the development of the draft River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021.  The database identifiesÂ twenty one bottled water plants across Ireland with production volumes ranging between 106Â cubic meters per day at the largest plant to just 41 litres per day at the smallest plant.  However, theseÂ amounts relate to the volume of the final product produced and do not take into account any water abstracted which might be used as part of the production process.</p><p>I have indicated my intention in the draft River Basin Management Plan which was published in February this year to bring forward legislative proposals to establish a comprehensive and maintained register of water abstractions greater than 25 cubic meters per day, and also to consult on a proportionate and risk-based framework for the regulation of water abstractions to ensure the continued sustainable use of our water resources.  The draftÂ River Basin Management Plan is currently undergoing public consultation which remains open until 31 August 2017.

SignificantÂ results are already being achieved in this regard, with housing authorities achieving over 3,000 sustainable exits from homeless accommodation into independent tenancies during 2016, a record level of exits in a calendar year.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are also pursuing a range of new emergency accommodation facilities that can be usedÂ as an alternative to hotels, to accommodateÂ households duringÂ periods of homelessness.  These supportedÂ accommodation initiatives willÂ provide temporary accommodation for homeless families with a greater level of stability, services and supportsÂ thanÂ are availableÂ in hotel accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.</p>  <p>  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services, including emergency accommodation, rests with the individual housing authorities.  In that context, it will be a matter for housing authorities, in the first instance, to consider the appropriate accommodation solutions for each individual family.  However, my Department continues to engage proactively with the various local authorities in relation to funding the delivery of a range of identified temporary accommodation arrangements for homeless families.</p></reply>

In recognition of both the critical demand for additional units and the potential the RLS scheme has to offer, I have assigned additional fundingÂ to the scheme in 2017, bringing the total amount of investment available this year to &euro;32m, which will facilitate up to 800 vacant properties being brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In the period since the launch of the scheme,Â my Department has been engaging bilaterally with local authorities and AHBs, including KildareÂ County Council,Â toÂ provide support and assistanceÂ in the implementation of the scheme.  Two workshopsÂ have beenÂ convened to introduce the scheme toÂ local authority and AHB staff and toÂ provide practicalÂ information and assistanceÂ onÂ how best to develop the RLS in their areas.  A detailed guidance document, template legal agreements, application formsÂ and other resources have alsoÂ been made available toÂ local authoritiesÂ and AHBs in order to assist in the implementation of the scheme and minimiseÂ the impact of the scheme on existing resources.</p>  <p>  In addition, theÂ RLS has been designed to draw on the expertise and experienceÂ gained byÂ AHBs on social housing acquisitions and leasingÂ in recent years and it is open to local authorities to work in collaboration with AHBs in their areas to maximise the potential impact of the scheme.  However, local authoritiesÂ retain overall responsibility for the implementation of the scheme in their area and for ensuring that housing units brought into use under the scheme are required and fulfil social housing demand in their areas.  Where collaboration with AHBs is facilitated, local authorities then have increased capacity to focus on core construction programmes, land management and mixed tenure goals.  The delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland is focussed on a need to acknowledge the blend of delivery routes available and to harness the maximum capacity of all stakeholders operating in the sector.</p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  It is therefore, a matter for each individual Chief Executive to apply for sanction from my Department and, once approved, to recruit and assign staff to specific divisions within their organisation.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with all local authorities in relation to their staffing requirements.  Staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints.</p>  <p>  I understand that no requests for additional staffing related to the implementation of the RLS have been received in my Department from Kildare County Council.  However, my Department would look favourably if any such request was to be received, and is happy to continue working closely with the local authority as the scheme continues to establish momentum.</p></reply>

Irish Water as a single national utility is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.</p>  <p>  Under the Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013, Irish Water is required to consult with a number of stakeholders, including local authorities, when preparing an Investment Plan. Accordingly, Irish Water undertook formal consultations on the emerging Investment Plan with a wide range of stakeholders, including all statutory consultees such as local authorities, the Public Water Forum, and those recommended by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  In addition to the formal consultation with local authorities, I understand that workshops were held with water services personnel during the summer of 2016 as part of the development of the Investment Plan, which contributed to the development of Irish Water&rsquo;s understanding of the asset base and identification of needs across the water supply and wastewater infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  In providing these services Irish Water plays a central role in enabling economic growth, protecting both the environment and the health and safety of its customers and the public.</p>  <p>  Following decades of under-investment, there are now many competing investment needs across the State.  Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan is an important part of the process of meeting this investment need in a balanced way.  In a constrained funding environment, Irish Water needs to understand and consider all available views in order to ensure thatÂ available investment is appropriately balancedÂ across competing areas. Consequently Irish Water must take a number of considerations into account when weighing up the relative merits of investment needs.</p>  <p>  It is an objective of Irish Water that the interventions in its Investment Plan should be balanced across the various drivers including supporting future population growth, economic development, provision of safe and secure drinking water supplies, minimising the impact of wastewater discharges on the environment and maintaining the Irish Water asset base.</p>  <p>  The Investment Plan sets out the approach taken to optimise intervention options by examining their contribution to specific performance targets.  Irish Water has taken on board and responded to the consultation process undertaken in setting very challenging targets for the Investment Plan 2017-2021, such as:</p>  <p>- reducingÂ the number of Boil Water Notices in place for greater than 200 days fromÂ over 4,000 to zero;</p>  <p>- reducing the number of schemes onÂ the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s Remedial Action List from 71 to zero;</p>  <p>- increasing compliance with the parameters for Lead in Drinking Water from an estimated 85% to 98%;</p>  <p>- reducing network leakage volume by 180 Megalitres per day;</p>  <p>- rationalisationÂ of 105 Water Treatment Works;</p>  <p>- increasingÂ the Population Equivalent (PE) served by Wastewater Treatment Works compliant with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive from 2.4m to 4.8m;</p>  <p>- reducingÂ the number of public wastewater agglomerations with no-treatment from 37Â to zero.</p>  <p>  This investment balancing process towards the achievement of challenging targets is a key element of the value Irish Water brings as a single national utility.</p></reply>

VAT).</p><p>The main aim of the consultation, communication and engagement strategy is to ensure that the momentum for implementation is maintained throughout the life of the Plan.  A key part of the successful implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is to ensure that all stakeholders and the wider public are fully aware of the commitments, understand the range of initiatives and actions being rolled out and can access relevant and up-to-date information on progress.</p><p>A number of initiatives have been put in place, aimed at maintaining and updating the information flow and providing a forum or point of contact for feedback, where needed.  For example, a dedicated website,<i>www.rebuildingireland.ie,</i>has been put in place and a dedicated email address,<i>rebuildingireland@housing.gov.ie</i>has also been created.  The total investment to date in the development and management of this website has been approximately &euro;54,600 (incl. VAT).</p><p>In addition to the standard provision of text and graphic information to view and download, the website facilitates engagement with the general public through the use of video presentations,Â social media and the inter-active State land map, at a cost of approximately &euro;38,900 (incl. VAT) to date. It is important to note that the video production costs include filming and content generation resources that may be used in future video presentations, thus potentially reducing the costs of future requirements in this area.</p><p>Pillar specific launches have also taken place to build implementation momentum by allowing for a deeper focus on a specific pillar area, and elaboration of the actions being taken.  Four Pillar launches have taken place to date and the location and cost of each is set out in the following table.  A similar launch for theÂ Pillar 5, Utilise Existing Housing, will take place in due course.<table><tr><th>Pillar</th><th>Launch Date</th><th>Venue</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>1: Address Homelessness</td><td>22 September 2016</td><td>Government Press Centre</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2: Accelerate Social Housing</td><td>6 October 2016</td><td>Charlemont Community Centre, Dublin 2</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>3: Build More Homes</td><td>10 November 2016</td><td>Green Isle Hotel, Naas Road, Dublin 22</td><td>&euro;2,200 (roomÂ hire and associated costs)</td></tr><tr><td>4: Improve the Rental Sector</td><td>13 December 2016</td><td>Government Press Centre</td><td>Nil</td></tr></table>There has also been a series of local authority-hosted regional events to stimulate and encourage active involvement and early engagement by all key stakeholders at local and regional levels.</p><p>Further requirements in terms of the website, video production and social media services for the next twelve-month period, are currently being considered.  All efforts will continue to be made to keep expenditure in connection with Rebuilding Ireland to a minimum.</p><p>Further information in relation to the Consultation, Communication and Engagement Strategy and in relation to progress more generally under Rebuilding Ireland is available in theÂ Second Quarterly Progress Report on the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, which was published on 7 February 2017 and can be accessed at: <i>.</i></p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  In this regard, the Government approved the drafting of a Rates Bill at its meeting on 11 April 2017.  These proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in due course.</p>  <p>  The Debt Management Project ImplementationÂ Board, on which my Department and the Local Authority SectorÂ were represented,Â was established byÂ theÂ Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformÂ in February 2015, to progress the recommendations of theÂ Debt Management Review, which was published in 2014.

This business case was endorsed by the Project Board.  Provision for strenghtenedÂ enforcement powers for local authorities are included in the legislative proposals recently approved by the Government.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs - up to a maximum of &euro;40,000 -Â will be met upfront by the relevantÂ local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  As part of the agreement, the property owner then leases the dwelling to the localÂ authority for use as social housing for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs butÂ subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs isÂ offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p>  <p>  Other initiatives to utilise vacant housing stockÂ for social housing include the Buy and Renew Scheme.  The full details of this scheme are being finalised and will be communicated to local authorities shortly.

Furthermore, if a property owner wishes to explore making their property available to a local authority for social housing use using a range of other lease or rental options, theyÂ shouldÂ similarly contact their local authority.

There are currently moreÂ than 20,700 households in receipt of HAP, including 7,000 households that were previously supported by Rent Supplement.</p>  <p>  One of the key principles of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice, as provided for under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  This is distinct from other forms of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find theirÂ own accommodation and insteadÂ are allocated a dwelling.  Under the Homeless HAP scheme, which is operated by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive on behalf of the 4 Dublin local authorities, a place finder service has been provided to assist homeless households with sourcing HAP accommodation.  A similar service will be available to homeless households in the Cork City Council area from 8 May 2017.  Given that to date in 2017, an average of almost 350 additional households a week are being supported by HAP, I consider the practice of households sourcing their own accommodation under the scheme to be an effective approach to providing housing support, as it gives households choice.</p>  <p>  There is no limitation on the length of a tenancy that can be supported by the HAP scheme.  HAP supported tenancies are agreed between the landlord and the tenant; the local authority is not a party to the tenancy and has no role in its agreement.  However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) governs the relationship between the landlord and the tenant.  The length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant.  My Department does not hold information in relation to the length of individual tenancies.</p>  <p>  Where a HAP supported tenancy comes to an end, the tenant can find alternative accommodation and retain their eligibility for HAP support or the local authority may decide to offer another form of social housing support to the tenant in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.</p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2016, all local authorities have been provided with a statutory discretion to exceed HAP rent limits by up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  At the end of Q1 2017, 9.5% of the total number of households (excluding qualified homeless households) being supported by HAP had some additional flexibility applied to the monthly HAP payment being made to their landlord on their behalf. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In general, I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP scheme and I consider itÂ to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious delivery programme committed to under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable, including Family Income Supplement.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and housing authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off.</p>  <p>  A review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 is scheduled to commence later this year.</p></reply>

The results of the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments carried out in 2016 provide updated figures on the number of households who qualified for social housing support across each housing authority, including the number of qualified households whose housing need arose from homelessness.  The full results of the 2016 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>Homelessness is a complex phenomenon which is usually the result of a number of inter-related issues, often including complex personal problems, mental health, addiction, relationship breakdown, family issues, domestic violence, financial loss, economic insecurity, rent arrears, tenancy issues, anti-social behaviour, the vulnerability of migrants, etc.  The myriad of issues contributing to homelessness mean that it is of limited value to attempt to classify incidence of homeless presentation to a single causative factor.  It is generally accepted that the supply shortage across the housing sector, which in turn is a result of the economic collapse and the associated contraction in the construction sector, has been a driving force behind the increased number of families and individuals presenting as homeless in recent times.</p><p>Recent housing authority analysis into reasons for homeless presentations by families identifies two broad categories: departure from private rented accommodation, primarily following receipt of a &lsquo;notice to quit&rsquo;, and family circumstances which includes both relationship breakdown and overcrowding.  As noted, it is overly simplistic to classify presentation by a single causative factor and it is likely in many cases that underlying reasons overlap.  This analysis corresponds with recent independent surveys carried out by homeless service providers. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.1189.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200083#WRX02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455, 456, 476 to 480, inclusive, 492 to 494, inclusive, and 502 together.</p>  <p>  The recording and reporting of statistics on housing activity is a complex matter that involves tracking a range of different indicators &ndash; including planning permissions, commencement notices, ESB connections and several others - from various sources, each of which measure different aspects of housing market activity.  Each dataset presents part of the overall housing activity picture but none of the datasets were specifically designed to count new houses.</p>  <p>  Since the 1970s,Â my Â Department has published ESB data on residential properties connected to the ESB grid, as a proxy for house completions, as it represents the best available indicator that a residential unit is becoming available for occupation.  This dataset includes recently completed once-off homes, multi-unit scheme developments and apartments as well as some reconnections to the grid, where properties that have been unoccupied for over two years are being brought back into use.Â  </p>  <p>  ESB data are collected atÂ a point in timeÂ when the home is connected to the grid and bears no relationship to the period of its construction.  My Department has regularly drawn attention to this fact in the context of the recent economic and construction collapse where many homes commenced beforeÂ 2008 butÂ remained unfinished for several years and haveÂ gradually been finished out and brought to the marketplace as recovery tookÂ hold.  Indeed, for a number of years my Department has published the results of annual surveys undertaken in relation to unfinished housing developments, including details in relation to the progress on completion of such developments.</p>  <p>  In this context the Department has published data indicating that, based on ESB connections, 12,666 homes became available in 2015, 14,932 homes in 2016 and, based on current trends, it is anticipated that this figure will rise to 18,000 homes in 2017.  The Department is working closely with the ESB in an attempt to obtain additional, more granular data fromÂ its dataset toÂ get a furtherÂ and deeper understanding of the various components of the overall connection data.Â </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the ESB figures are by no means the only dataset used to measure housing activity.  For example, detailed information on residential construction activity is available from certain local authoritiesÂ - at the end of 2016, the four Dublin local authorities reported 144 active construction sites, encompassing the construction of some 5,200 new dwellings.  This is a really important source of information in terms of informing policies aimed at increasing supply in the key Dublin housing market.Â  </p>  <p>  In relation to theÂ Building Control Management System (BCMS), it is important to note that the BCMS was introduced with effect from 1 March 2014 to facilitate building control authorities, building owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990, as amended.  The building control process includes a requirement, in certain circumstances, to lodge a statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion (CCC) in respect of buildings, including dwellings.  While this represents another useful source of data on residential completions, it also has a number of limitations in this regard.  Firstly, CCCs apply only to works commenced on or after 1 March 2014 and so would not apply to homes completed at a current date which were subject to a commencement notice submitted prior to 1 March 2014.  Secondly, one-off houses were given the facility to opt out of the statutory CCC process on and from 1st September 2015, so not all single homes constructed will appear in these returns.  Finally, a CCC may cover multiple buildings or works, so the number of CCCs registered on the BCMS does not correlate to the number of building units completed.  My Department is actively engaging with the Local Government Management Agency, which hosts the BCMS, with a view to developing its potential further as an additional source of data in relation to house building activity.Â Â  </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office, which is the State&rsquo;s authoritative voice in relation to the provision of high quality and independent statistical information supporting evidence-based decision-making, established an independent group in January 2017, chaired by an Assistant Director General, to examine housing statistics andÂ my Department is a member of that group.Â  This group is considering the best analytical approaches to reconciling and combining datasets in this area and will have oversight of, and a direct involvement in, the examination of any output arising from the variety of analyses currently underway.Â Â Â  </p>  <p>  MyÂ Department has also established a new Housing Data Analytics Group, with membership from the CSO, Central Bank, local authorities and others to examine this complex area and to monitor and review the various sources of data collected nationally to provide a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.</p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additionalÂ housing at considerable scale and at more affordable price points,Â with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals in October 2016.  Kildare County Council submitted 7 proposals in respect of Naas, Kildare, Maynooth, Newbridge, Celbridge, Leixlip and Sallins.  On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects underÂ LIHAF.  The cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, of which &euro;169.65 millionÂ will be funded by the Exchequer, with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.81 million.  These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.Â  </p>  <p>  Kildare County Council has received approval for the proposals at Maynooth, Naas and Sallins.  The total cost of these projects is &euro;21.43 million, of which &euro;16.07 million will be funded by my DepartmentÂ with Kildare County Council providing the balance ofÂ &euro;5.36 million.  These projects are expected to deliver 1,850 housing units by 2021 and have the potential to provide 4,850 housing units in the longer term, with a strong focus on affordability. Â Â </p>  <p>  I am seeking additional funding for LIHAF under theÂ  Mid-term Review of theÂ Capital Plan 2016-2021, but it will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider in the context of other demands for theÂ capitalÂ funds available.  In the event that more funds are secured, local authorities will be able to resubmit proposals, including in relation to Celbridge,Â that did not receive funding or to advance other new proposals that would meet LIHAF objectives.</p></reply>

In 2008, retained fire fighters were given the option of joining the Local Government Superannuation Scheme (LGSS) and receive a pension and retirement lump sum based on their pensionable remuneration and length of service.  Where a retained fire fighter, who is a member of the Scheme, retires on their compulsory retirement age, the lump sum and LGSS part of their pensionÂ are immediately payable.  Any social welfare element of their pension will be payable at State pension age.  Retained fire fighters attendance is part-time on a &ldquo;fire call out&rdquo; basis and many of the fire fighters are employed separately on a whole-time basis in other employments, some are self-employed and others are whole-time local authority employees.  These employees can of course continue in their working lives outside of the retained fire services.</p>  <p>  Only a very small percentage of retained fire fighters chose to join the LGSS in 2008.  Those retained fire fighters who opted not to join will not receive a pension.  On retirement, a non-pensionable gratuity of 1/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer) is payable to this group. </p>  <p>  All retained fire fighters appointed after 1 January 2013 must join the Single Public Service Pension Scheme and are subject to the rules of that Scheme at retirement.  This Scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role.Â </p><p>The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p><p>A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters.  The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 year of age.  Following the report of the Expert Group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by myÂ Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.</p><p>In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established Industrial Relations processes. </p></reply>

Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p><p>In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land inÂ public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  Full details of these sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map at the following link: .</p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites.  The final model for each siteÂ will beÂ the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area.  Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.Â  </p></reply>

In all negotiations, the Government will strive to ensure that the best possible outcomes will be achieved for our citizens, for the economy, for Northern Ireland and for the Common Travel Area. </p><p>While the specific impact of Brexit will be determined by the nature of the new relationship between the EU and the UK, the extent thatÂ this will affect demand for housing units is subject to some uncertainty, given the range of variables involved.  However, my priority, as Minister with responsibility for housing and planning, is to ensure that all reasonable steps are being taken to secure the required increase in housing supply to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2021.Â </p><p>In that regard, theÂ Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness contains a suite of responses to addressÂ the many interacting structural constraints that have hindered increased supply to date.  Under the Plan, aÂ range of actions, such as planning reforms, investment inÂ infrastructure, and land supply initiatives,Â isÂ being implemented to make residential property delivery viable at a far greater scale and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  A copy of Rebuilding Ireland and reports on progress to date under the Plan can be accessed at the following link .</p><p>With regard to ensuring sufficient supply in Dublin, my Department works closely with the four Dublin local authorities, through the governance arrangements under Rebuilding Ireland and, more specifically, through the Dublin Housing Supply Coordination Task Force which was established to address supply-related issues to the delivery of homes in the Dublin region.  The Task Force comprises representatives from my Department, the Chief Executives of the four Dublin local authorities, NAMA, and other agencies.  Its remit includes monitoring relevant housing data on the supply of viable and market-ready approved developments in the region.</p><p>In that regard, in its report for Quarter 4 2016, the Taskforce reports a total of 144 active residential development construction sites across Dublin, which will deliver some 5,200 homes.  The full report can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>Furthermore, under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland,Â entitledÂ &ldquo;Building More Homes&rdquo;, I have identifiedÂ 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites (MUHDS) with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes, 20,000 of which will be in Dublin, on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand, over the next three to four years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.  Full details of these sites can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>In addition,Â to relieve critical infrastructural blockages, to enable the accelerated delivery of housing on these and other key sites, I established the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).  On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects under the LIHAF.  The cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, &euro;112.72 million of which has been allocated toÂ 12 projects across the 4 Dublin local authorities.  These projects are expected to enable delivery ofÂ approximately 13,500 homes in Dublin by 2021, with the potential to provide around 37,500 homes in the longer term, with a strong focus on affordability.  The overall increase in supply should also help ease the pressure on rented accommodation.  Further details in relation to these LIHAF projects can be found at .</p><p>Separately, the NTMA and ISIF are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas with a view to kick starting the development process.</p><p>In addition, an importantÂ policy intervention inÂ the delivery ofÂ new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding IrelandÂ is the development of State-ownedÂ lands for mixed-tenure housing,Â particularlyÂ in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  Last week, I published details ofÂ some 2,000 hectares of land inÂ public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  Some 350Â hectares ofÂ this landÂ is located in the Dublin region.  Full details of theseÂ sites can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing LandÂ Map at the following link: .</p><p>I have asked all local authorities to be innovative and proactive in developing these sites.  The final model for each siteÂ will beÂ the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area.  Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliverÂ around 3,000 mixed tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.Â  </p><p>The Government is focused on ensuring that the unique circumstances of Ireland and its particular concerns arising from Brexit continue to be understood and addressed.  A Brexit co-ordinator has been appointed in my Department to support the management of any impacts of Brexit on the business ofÂ my Department and to liaise with the Departments of An Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p><p>I continue toÂ work withÂ all stakeholders and delivery agentsÂ to build on the progress achieved to date under the Rebuilding Ireland programme, to further accelerate output in order to achieve moderated rents and house prices, and will continue to keep the potential housing-related impacts of Brexit under ongoing review according as the Brexit negotiations progress over the next 2 years.</p></reply>

Arising from the Social Housing Strategy, targets and provisional funding allocations were notified to each local authority from 2015 out to end-2017.  These targets are available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>.  Now, with the increased national targets under Rebuilding Ireland, increased targets beyond 2017 will be set for all local authorities.  These will be based on the results of the most recent statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments, published in late 2016, so that delivery and resources can be aligned with the up-to-date priority housing needs locally.  I anticipate these new targets for individual local authorities will be finalised later in Q2 2017.</p><p>In relation to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), thisÂ is now available to all eligible households throughout theÂ State.  HAP is a flexible and immediate housing support that allowsÂ households to find accommodation suitable to their needs in an area of their choice.  While individual allocations are not made to local authorities under the scheme, Budget 2017 has increased funding for HAPÂ from a provisional outturn of &euro;57 million in 2016 to an Exchequer allocation of &euro;152.7 million in 2017.  This level of support Â is currently providing Â housing support to 20,700 households across all local authority areas, with more than 315 additional households beingÂ supported by the scheme each week.  Rebuilding Ireland has set a target of supporting 15,000 additional households through HAP in 2017.</p><p>I have published a comprehensive status list of social housing schemes that are advancing nationwide, which can be accessed at the following link:Â  .  This status report lists the 504 approved social housing construction projects and their locations and contains a range of information relating to their advancement, including those delivered in 2016 and those progressing through planning, design and construction.  Funding is provided to local authorities in line with their advancement of projects through construction.  Accordingly, the level of funding that was provided in 2016 and to be provided in 2017 to local authorities for their social housing delivery activity is directly linked to the scale of delivery they achieve on these projects.  I am keen that these projects are advanced as soon as possible and have assured local authorities that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides for consideration, with all stakeholders, as toÂ how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.</p>  <p>  The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided by credit unions to Approved Housing Bodies for the development of social housing.  My Department and the Department of Finance have met with the ILCU on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of financing social housing delivery.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  My Department and the Department of Finance have met with the Central Bank to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by the ILCU, with the support of their members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department will continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing.  The potential scope for credit union involvement is being examined in developing the proposed new mortgage to rent pilot scheme arising from the review of the existing scheme published in February 2017.  My colleague Minister of State English, and my Department, have met with credit union representatives to consult on the potential for their involvement in the proposed pilot scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.</p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum period of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.  Following on from the success of the initial RLS pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the pilot was expanded on a national basis from 23 February 2017 and is now available in all local authorities.</p>  <p>  In recognition of both the critical demand for units and the potential the RLSÂ has to offer, I assigned anÂ additional &euro;26m to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are best placed to determine the availability of potential units in their local areas.  Therefore,Â funding to support the RLS will be provided based on proposals submitted by local authorities to my Department rather than by individual allocation to each local authority.  Local authoritiesÂ have been provided with delegated authority to enter into contractual arrangements in respect of potential units.  MyÂ Department will be closelyÂ monitoring this activityÂ to ensure thatÂ the schemeÂ works well; that the funding I have made available is utilised effectively; and ultimately, that new social houses are delivered using the scheme in 2017.</p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy, informed by Census 2016 data, to:</p>  <p>  - inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p>  <p>  - identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p>  <p>  - set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into re-use.</p>  <p>  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, established a working group in September 2016, comprisingÂ senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  The Working Group is presently concluding its deliberations onÂ recommendations to be incorporated in the Strategy, with a view to facilitating and incentivising the greater re-utilisation of vacant properties.  While a short delayÂ arose,Â as the Group awaited the publication of 2016 Census data on housing on 20th April to ensure access to the most up-to-date and comprehensive data, it is expected that the Strategy will beÂ published later this month.</p></reply>

Guidelines entitled &ldquo;Rent Assessment, Collection, Accounting and Arrears Control&rdquo; were published by the Housing Unit (which subsequently became part of the Housing Agency) in January 2001.  These guidelines, developed in conjunction with my Department and the City and County Management Association, set out good practice in the administration of rent related matters.  The Guidelines stated that local authorities should review the rent assessment of all existing tenants at least annually to ensure that all tenants are paying the correct rent and to update rents to reflect changes in tenants&rsquo; incomes and in housing management costs.</p>  <p>  It will normally be a part of the tenancy agreement that the tenant should inform the local authority of any change in circumstances, including increases in family income.  When this is done by the tenant, any change in rent that is warranted can be applied promptly.</p>  <p>  The above Guidelines also state that arrangements for the repayment of rent arrears should be determined primarily by the tenants&rsquo; ability to pay.</p>  <p>  Section 31Â of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme.  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  This includes providing for a common set of income disregards to be applied by all housing authorities in determining a household&rsquo;s assessable income for rent calculation purposes.</p>  <p>  These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall aim is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market,Â taking account ofÂ the range of approaches to differential rents that have become established in different local authority areas.  This review is scheduled to be completed before the end of Quarter 2 2017.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and investigation.  Neither I nor my Department has any role in relation to enforcement matters and it is important to clarify that the Department has no statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwelling houses, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>  However, in the interests of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, a review was undertaken by an independent fire safety expert to develop a framework for general application in such situations.  The independent fire safety expert has now completed this task and a report on the matter has been received in my Department.  The report remains under consideration pending clarification on a number of issues at which point it is intended that the arrangements necessary for publication will be made.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme, which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website (www.pyriteboard.ie).</p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.</p>  <p>  Given that the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Board does not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware thatÂ 11 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.  Further information on the extent of the pyrite problem is provided in theÂ  Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012).</p>  <p>  In general terms, the cost of pyrite remediation is largely dependent on the dwelling type, the number of units in a project, the floor area of the dwellings, the depth of hardcore in the units and the presence or otherwise of under-floor heating systems.  Against this background, remediation costs can vary significantly and may not always be directly comparable across projects.  While my Department monitors overall expenditure under the scheme, the costs associated with individual projects are determined by on-going competitive procurement processes, which fall within the remit of the Housing Agency.  However the average cost of remediation having regard to those dwellings already remediated, is some &euro;59,000, inclusive of the allowances provided under the scheme for alternative accommodation, furniture removal and storage and Building Condition Assessments.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Following on from the success of the initial RLS pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the pilotÂ was expanded on a national basis from 23 FebruaryÂ 2017 and is now available in all local authorities.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided local authorities with detailed guidance documents, template legal agreements, application formsÂ and other resourcesÂ to assist them to implement the scheme together with AHBs, locally.  In addition, two workshops for local authority and AHB staff have already been convened which were well attended.</p>  <p>  In recognition of both the critical demand for additional units and the potential the RLS scheme has to offer, IÂ assigned additional fundingÂ to the scheme in 2017, bringing the total amount of investment available this year to &euro;32m.  ThisÂ will facilitate up to 800 vacant properties being brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  I have urged local authorities to see the opportunity that this scheme offers, and I am keen that properties and property owners interested in the scheme are identified and progress madeÂ immediately.</p>  <p>  Property owners who wish to avail of the RLS are asked toÂ contact their local authority for further information on the scheme in their area.</p></reply>

In this regard, there is noÂ statutory consultation or discussion based processÂ with land owners, developers or public representatives in respect of proposals to zone landsÂ outside theÂ development plan making process.</p>  <p>  It is within the development plan process, which is approved by the elected members of the authority within an overall open and transparent and recorded process, thatÂ overall strategies for proper planning and sustainable developmentÂ of relevant areas are prepared.  The legislation provides for extensive consultation in relation to the development plan, both with the general public and certain prescribed bodies, who are offered the opportunity to make submissions or observations prior to the making of the draft development plan, and on the draft plan when it has been made, submissions which must be considered by the planning authority.  The making of a development plan, theÂ public consultation process around the making of the plan and the procedures for recording the decision making processÂ are set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p>  <p>  In addition to the planning process, Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 sets out an ethical framework for all those involved in theÂ local government service, both elected members and employees.  This framework imposes a statutory duty on all in the service to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.</p>  <p>  The statutory requirements are complemented by two Codes of Conduct, one for elected members and one for employees.  The purpose of the Codes is to set out standards and principles of conduct and integrity, to inform the public of the conduct it is entitled to expect, and to maintain and enhance public trust and confidence in local government.  The Codes make specific reference to planning matters and emphasise the importance of transparency and following due process within the requirements of the statutory planning framework.</p>  <p>  The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 serves to provide information to the public about lobbying activities including those engaged in lobbying,Â on whose behalf lobbying is being carried out, the issues involvedÂ and intended results.  Through the www.lobbying.ie website,Â advice and written guidance has been providedÂ on the functioning of the Act and with specificÂ regard to the planning process,Â including the types of communications involvedÂ and designated public officialsÂ relevant to the Act.  Where lobbying activities defined under the ActÂ with designated public officials are being engaged inÂ by lobbyists, which may include planning matters, then the Act requires that the lobbyists involved must provide information at regular intervals about their lobbying activities to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p></reply>

On 27 April 2017, I published details of some 2,000 hectares of land inÂ public ownership, which has the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.

Indeed, the Dublin local authorities are well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing, with projects advertised that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas alone.</p><p>Other measures being taken to increase the supply of housing include -</p><p>- &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund;</p><p>- National Treasury Management Agency financing of large-scale &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; infrastructure;</p><p>- Planning Reforms;</p><p>- Putting in place a National Planning Framework and land management actions;</p><p>- Efficient design and delivery methods to lower housing delivery costs;</p><p>- Measures to support construction innovation and skills;</p><p>- The enhanced supply of more affordable starter homes in key locations through a targeted rebate of development contributions in Dublin and Cork for housing supplied under certain price levels;</p><p>- New National Apartment Planning Guidelines, reducing the cost of apartment building;</p><p>- Changes to aspects of the operation of Strategic Development Zones to enable swifter adjustments to meet market requirements;</p><p>- A vacant sites levy.</p><p>Pillar 4 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan, entitled Improve the Rental Sector, provided for the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the capacity of the private rented sector to provide quality and affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.</p></reply>

The Government took the decision to designateÂ PoolbegÂ West as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ)Â because of its potential to deliver a large amount ofÂ extra homes in the centre of our capital and on an excellentÂ site.  The process has moved forward with Dublin City Council&rsquo;s publication of a draft planning scheme for the area under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  As part of the public consultation exercise on the preparation ofÂ the draft planning scheme, my Department has indicated thatÂ theÂ planningÂ schemeÂ could include a policy mechanism where, on an agreed basis, over and above the statutory requirement that 10% of the housing yield of the site be reserved for social housing under Part V of the Act,Â there would be delivery of up to another 10% of its housing yield, which would be accessible in economic terms for households on average industrial wages, in return for flexibility around the overallÂ development yield on the site.</p>  <p>  My Department's submission also pointed towardsÂ a number of delivery models, if such an agreement could be brokered between the owners of theÂ site and the local authority and supported by my Department.  These modelsÂ include the potential role of the voluntary housing sector in participating in a joint venture type approach to facilitate the ultimate development of the site which could deliver an increment of housing over and above the 10% social housing requirement in the form of key worker housing as outlined above.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is crucial that people who need social housing and key workers who cannot afford high rents can avail of housing in areas like Poolbeg.  MyÂ Department will thereforeÂ continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, housing providers and the local community, in developing and resourcing the mixed-tenure model above and in line with the normal financial safeguards.</p></reply>

The new arrangements (PRSI Class S payable at 4%) apply to all county councillors other than those aged 66 and over and those who are, in conjunction with their membership of a county council, permanent and pensionable civil and public servants recruited before April 1995.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the new arrangements, county councillors had been, since 2011, liable to pay PRSI at Class K (4%) along with other office holders such as members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the judiciary.  PRSI Class K contributions do not provide cover for any social insurance benefit or pension.  I introduced the new arrangements in recognition of the fact that county councillors do not have access to occupational pensions arising from their role as public representatives and that, therefore, it was important that county councillors were covered for social insurance pensions.  County councillors are no longer liable to make a PRSI Class K contribution.</p>  <p>  Social insurance contributors can be awarded a maximum of 52 contributions each year.  Where, for example, someone has two (or more) concurrent employments each of 52 weeks duration in a given year, a maximum of 52 contributions are awarded for access to benefits and pensions.  Similar arrangements apply where an individual is both an employee and self-employed.  As the maximum of 52 Class S contributions are awarded each year for self-employed contributors regardless of the actual number of weeks of  self-employment (subject to a minimum paid contribution of &euro;500) two concurrent occupations both paying Class S contributions do not give rise to additional credits or benefits for the contributor.</p>  <p>  The position, therefore, in respect of county councillors is as follows:</p>  <p>  County councillors who do not have another insurable employment or self-employment now pay Class S and are now covered, as self-employed contributors, for the State Pension (contributory) and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (contributory), Maternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit, Paternity Benefit, Treatment Benefits (from March 2017) and Invalidity pension (from December 2017).</p>  <p>  County councillors who are concurrently engaged in other types of insurable self-employment will be treated in the same way as all other people with multiple self-employments.  A maximum of 52 Class S contributions will be recorded on their social insurance record.  Typical examples are individuals who are engaged in two unrelated self-employments or who have earned and unearned self-employment income or certain company directors who pay Class S (under Schedule E) in their role as directors and Class S (under Schedule D) on income which might or might not be related to their shareholding in a company.</p>  <p>  County councillors who are also engaged in insurable employment or employments, (such employments typically paying Class A) will be treated in the same way as other individuals who are in concurrent insurable employment and insurable self-employment.  52 Class S contributions will be due but this number will be reduced by the number of Class A contributions from insurable employment so that the overall total is no more than 52.  This arrangement is to the benefit of the individuals concerned and reflects the fact that a wider range of benefits are available under Class A.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, I was pleased to announce a number of measures which will benefit the self-employed, including Councillors.  From March 2017 the self-employed have had access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will be extended for both employees and the self-employed from October 2017 providing further dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed, including county councillors.</p>  <p>  I look forward to introducing further improvements for the self-employed in line with our commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

These supports include Community Employment (CE) and JobPath.</p><p>CE provides part-time temporary work in local communities, including opportunities for training and development as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments, including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  These schemes help to break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  I am also conscious of the valuable contribution the schemes are making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland.</p><p>Job Path aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them overcome barriers to employment.</p><p>Jobseekers can only participate in one activation scheme or service at a time.  This is to ensure that the scheme and service providers have sufficient time to work with the participants and also that the best use is made of the available places.  Persons who are engaged with the JobPath programme are ineligible for CE for the duration of their participation on this service, but can be considered for CE following their time with Jobpath.</p><p>The CE scheme referred to by the Deputy has approval for 26 participants with 22 currently employed.  A number of recruitment events are planned by the local Intreo office over the coming weeks which will provide an opportunity to identify potential candidates to fill the vacancies on the scheme.  My Department will continue to provide support in relation to recruitment and the operation of the scheme.  If the scheme wishes to raise issues relating to filling vacancies, officials in their local Intreo office will be happy to assist them.</p><p>Following the recent publication of my Department&rsquo;s report - <i>An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme - </i>nationwide consultations with stakeholders are underway.  CE sponsors are being invited to these engagement sessions, as are local public representatives.  Staff from my office will be in touch this week with an invitation to this event.

Contracts with CE sponsors and my Department are subject to the continuing availability of funding.  The period for which a CE sponsor contracts with the supervisor is a matter between those two parties.  In general, it is important that supervisors contract reflect that the positions are subject to continued funding from the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that, in the past, CE supervisors have benefited from pay increases linked to all phases of Benchmarking, Sustaining Progress (Parts 1 and 2) and Towards 2016 (all 4 phases).  It is also worth noting that CE supervisors experienced no reduction in pay over recent years as a result of other public sector adjustments.</p>  <p>  Given that CE supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector, the State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for such employees even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  It is open to individual CE supervisors to make provision for a pension by way of PRSA which all employers are obliged to facilitate.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum under the auspices and chairmanship of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 carried amendments to both jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis.  These amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by this group, particularly in rural communities where the fire service is almost exclusively staffed by retained personnel.</p>  <p>  This legislation provided that when a retained fire fighter is on call this will not result in a disallowance for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment on grounds of availability.  It also provides that retained fire fighters are exempt from suffering a loss of a day of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for any day of firefighting employment.  Finally, the legislation also provides an exemption for retained fire fighters from having to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the legislation and associated regulations allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the jobseeker schemes given the unique circumstances of the service they provide their communities.</p></reply>

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension transition (SPT) which was available at age 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This change standardised State pension age for all at 66 years. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  </p><p>The cost of the SPT in 2013 (the last full year of its operation) was &euro;137 million.  A detailed estimate was carried out last year by my Department of the net cost of re-introducing the SPT.  This cost was based on the costs involved at the time of the abolition of the SPT and used population projection data for the coming years.  Based on those estimates but adjusting for the costs of the increases in the weekly rates of pensions in 2016 and 2017, these costs have been revised as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Estimated full year cost</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;84 million</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>&euro;84 million</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>&euro;87 million</td></tr></table></p><p>This revised costing do not take account of:</p><p>- The costs of any potential increases in the weekly rates of pensions or payment of a Christmas Bonus over the period;</p><p>- The incidence, if any, of higher labour force participation by 65 year olds in the years in question.</p><p>- The impact of increases in State pension age, scheduled for 2021 and 2028</p><p>Social welfare legislation requires that an Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) be carried out every five years.  Such a Review is currently underway with the Report required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in mid-August next.  The Review will examine the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of the SIF including projecting income and expenditure of the SIF over the period out to 2071.  An important component of this work will be quantifying the impact of the changes in the pension age in 2021 and 2028 based on the most up to date demographic and economic projections.  This information, when available, will assist the Department to estimate (1) the cost of extending entitlement to the SPT to age 66 in 2021 and 2022 and (2) to estimate the cost of SPT in 2021 and 2022 if there was no change in the pension age in 2021 as requested by the Deputy.  It should be noted that both such approaches would involve very significant costs to the SIF.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Reviews and investigations of entitlements are conducted by social welfare staff, social welfare inspectors and inspectors assigned to the Special Investigations Unit and a combination of desk-based assessment of entitlements, direct enquiries with recipients of social welfare payments, site and employer visits and face-to-face interviews are used. </p><p>The value of savings recorded by staff for the year 2016 was &euro;506m.  Savings are calculated when a social welfare claim is reduced in value or terminated following a review or investigation initiated by the Department.  Control savings do not include any element where the customer voluntarily told the Department of changes in their means or circumstances which resulted in a reduction in the rate of payment or termination of the claim.  Departmental error cases are also excluded from the savings figure.</p><p>The basis of the savings calculated is scheme specific.  The nature of the scheme is taken into account - in particular whether it is short-term (e.g. jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or supplementary welfare allowance) or more long-term (e.g. State Pension Contributory/Non-Contributory).

In 2016, some 1.7 million applications for benefit, assistance and access to schemes were received and processed and over 82 million individual payments were made to people across all age groups and to employers.  The scale of its operations and expenditure demand that a robust and integrated range of control and anti-fraud measures are in place.  Measures to prevent and detect fraud and enhance controls across the Department&rsquo;s various schemes are set out in the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy which covers the period 2014 &ndash; 2018. </p><p>In 2016, the Department achieved overall savings of &euro;506m as a result of control and anti-fraud measures.  This reflects nearly 950,000 reviews of individual claims undertaken by the Department last year to determine on-going entitlements. </p><p>The &ldquo;Welfare cheats cheat us all&rdquo; publicity campaign is designed to:</p><p>- Promote discussion on the topic of social welfare fraud and challenge the perceptions of those who see it as a victimless crime;</p><p>- Encourage reporting of suspected/known social welfare fraud.  The &ldquo;direct marketing&rdquo; element of the campaign appeals to the public to report fraud and makes is easier for them to do so.  It also affords an opportunity to increase awareness of the Department&rsquo;s fraud reporting contact numbers and online reporting options;</p><p>- Demonstrate that the Government and Department takes the issue of social welfare fraud very seriously and that it will investigate and prosecute, where this is found to be warranted; and</p><p>- Demonstrate that the Department is very conscious of its obligations, as one of the largest spending Departments in the State, and the importance of protecting the integrity of the social welfare system.  </p><p>The delivery of the campaign will achieve a balance of coverage across all demographics and regions and incorporate print, national and regional radio stations, digital and outdoor advertising.  The national and regional radio, print and outdoor advertising will run for a period of two weeks, with a longer timeframe of 4 to 6 weeks for digital/online advertising.  The cost of the advertising campaign is &euro;165,988 excluding VAT.  It includes all design and advertising costs associated with the campaign (print advertising, national and regional radio advertising, outdoor and online/digital advertising).  No additional costs arise in staff resources, website development or the provision of the telephone reporting facility.</p><p>The Department has set no specific savings targets for this campaign.  An overall savings target of &euro;510 million has been set for 2017 and additional reporting from members of the public will support the Department in achieving this target.  Some 500 reports were received in the first week after I launched the campaign on 18<sup>th</sup>April.  This represents more than double the number of reports received in the same week in 2016 and a 70% increase in the number received in the first week of April this year.  </p></reply>

A concerned member of the public can also write to the Department or telephone with information.</p><p>The highest proportion of reports processed in recent years relate to jobseekers payments, supplementary welfare allowance and one parent family payments highlighting suspicions about suspected cases of working and claiming, co-habitation and non-residency. </p><p>The Department is not able to make use of all the information it receives.  This is often the case where insufficient information is provided to identify a person or the person might not be in receipt of a social welfare payment.

A payment is not suspended or stopped on the basis of the report received &ndash; instead this happens when evidence of wrong-doing has been ascertained by the appropriate scheme area.</p><p>All reports are received on an anonymous and confidential basis.  To preserve the integrity of the public&rsquo;s reporting system, the Department does not track the outcome of the individual allegations of wrongdoing received.

This software is used to ensure that multiple or fraudulent identities can be detected at the point where a person registers for a personal public services number (PPSN) or a PSC.  The software utilises a biometric template of a human face digitised from a photograph.  The system identifies a person by measuring certain structural features of their face and comparing these with other identity records maintained by the Department.  Every new photograph captured by the PSC process is compared with all other photographs on the database.  This ensures that an individual has not already been registered for a PSC using a different identity.  </p>  <p>  Where there is suspicion that a person has attempted to gain a PSC where a Card has already been issued to a person matching the same facial profile, the matter is referred to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) to make further enquiries and to refer the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and prosecution under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, as appropriate.   </p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that as of 25 April 2017, 155 suspected cases of identify fraud have been referred to the SIU and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These cases are at various stages of investigation.  Successful prosecutions have been finalised in court in 21 cases, with 18 people receiving custodial sentences. </p></reply>

The application was forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) for the appeal to be processed and she was advised on the 21st June 2016 that the appeal against the decision had not been allowed. </p>  <p>  A request for a further review of the original decision along with additional information on this child&rsquo;s condition/care needs was received on 10th February 2017.  This has been forwarded to a Medical Assessor for their professional opinion.  Upon receipt of the Medical Assessor&rsquo;s opinion, the case will be further examined by a deciding officer, who will revise the original decision if warranted.

Where a person can be identified and sufficient information is provided to warrant a further examination, the report is referred to the relevant scheme area in the Department, directly to a Social Welfare Inspector, or to the Special Investigations Unit for more serious allegations.  A payment is not suspended or stopped on the basis of the report received but when evidence of wrong-doing has been ascertained by the appropriate scheme area.</p>  <p>  All reports are received on an anonymous and confidential basis.  To preserve the integrity of the public&rsquo;s reporting system, the Department does not track the outcome of the individual allegations of wrongdoing received or any review or investigation.

My Department received 45,280 claims in 2016 and a similar number is expected this year.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently experiencing some delays in processing claims in advance of their maternity leave commencement date.  As claims are processed in leave commencement date order it is not possible to give an accurate timeframe for the processing of individual claims. However, the average time to process a paper claim is 6 weeks.  Processing claims by leave commencement date order ensures that those whose maternity leave is imminent receive priority.  </p>  <p>  While the majority of claims are ready for payment in advance of the customer commencing her leave, regrettably, there are a number of customers that receive their first payment up to 3 weeks after they commence their maternity leave. </p>  <p>  Actions have been taken to ensure that claims are ready for payment in advance of customers commencing their leave. Additional resources are being assigned and staff have been working overtime to ensure as many claims as possible get processed and paid by their commencement date. </p>  <p>  My Department has also recently developed a new online service at MyWelfare.ie. Customers can now apply for online Maternity Benefit using this website (www.MyWelfare.ie). This channel is the fastest and most convenient way to apply for Maternity Benefit and customers can receive a confirmation of their award of benefit, within minutes, where their claim has met with all the conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Availing of this claim option will ensure that the customer receives a prompt decision and timely payment of maternity benefit.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each five-yearly review must be completed within 5 years of the completion of the previous review and a copy of the report is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 6 months of the completion of each Review.</p><p>The first Actuarial Review was completed in 2002 (with an effective date of 2000). The fourth Actuarial Review, as at 31 December 2015, is currently being undertaken by KPMG.  The request for tender was published on the 31<sup>st</sup>of October 2016.  Four tenders were received and after an evaluation of all tenders received, KPMG was appointed to undertake the review.  </p><p>It is expected that the Actuarial Review as at 31 December 2015 will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by mid-August 2017.</p><p>In terms of my Department&rsquo;s requirements for actuarial support, the legal requirement to carry out an Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which arises at 5 yearly intervals, and other issues which arise including those related to pensions, have been satisfactorily met by the appointment of external independent actuaries.  In addition, the Department has access to the dedicated actuarial resources in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with which the Department consults on a regular basis. I therefore do not intend to make a specific appointment within my Department to meet the Department&rsquo;s actuarial needs.</p><p>The creation of a State actuary&rsquo;s office reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas, is, in the first instance, a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act, 2003.The provision of such a dedicated actuarial service would have to be take account the demands for such a service and the necessity to provide funding for such a service.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.1528.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200091#WRFF00400"><p>The Pensions Green Paper consultation process commenced in October 2007 and was completed in May 2008.  It formed the basis of the National Pension Framework published in 2010.  The Framework set out that the State pension age would increase to 66 in 2014, 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  This was a response to increasing life expectancy, which has been well documented both in Ireland and internationally, and the requirement to make the pension system sustainable while ensuring the rate of payment is adequate.  </p><p>More recently, the OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirmed that the reforms that have been introduced, including these increases in pension age, are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given increased life expectancy and the increasing cost of pensions into the future.  Notably, that report commented that &ldquo;<i>financial sustainability is not guaranteed unless pension ages are increased beyond current plans in most OECD countries, including Ireland&rdquo;.  </i></p><p>My Department participates in a number of bodies which examine this issue, notably in the context of the European Union, and I am very aware of developments in this area internationally, where most countries recognise that increasing pension age is an important tool in maintaining the adequacy of state pension systems. </p><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age as announced in the National Pensions Framework.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.  It is estimated that the net savings from this measure amount to over &euro;80 million per annum.  As the State Pension (transition) could only be paid if the recipient had retired, and given such a criterion does not apply to the State pension (contributory), the abolition of that pension removed a significant disincentive to those who did not wish to retire at State pension age.  </p><p>In advance of the abolition of the State pension (transition), in 2012 an Interdepartmental Working and Retirement Group convened to discuss the wide range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers, including enterprise issues and employment and equality law issues.  This was in order to consider cross departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of the pensions system.</p><p>More recently, in January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The forthcoming independent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide further information regarding future pension costs.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It helps them to secure and sustain full-time paid employment.  Participants spend 12 months on JobPath and receive intensive individual support to help them tackle barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports.  If the jobseeker secures employment they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment. </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which provides short-term, work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  It is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and improve the employability and work readiness of participants.

In general, jobseekers cannot participate in two schemes simultaneously.  This restriction applies to T&Uacute;S, JobPath and other schemes.  However, if a person has completed their engagement with the one service and continues to be unemployed, participation on other schemes remains an option that can be considered for that person subject to an assessment by a departmental case officer. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The department has contracts in place with 68 companies for the provision of these services (this includes two contracts with JobPath service providers).  The services being delivered do not create employment in themselves, rather it is the role of the staff of these services to assist and support jobseekers to enter / re-enter employment in the open labour market.  </p><p>The JobPath element of the service has been designed to support long-term unemployed people and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment.  The service model has a number of key features, for example, every participant is provided with a service guarantee - a baseline level of service covering, inter-alia, frequency of engagement, personal progression planning, geographic accessibility and in-employment support.</p><p>In the case of East Galway, to date, 726 people have commenced their engagement period with the service.  These clients were referred to the service from the Intreo Centre in Loughrea, and the Social Welfare Branch Offices in Gort and Tuam.</p><p>It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.

This case has had an extraordinary degree of high-level political engagement, investment in terms of person-hours, consultation with third parties worldwide, and consular visits and trial monitoring.  </p>  <p>  The Government has been doing everything possible to secure his release.  We have supported petitions for him to be returned to Ireland under Egyptian Law 140; we have appealed for him to be released under the Egyptian President&rsquo;s &lsquo;Youth Amnesty&rsquo; Scheme, and we have stressed in all contacts the humanitarian dimensions of the case as grounds under which we believe he should be released.  </p>  <p>  On April 3rd, the Taoiseach once again made direct and personal contact with President el-Sisi to renew the Government&rsquo;s appeal to the Egyptian authorities to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay.  This is the Government&rsquo;s objective, and we are working day-in and day-out to seek to secure that outcome.  Both the Taoiseach and I maintain open lines of communication with our Egyptian counterparts.  </p>  <p>  I have also been doing everything possible to build and maintain international support for this citizen&rsquo;s cause, including through my regular contacts on the case with EU colleagues and counterparts, including High Representative Mogherini who has been very helpful and supportive in this matter.  </p>  <p>  The court case in which this man is accused is now moving forward.  The relatively short adjournment periods between recent hearings and the progress in those hearings in terms of witness testimony are indications of momentum in the trial process, which is to be welcomed after a very difficult and frustrating period of over three years.  My expectation now is that the trial will move towards a conclusion.  It is important that there should be no further delays in the process.  </p>  <p>  President el-Sisi has discretionary powers under the Egyptian constitution and laws which would allow him to order the deportation of Ibrahim to Ireland.  However, he has repeatedly said that he cannot consider using these powers while the case remains before the courts.  President el-Sisi has consistently made clear to the Government that he is anxious to resolve this issue as soon as he can, and that he will be able to intervene in the case once the trial has ended.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government cannot intervene in a case that is before the courts in another jurisdiction.  What we can do, and what we are doing, is working constantly to maintain maximum pressure on the Egyptian Government to ensure that they are in no doubt about our wish to see this trial proceeds now to a conclusion and, once it is concluded, that our citizen is returned to Ireland without delay.  </p>  <p>  We maintains open lines of communication with this citizen&rsquo;s family and have been keeping family members fully informed of all developments and updates received from the Egyptian authorities.  There are regular meeting between the family and senior officials from the Department.  </p>  <p>  I want to assure the House that we will continue to keep the pressure on Egypt until we get this young man home.  </p></reply>

This differentiation is something which I have argued for at EU level and, as reported here to the House on many occasions, the EU has taken a number of important steps in that regard in recent years, including in relation to product labelling and EU research funding.  </p>  <p>  I would be open to considering in principle a proposal that the EU should exclude products from illegal settlements from entering the EU market.

If confirmed, these actions would amount to serious violations of fundamental human rights.  </p>  <p>  In a statement delivered to the Seanad on my behalf by Minister Helen McEntee on 12 April, I joined in the widespread calls for the Russian Government to urgently undertake a full and thorough investigation into these reports and to ensure that any individuals found to have committed crimes be brought to justice.  I also emphasised Russia&rsquo;s international obligations to ensure the safety of all persons who may be at risk of persecution.  This call was reiterated by the Irish Ambassador to the Council of Europe at a meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 19 April. </p>  <p>  The European Union is also pressing the Russian authorities to ensure that the allegations are fully investigated and that those fleeing persecution are given full protection.  The EU High Representative Federica Mogherini raised the matter during a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on 24 April.  HR Mogherini highlighted the serious concerns of the European Union and its Member states over the allegations and urged the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of the gay community in Chechnya are respected, in line with Russia&rsquo;s international human rights commitments.  </p></reply>

To that end, a significant programme of engagements with EU partners began after the referendum and is continuing.  To date, there have been over 400 engagements across government at either political or senior official level.  For my part, since the UK referendum, I have had in excess of 70 meetings or conversations, including with each of my EU counterparts.  In recent weeks I met with the Foreign Ministers from Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Austria and, most recently, met with my Croatian, Estonian, Finnish and Romanian colleagues in the margins of the Informal Meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers on 28 April.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that this extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign has been effective in ensuring understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues.  This is clearly reflected in the negotiation Guidelines adopted by the EU 27 Heads of State and Government last Saturday, as well as in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of notification and the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on Brexit, all of which contain strong a strong acknowledgement of our unique concerns, including in relation to the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, the Taoiseach also got agreement at the European Council last Saturday on a statement in the minutes of the European Council in which the EU explicitly acknowledges that the Good Friday Agreement expressly provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about through peaceful and democratic means; and, in this regard, acknowledges that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  As regards Gibraltar, its status with respect to the UK and the EU is that of a UK overseas territory to which the EU Treaties apply, subject to certain derogations.  Moreover, its constitutional status is disputed.  The situation is therefore completely different to that of Northern Ireland, the constitutional status of which, and how that status might change on the basis of the principle of consent, are set out definitively in the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Guidelines make reference to Gibraltar within the context of the framework for future EU-UK relationship, which itself will be the subject of a separate negotiation and agreement at a later stage.  In all likelihood, that agreement will require ratification by all EU27 Member States, including Ireland.   </p>  <p>  This is entirely distinct and separate from the Irish Government&rsquo;s priority of ensuring that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. </p></reply>

This includes more than seventy post offices in Northern Ireland and more than one thousand post offices in this state.  With the availability of both the online passport renewal service for adults and the An Post Passport Express service, very few applicants in Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.  These appointments must be made online.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the online passport application service which I launched on 30 March will greatly assist in managing current and future passport demand.  The service is for adults who are renewing their existing passport, whether they live in Ireland or overseas and it is available twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  The target turnaround time for applications submitted through the online service is ten working days plus postage.  Since the launch over twelve thousand online applications for passport books and/or passport cards have been received.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of the service will result in reduced turnaround times and fewer demands over time on the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  The service will be extended to all applicants, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.  People who cannot or do not wish to apply online will continue to be able to apply through a service provider with an extensive network of contact points throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  The rationale for the opening of additional Passport Offices, particularly given the range of service options available to applicants, is not clear.  Applications, when received by the Passport Service, are streamlined into categories, such as renewals, new, and renewals of lost/stolen passports.  This enables the Passport Service to allocate resources to applications requiring more checks.  An emergency service is available for citizens that need to travel for medical reasons or due to the bereavement of a close family member.  Any office would in any case need to have the capacity to provide a rapid renewal service to applicants with urgent travel such as that available through the Passport Office in Dublin.  This would require an on-site passport production machine in a specially controlled and secure environment.  The purchase cost of a new passport printing machine alone would be approximately &euro;1.7 million.  This is without security, technical, fit-out, staffing and rental costs.  An outreach office without production facilities could not offer a significantly faster service than the online option and it would duplicate the Passport Express service offered through local Post Offices.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements, both those recently introduced as well as those planned, will allow the Passport Service provide citizen focused services in an efficient and effective manner. </p></reply>

Between 1 January and mid-April, over 290,000 applications were received, representing an increase of 19% over the same period last year. The average processing time for renewal applications submitted through the An Post Passport Express service is 16 working days, one day over the target 15 working day turnaround and this has been notified to An Post.</p><p>First-time applications and those for renewal of lost or stolen passports are subject to longer turnaround times due to the extra verification steps involved (current turnaround time is 24 working days).  My Department keeps An Post apprised of changes to the advised turnaround times for each category of applicant and these are updated weekly on the Passport Service website.  In all cases, applicants are strongly encouraged to allow at least six weeks for the processing of a passport and to submit their application through Passport Express only if they have no immediate travel plans i.e. if they are travelling in three weeks or more.</p><p>This exceptional level of demand is likely be sustained into the summer months and we have worked hard to put a number of measures in place, including additional staffing resources and the use of overtime in order to minimise the impact on turnaround times.  Over 50% of the 230 Temporary Clerical Officers recruited to respond to the seasonal demand have been assigned to the Passport Office in Balbriggan, the reminder are divided between the Passport Office in Cork and in Mount Street, Dublin.

This includes more than seventy post offices in Northern Ireland and more than one thousand post offices in this state.  With the availability of both the online passport renewal service for adults and the An Post Passport Express service, very few applicants in Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.  These appointments must be made online.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the online passport application service which I launched on 30 March will greatly assist in managing current and future passport demand.  The service is for adults who are renewing their existing passport, whether they live in Ireland or overseas and it is available twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  The target turnaround time for applications submitted through the online service is ten working days plus postage.  Since the launch over twelve thousand online applications for passport books and/or passport cards have been received.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the service will result in reduced turnaround times and fewer demands over time on the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  The service will be extended to all applicants, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.  People who cannot or do not wish to apply online will continue to be able to apply through a service provider with an extensive network of contact points throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the opening of additional Passport Offices, particularly given the range of service options available to applicants, is not clear.  Any office would in any case need to have the capacity to provide a rapid renewal service to applicants with urgent travel such as that available through the Passport Office in Dublin.  This would require an on-site passport production machine in a specially controlled and secure environment.  The purchase cost of a new passport printing machine alone would be approximately &euro;1.7 million.  This is without security, technical, fit-out, staffing and rental costs.  An outreach office without production facilities could not offer a significantly faster service than the online option and it would duplicate the Passport Express service offered through local Post Offices.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements, both those recently introduced as well as those planned, will allow the Passport Service provide citizen focused services in an efficient and effective manner.</p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of individuals who are available to participate in election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.</p><p>The election observation roster was established for a five year period following a public call for applications in May 2013.  It is expected that it will operate until May 2018.  Officials will work on the details relating to the criteria and methodology in respect of the call for applications for the new roster.  It is anticipated that these will be finalised before the end of the year and a public call for new applicants will issue shortly thereafter.  Details will be published on the Irish Aid website () and existing roster members and those who have expressed an interest in receiving details about the next roster will also be advised.</p><p>In 2013, following an independent appraisal process, the 200 successful candidates and the 10 members of the reserve panel were advised that membership of the roster was subject to Garda vetting and acceptance of the Irish Aid Code of Conduct.  On foot of the subsequent Garda vetting process of these applicants, all but two individuals on the list were confirmed.</p><p>Officials of the Department are in regular contact with the OSCE and EU election Focal Points and also participate in the European Observation network which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilities the exchange of information on all aspects of election rosters and missions.</p><p>If specific complaints or issues relating to observers are brought to the attention of officials, these would be fully investigated and if found to be proven and significant or in breach of the Code of Conduct signed by roster members, the individual roster member would be removed from the election roster.  Since the formation of the roster, no such complaints have been received.</p><p>Members of the roster who are nominated by the Department to undertake election observation missions do not receive remuneration.  They are paid a daily allowance to cover the cost of food, accommodation and all other out-of-pocket expenses, together with the pre-departure grant of &euro;600 to cover associated expenses.  The Department does not seek tax clearance certification from observers prior to participation in a mission.</p><p>The Department deploys members of the roster and, from time to time, officials who work on the relevant geographic desks, on election observation missions, organised under the auspices of the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).The election observation roster is the only means through which we provide a structure to support Irish election observers.A number of independent NGOs also deploy monitors to observe elections throughout the world and the Department is aware of a number of Irish nationals who have deployed on such missions.  These individuals can avail of consular advice and assistance, but would not be eligible for the supports, including payment of travel and subsistence costs, which are only paid to members of the roster who have succeeded in being selected for the election roster.</p></reply>

These delays were due to a variety of factors affecting the finalisation of the detailed design and tender documentation for the projects and delays in the procurement process.  Underspending in this or other years on the OPW's capital allocation is dealt with normally through the system of deferred surrender or capital carryover which allows underspending in the allocation in one year to be carried forward into the following year.</p><p>I am fully satisfied that the OPW has had and will continue to have sufficient funding available to it to meet its requirements for flood relief in any year.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has committed to spending &euro;430 million on the Capital side of the Flood Risk Management area between 2016-2021 which will mean annual expenditure doubling from current levels to &euro;100 million by the year 2021.</p><p>This increased allocation will allow sufficient funding for the implementation of major projects in the current flood relief capital programme and proposed projects arising from the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Plans, which are soon to be finalised.</p></reply>

This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations will work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed OPW flood defence schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  II members have committed to take into account all information provided by OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.</p>  <p>  The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to II in respect of 12 completed flood defence schemes and showing the design, extent and nature of the protection offered by these works.  A further tranche of data was provided to II in January 2015 covering a further 4 completed flood defence schemes.  Earlier this year my officials shared data in relation to phases 2,3 and 4 of the completed scheme in Waterford City benefitting in excess of 400 properties.</p>  <p>  II estimates that flood cover is included as standard in 98% of household insurance policies throughout the country. II has carried out a number of surveys among its members to ascertain the extent to which flood insurance cover is available in the areas for which OPW has provided data, by early 2015, on completed flood defence schemes.  The results of the most recent survey were provided in December last year; they indicate that 83% of property insurance policies in these areas include cover against flood risk.  Where the defences are permanent in nature the percentage is 90%; where demountable defences are used the percentage is 77%.</p>  <p>  In line with Action No. 270 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, the OPW and the Department of Finance are now engaging with II on a quarterly basis.  The OPW and II have established a sub group to explore the legal, technical and administrative arrangements that may allow for the further sharing of data on flood insurance cover for those 300 areas where the OPW has mapped the flood risk through the CFRAM Programme.  This sub group has held its initial meeting and work is progressing in this area.</p>  <p>  I am happy with the work of the Group thus far and am confident that it will continue to progress the issue of flood insurance.</p></reply>

At all times, public service pensions up to a value of at least &euro;12,000 have been unaffected by PSPR, while a higher exemption threshold of at least &euro;32,500 has applied to pensions awarded to persons who retire from 1 March 2012 onwards.</p>  <p>  PSPR is being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 as follows:</p>  <p>  - On 1 January 2016, increases in the annual pension thresholds for PSPR application were activated.  These exemption threshold increases fully removed PSPR from a significant number of pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continued to be impacted by PSPR received a boost of &euro;400 per year.</p>  <p>  - On 1 January 2017, additional PSPR amelioration, acting principally via further exemption threshold increases, fully removed PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensioners, while at the same time boosting those pensions which remain affected by PSPR by up to &euro;500 per year.</p>  <p>  - On 1 January 2018, the third phase of PSPR amelioration will ensure that all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to &euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will no longer affect such pensions, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases, &euro;780 per year.</p>  <p>  At 2015 year-end, public service pensions with annual values up to &euro;12,000 were exempt from PSPR.  Under the FEMPI 2015 three-stage roll-back, which I have outlined, on 1 January 2016, all pensions up to &euro;18,700 became exempt from PSPR; from 1 January 2017, all pensions below &euro;26,000 are now exempt from PSPR, and from 1 January 2018 all pensions up to &euro;34,132 per year will be exempt from PSPR.  Those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in the majority of cases, benefit by up to &euro;1,680 per year.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  As we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR unwinding towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government.</p></reply>

The OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies are focusing on managing the flood risks from fluvial and coastal sources.  While rural run-off into streams, and into groundwater systems that later emerge into streams, that run through one of the Areas for further Assessment (AFAs), such as Gort, would have been taken into account in the CFRAM Studies, the Studies did not set out to address more local urban storm water drainage issues.</p><p>The core strategy for addressing significant flood risks nationally is the CFRAM Programme.

The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.

The Arts Council is statutorily independent in relation to the performance of its functions in funding of the arts. Full details of all its funding schemes are available on the Council's website at .</p><p>I was pleased to secure significant additional funding for the Arts Council in Budget 2017.This will see an increase of &euro; 5million or 8%, in the Council's allocation.  It will allow the Council to enhance supports to artists and arts organisations.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s Strategy <i>Making Great Art Work</i><i></i>sets out the Council&rsquo;s plans to lead the development of the arts in the decade to 2025.Â  The Strategy prioritises the professional artist as well as public engagement and outlines a range of actions that will be taken to deliver on its vision.</p><p>My Department has been unable to locate the email referred to by the Deputy.  The email could be resent to and my Department will consider it.  If the application for funding to which the Deputy is referring is for a capital grant, I hope to announce a new small capital grants Scheme in the coming weeks which will be geared towards providing grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.  I recently announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for 56 arts and culture centres across the country.  This is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces.  A full list of organisations to benefit from funding under Stream 1 and 2 of the Arts and Cultural Capital Scheme 2016-2018 is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

This scheme will see &euro;20 million in funding being invested in towns and villages across rural Ireland over the next 15 months.  The scheme is targeted at rural towns and villages with populations of less than 10,000 people.  Projects which have clear positive economic impacts on the town/village or which stimulate economic activity between a town/village and its neighbouring townlands will be particularly welcome, as will projects which demonstrate leveraging of, or linkages with, other schemes operated by Government Departments or agencies (e.g. in the areas of heritage, arts, culture, tourism, tidy towns, recreational facilities, re-use of vacant premises, vacant sites, energy efficiency schemes, etc.).   </p>  <p>  The objective of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme is to add value over and above any works which Local Authorities might carry out as part of their regular service. Improved street lighting for a village would not necessarily be excluded from the scheme, but I would expect that any such measure would be part of a wider proposal to support the rejuvenation of the village. </p></reply>

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  Of the sites featuring on the Tentative List, the greater progress so far has been with the Royal Sites serial nomination which includes Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha). Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and my Department is holding ongoing meetings of stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps.  It was agreed that the technical evaluations would be sent for international peer review following which work will need to begin on developing draft management plans for each site, including designation of core and buffer zones in each case.  A further plenary meeting of this group is scheduled for next June. The process will also have to take into account that some sites will be managed by the Office of Public Works, others by local authorities, that two are privately owned and that Eamhain Macha is in Northern Ireland.  The culmination of these steps, which will also have to be adopted with each of the other tentative list nominations, would be the creation of the full nomination documents for each site for submission to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage.  While this adds to the timescale, it avoids a top down approach lacking the engagement necessary with local communities to secure full support for the proposals and for the protection and preservation of the sites into the future. </p></reply>

As I mentioned in those replies, the implementation of the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 </i>is recognised as a key priority in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government </i>in so far as it supports the maintenance and development of the Irish language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht.  Other measures outlined in the Programme include:</p><p>- A focus on job creation in the Gaeltacht through investment in jobs by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta;</p><p>- Encouraging the attendance by children at Irish-medium pre-schools or na&iacute;onra&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas; and,</p><p>- Increasing investment in the Irish language.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department, together with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, administers a wide range of schemes, programmes and initiatives targeting language and economic development in Gaeltacht areas.

This increased allocation will further enable my Department, acting in co-operation with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and relevant stakeholders at community level, to implement a range of specific and practical measures aimed at supporting both the implementation of the Strategy and of the language planning process in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>A further increase of &euro;1m in current funding provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote this year for the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Islands programme area will enable my Department to allocate extra resources to Gaeltacht support schemes such as the Irish Language Summer Colleges and community schemes funded by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p><p>In relation to economicÂ development, as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I very much appreciate the importance of job creation in helping to retain sustainable communities in Gaeltacht areas.  In this context, I wish to acknowledge the very important enterprise and employment function of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as the regional economic development agency for the Gaeltacht.  In its regional enterprise role in the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, will continue to work towards attracting investment to the Gaeltacht, in addition to supporting micro-enterprises and developing the skills base in the Gaeltacht.

Good progress has been made to date in terms of launching Ireland&rsquo;s first <i>Arts in Education Portal</i>, holding National Arts and Education Days and developing Teacher Artist Partnerships through the Education and Training Centres.  Indeed, I look forward to attending the next National Arts Day, this Saturday 6 May, in St Patrick's College DCU, Drumcondra. </p><p>Arising from the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017, I am pleased that the Arts Council decided to increase funding in this area for 2017 from &euro;3.1m in 2016 to &euro;3.7m this year. </p><p>These initiatives demonstrate the overall commitment of Government to deliver for children as we work in finalising the Creative Children plan.</p></reply>

I hosted a productive public forum on Brexit in Monaghan last November which was attended by a range of interests from the Border region. I also hosted a Sectoral Dialogue on Brexit in Cavan on 6 February which was attended by over 100 stakeholders from across the arts, culture, film, heritage, Irish language, regional and rural affairs sectors. This Sectoral Dialogue meeting focused on the impacts of Brexit on the sectors served by my Department, with particular attention being given to the impacts on Rural and Border communities. This event was part of the ongoing engagement with civil society initiated through the series of All-Island Civic Dialogues hosted by the Taoiseach.  The actions set out in Realising our Rural Potential, the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development launched in January, will also assist in supporting rural communities, including those in border areas, to meet the challenges posed by Brexit and to position themselves to avail of the opportunities which also may arise.Â  The Action Plan contains over 270 actions to be delivered by a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies and sets out to support sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural connectivity.Â  </p>  <p>  The plan sets out a number of actions which will address the effects of Brexit in particular. For example, a specific piece of research will be commissioned on the impact of Brexit on rural areas, and particularly rural areas in the Border region. Also, InterTradeIreland will fund the development of a programme of initiatives to increase the awareness and capacity of SMEs to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross border trade.     </p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a number of structural and other arrangements to address issues relating to Brexit. These include a   n inter-Departmental Group that was formed in April 2016. My Department has been   represented on the Inter-Departmental Group since its establishment. In addition, a Working Group, chaired at Assistant Secretary level and composed of officials from across the Department was established within my Department to deal with Brexit issues. This Working Group is supported by the Department's EU Coordination Unit which is also responsible for managing those issues relating to Brexit that fall within my Department&rsquo;s remit. These arrangements are being kept under review and will be enhanced if required in the coming period.</p></reply>

My Department officials continue to work with relevant Departments and other stakeholders to develop this plan with a launch timeframe of early Autumn 2017.

Good progress has been made to date in terms of launching Ireland&rsquo;s first Arts in Education Portal, holding National Arts and Education Days and developing Teacher Artist Partnerships through the Education and Training Centres. Indeed, I look forward to attending the next National Arts Day, this Saturday 6 May, in St Patrick's College DCU, Drumcondra. </p><p>Arising from the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017, I am pleased that the Arts Council decided to increase funding in this area for 2017 from &euro;3.1m in 2016 to &euro;3.7m this year. </p><p>These initiatives demonstrate the overall commitment of Government to deliver for children as we work in finalising the Creative Children plan.</p></reply>

This capital scheme is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. This kind of investment is at the centre of what I am trying to achieve through Creative Ireland and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme was considerably over-subscribed. The Department received 106 applications in total under Stream 1 and 2 seeking total funding of over &euro;20m with eligible requests for funding totalling over &euro;14.6m. The detailed selection criteria and eligibility requirements were published in the Guidelines of the Scheme. There was a two stage assessment process.  The first stage involved all applications being reviewed on receipt to ensure eligibility. All eligible applications were then forwarded to an Assessment Panel which undertook the second stage of the assessment of the applications which advanced from stage one. The Assessment Panel reviewed each eligible application within the defined criteria and scored them accordingly. The recommendations were then forwarded to me for decision as set out in the published scheme conditions. Following these assessment processes, 56 projects are being funded. Seven flagship projects will receive substantial funding allocations while a further 49 projects will receive funding ranging from &euro;20,000 to &euro;276,000.  Full details of these can be found on my Departments website. </p>  <p>  I will be opening a further Stream of funding under this Scheme shortly. It will provide small capital grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit.  While the amounts involved are relatively modest, the grants will in themselves make a huge difference to individual organisations and will be of particular benefit to local cultural centres throughout rural Ireland.   </p></reply>

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.  My Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  Of the sites featuring on the Tentative List, the greater progress so far has been with the Royal Sites serial nomination which includes Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Hill of Uisneach, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex and Navan Fort (Eamhain Macha). Technical evaluations have been produced for each of the six component sites and my Department is engaged in on-going discussions with stakeholders from all six locations to review progress and to chart the next steps. In that context, it has been agreed that the technical evaluations will be sent for international peer review following which work will begin on developing draft management plans for each site, including designation of core and buffer zones in each case. </p>  <p>  As part of the process, the Steering Group representative of stakeholders from each area will be visiting each of the six sites. The next such site visit, and further plenary meeting, is planned for Rathcroghan in June.</p>  <p>  The culmination of these steps, which will also have to be adopted with each of the other tentative list nominations, would be the creation of the full nomination documents for submission to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage. While this adds to the timescale, it avoids a top down approach lacking the engagement necessary with local communities to secure full support for the proposals and for the protection and preservation of the sites into the future. </p></reply>

The Atlantic Economic Corridor proposal aims to contribute to effective regional development by creating sufficient scale along the western part of Ireland to match other regions &ndash; and particularly the East coast - in attracting Irish and multinational investment, growing jobs and supporting vibrant local communities.   </p>  <p>  Towards the end of last year I, along with officials from my Department, held a number of meetings with public bodies and with representatives from the Chambers group to further explore the proposal. </p>  <p>  On foot of these discussions, I established an Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in March and chaired the first meeting of the group in Castlebar.

Our 6 Â National ParksÂ account for circa 60,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares Â ofÂ nature reserves and other heritage sites.  While Â theÂ existing Â National ParksÂ are managed from a conservation perspective, it is also recognised that they are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; which play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism and indeed active walker industry. Â The National ParksÂ and Wildlife Service manages and maintains more than 485km Â ofÂ trails between Â National Parks, Nature Reserves and other conservation /recreational properties. These are dispersed geographically across Â theÂ country and attracted in excess Â of 4 million visitors annually. Within Â the National ParksÂ alone, Â theÂ NPWS is responsible for a trail network spanning some 220km, including both cycling and walking trails, which run over some Â of theÂ most iconic and scenic landscapes in Ireland. In addition, long-distance trails such as Â theÂ Wicklow and Kerry Way, 129km and 122km respectively, run through Â the National ParksÂ and are also maintained by the NPWS.  NPWS sites have 18 trails currently listed on the National Trails Register.   </p>  <p>  Given theÂ resources available for capital investment within our National ParksÂ and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful Â of theÂ need to focus on theÂ core responsibilities relating to the management of theÂ existing Â ParksÂ and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National ParksÂ in theÂ country. However, as part ofÂ my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise Â theÂ sustainable tourism potential Â ofÂ heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated Â theÂ extension Â ofÂ Wicklow Mountains Â National ParkÂ  by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins Â the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to Â the preservation Â ofÂ  our natural heritage for future generations ofÂ citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.   </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership earlier this year with a view to growing tourism revenues in Â theÂ rural areas where Â the parksÂ are located and Â increasingÂ Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination. F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be investing capital funding Â ofÂ &euro;500,000 to kick-start Â theÂ initiative. Â This initial funding will focus on Â theÂ five Â National ParksÂ and five Nature Reserves situated on Â theÂ Wild Atlantic Way in addition to Wicklow Mountains Â National Park. TheÂ funding will facilitate Â theÂ undertaking Â ofÂ feasibility, scoping and design Â of tourism and recreational projects, building on Â theÂ strengths Â ofÂ each location, as well as further promoting track and trails within our Â National ParksÂ and Nature Reserves for walkers and tourists.</p></reply>

The Arts Council is dedicated to supporting a vibrant community of visual artists, visual arts groups and  organisations so that the public can experience the highest standard of visual arts , in urban and in rural parts of Ireland.</p><p>The strategic context for the Arts Council&rsquo;s support all areas of arts practice is set out inMaking Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy (2016 &ndash;2025).  This describes how the Council will lead the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade. The strategy has five priority areas: the artist; public engagement; investment strategy; spatial and demographic planning; and developing capacity.  The Arts Council offers a number of complementary supports so that visual artists can develop their practice and create artistic work. Through its partnership with Culture Irelandand  a number of Cultural Institutions, the Council supports representation of visual artists internationally.  A number of schemes and initiatives have been established by the Arts Council towards the support of visual arts and full details can be accessed on the Arts Council website (). </p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured significant additional funding for the Arts Council of &euro;5m, or 8%. The increase will assist the Council in implementing its 10-year strategy. It also reaffirms the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to progressively increase funding for the arts as the economy improves. </p><p>Artists may benefit under the artists' exemption tax relief (Section 195 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997). The first &euro;50,000 per annum of income earned by writers, composers, visual artists and sculptors from the sale of their work is exempt from income tax in Ireland. </p><p>In December, I announced that my Department in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection would devise a mechanism during 2017 to assist self-employed artists who have applied for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance. I have been in contact with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection on the matter and officials of our two Departments are working on this initiative in consultation with the Arts Council. The scheme will be a pilot scheme and is part of the Creative Ireland Programme launched in December. Details of the pilot scheme will be announced shortly. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.2010.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200102#WRRR00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 763 and 768 together.</p>  <p>  My role, as Minister, with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners as regards heritage assets. </p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of architectural heritage. The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.   </p>  <p>I also have a role, as Minister, in terms of being a prescribed body under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2015, whereby development proposals that may impact on our built heritage are referred by planning authorities to my Department so that recommendations can be made as appropriate to avoid or mitigate any such impacts.   </p>  <p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the maintenance and restoration of major historical or cultural sites on both a rural and regional basis. As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014   of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument. Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW). Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p>  <p>  My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation     and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care most of which are regionally spread. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State. Anyone proposing works to a monumentÂ that isÂ included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.   </p>  <p>  I launched the Built Heritage Investment Scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures on 21 October 2015.Â  This scheme operated in 2016, via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014 and which is being run again this year. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.Â  This fund is being run again in 2017 and seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.Â  </p>  <p>  I am delighted to be able to say that tomorrow I expect to announce a significant investment in both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund for 2017. These will now support a large number of projects across every local authority area in the country.   </p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a state initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 built heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid to its protection and conservation. The NIAH building surveys provide the basis for my recommendations, as Minister for Arts, Heritage Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to the planning authorities for the inclusion of particular structures in their Record of Protected Structures. The published surveys are a source of information on the selected structures for relevant planning authorities both urban and rural. They are also a research and educational resource. </p>  <p>  In view of the broad range of measures in place across the various areas of our built heritage which I have outlined above which involve my Department, Local Government and the OPW, I would consider such investment in our rural and regional sites as central to the objectives set out in the Action Plan for Rural Development.   </p></reply>

In this regard I secured increases in funding across a range of arts and heritage bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit, as well as increases in a number of rural schemes under Budget 2017. These included:</p><p>- An additional &euro;5 million for the Arts Council, an 8% increase in its annual budget;</p><p>- Boosts in funding for all of the National Cultural Institutions;</p><p>- &euro;2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored historic wings at National Gallery of Ireland and the opening of Killarney House on foot of significant capital investment by the State;</p><p>- An increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board and &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- An additional &euro;1 million to assist the Heritage Council with its work;</p><p>- Funding of &euro;5 million for implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme;</p><p>- A trebling in funding for the Town and Village Regeneration Scheme (&euro;12m in total for 2017);</p><p>- An additional &euro;8 million for National Rural Development Schemes, includingÂ  &euro;5 million for the recently re-opened CL&Aacute;R Programme; and</p><p>&euro;40 million for the delivery of the LEADER Rural Development Programme in 2017.</p><p>Much of this investment is being delivered through the recently published Action Plan for Rural Development and Creative Ireland Programme.  For example,  under the 2nd Pillar of the Creative Ireland Programme - Enabling creativity in every community - each local authority is being asked to develop a Culture and Creativity Plan, reflecting the overall structure and aims of the national strategy for culture and creativity. These plans will be key to promoting heritage and arts assets in every community around the country.  To deliver this each local authority has now established a Culture Team bringing together arts officers, librarians, heritage officers, museum curators, archivists and other relevant personnel led by a Director of Services, with a nominated person as 'Creative Ireland Co-ordinator'. </p><p>All these initiatives will assist in bringing jobs to rural Ireland.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, provisions to amend the Canals Act 1986 in order to allow for the subsequent making of bye laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals are contained in the Heritage Bill 2016. The proposed changes would allow Waterways Ireland to proactively manage the Royal and Grand Canals and the Barrow Navigation.

Ireland is a strong advocate of the FCTC and is fully committed to its implementation. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products was adopted in November 2012 and is the first protocol to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The Protocol was signed by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York on 20 December 2013 and it is the intention to ratify the Protocol.</p><p>The objective of the Protocol is to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products. The Protocol requires Parties to take measures to control the supply chain of tobacco products effectively and to cooperate internationally on a wide range of matters.  The FCTC Protocol is a mixed competence agreement.  The effect of this is that has to be ratified both by the Member States of the EU and by the European Union. </p><p>The Protocol sets out a number of obligations including, amongst others, the following:</p><p>- Licensing in respect of the growing, retail, transporting and distribution of tobacco products;</p><p>- Tracking and tracing of tobacco products from manufacture to intended market for retail sale;</p><p>- Sale of tobacco products over the internet;</p><p>- Offences, prosecutions and sanctions in relation to the illicit trade of tobacco;</p><p>- Disposal of confiscated illicit tobacco products;</p><p>- International cooperation i.e. information sharing, enforcement, investigation, prosecutions, mutual legal assistance and extradition; and</p><p>- Reporting.</p><p>In respect of licensing, the<font color="#FF0000"> </font>Government approved the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the introduction of a licensing system and other measures in relation to the sale of tobacco products and non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems, including e-cigarettes. The drafting of a Regulatory Impact Assessment and the General Scheme for the Bill is ongoing.</p><p>The EU Tobacco Products Directive, which Ireland transposed into domestic law last year, contains provisions relating to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products which is a key element of the WHO FCTC Protocol.  Discussions are currently being held at EU level in relation to the development of a legal framework for a track and trace system within Member States.  </p><p>The Department of Health in Ireland will work with key stakeholders, including<i>inter alia</i>the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Finance and the Department of Justice to move towards ratification of the Protocol.  </p></reply>

The Agency plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines and I believe Dublin is the right choice for the new host city.</p><p>In October 2016 the Irish Government agreed that Dublin should be promoted as a suitable new location for the EMA. An interdepartmental/interagency working group, chaired at a senior level by the Department of Health, has been set up to prepare a bid in support of the relocation of the Agency to Dublin. This group has commenced its work with a view to finalising a proposal this year for submission to the European Council in due course.</p><p>The Government believes that Dublin would be a very suitable location for the EMA, particularly in the interests of ensuring continuity and sustainability in the conduct of its business. Such continuity is critical for European citizens and the industries which the EMA regulates. </p><p>Dublin is a safe, modern, open and multicultural city which can offer a range of advantages to the EMA including:</p><blockquote>- Whole-of-government support for the relocation;<br /><br />- Excellent connectivity through Dublin Airport to Europe;<br /><br />- A dynamic life sciences sector;<br /><br />- High quality of life for staff and their families;<br /><br />- Strong education and research credentials; and<br /><br />- All the amenities of a modern capital city.</blockquote><p>The relocation of the EMA also represents an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency to Dublin which will directly employ almost 1,000 staff and attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors.  The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.</p><p>Its location in Dublin would also stimulate employment in ancillary sectors, including the hospitality and transport industries.</p><p>I met with permanent representatives of EU Member States in Brussels last Friday to set out the strength of the Irish bid. I also met the Belgian health Minister to promote Dublin for the EMA. I will officially launch the brochure in Dublin, along with an accompanying website on Thursday 4 May. This will be followed by visits to cities around Europe to promote the Dublin bid. </p><p>The plan is that in each city stop there will be a bilateral meeting between me or Minister of State Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, with our equivalent health minister.  However, the Irish delegation would also include senior representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) as well as the IDA Ireland, to allow us to project the strength of the coalition we have built in Ireland to support Dublin&rsquo;s bid.</p><p>Ultimately the decision on the new location for the EMA will be made by the European Council at heads of state or government level. Therefore I want to ensure in advance of that decision that European leaders are clear that Dublin is the best location for the EMA and is ready, willing and able to host it successfully. </p></reply>

Persons who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis. Details of the numbers of private patients attending particular GPs are not collected by the Department of Health or the HSE.</p><p>The introduction of GP care without fees to children under 6 represents a major step forward in improving access, quality and affordability of health care in Ireland.  The under 6s GP service contract, which includes age-based preventive checks focused on health and well-being and a cycle of care for children with asthma, underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing primary care and keeping people well in their own community.</p><p>To date, approximately 95% of GMS GPs have entered into agreements with the HSE for the provision of services to children under 6 and 364,426 children under 6 have access to GP care without fees through a medical card or GP visit card. This represents approximately 90% of the under 6 population, according to the latest census information available from the CSO for this age cohort.</p><p>Information on the total number of persons who have registered for GP care without fees for under 6s to date is not readily available to my Department.  In any event, it should be noted that this figure would not reflect the total number of children who currently have access to the service, as many children who registered since the scheme was introduced in 2015 would now have turned 6 years old and would no longer be automatically eligible for GP care without fees. There would also be a proportion of children under 6 who hold medical cards or GP visit cards which were awarded based on an assessment of their family&rsquo;s means, many of whom would have held this card prior to the introduction of  the scheme in 2015.</p><p>As of yet, no research has been carried out in relation to why a small percentage of the eligible population have not yet registered for the free GP care for under 6s service. Information on the service is widely available online. However, parents or guardians must register their children to avail of the scheme, and it is up to each parent or guardian to decide if they wish to do so. In some cases, a child may already attend a GP who does not hold a contract with the HSE to provide services to children under 6, and their family may wish for them to continue to attend this GP on a private basis.</p><p>Parents/guardians of eligible children who do not have a Medical Card or GP Visit Card must register them for this new scheme at www.pcrsonline.ie. A printable form is also available on the site or from HSE Local Health Offices if applicants would prefer to submit a paper based form.

I would advise any parent or guardian who is experiencing a difficulty in registering a child for the under 6s service to contact the HSE, who will be able to assign their child to a GP.</p></reply>

The Medical Council collects and analyses data from the general , specialist and trainee specialist registers to produce valuable data on the GP workforce. The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service collects data on the number of GMS contract-holders and those GPs delivering state-funded primary care services.

Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare service of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include:</p><p>- visitors to one member state from another;</p><p>- pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants;</p><p>- dependant families of persons who are employed in another member state; and</p><p>- persons referred for treatment in another member state.</p><p>Ireland and the United Kingdom operate a bilateral healthcare reimbursement arrangement, in respect of health services provided under the Regulations, covering temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the arrangement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis. </p><p>The amount payable in any one year is based on an estimate of the numbers of persons within the categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  An initial payment on account is made for the relevant year and is subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.  Total payments in any one year can as a consequence relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and the payment on account in respect of the current and/or previous years.  </p><p>The net payment received by Ireland from the United Kingdom in 2016 was &euro;277.6m, of which an amount of &euro;97m related to the settlement of final accounts for previous years, and an amount of &euro;180.6m related to the payment on account for 2016.  The relative values of this amount attributable to each country are as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Payable by the UK to Ireland</td><td>&euro;193.1m</td></tr><tr><td>Temporary Visitors (based on an estimate of 15,725,000 visitor days) </td><td>&euro;  12.6m</td></tr><tr><td>Pensioners and their dependants (based on an estimate of almost 35,000 persons)</td><td>&euro;180.5m</td></tr><tr><td>Payable by Ireland to the UK</td><td>&euro;  12.5m</td></tr><tr><td>Temporary Visitors (based on an estimate of 13,272,000 visitor days)</td><td>&euro;    8.1m</td></tr><tr><td>Pensioners and their dependants (based on an estimate of 1,260 persons)</td><td>&euro;    4.4m</td></tr><tr><td>Net paid by UK to Ireland</td><td>&euro;180.6m</td></tr></table></p><p>Entirely separate arrangements apply to patient referrals for scheduled treatment in the other country whereby the costs arising are reimbursed on an actual costs basis.  These arrangements are administered by the Health Service Executive.  In 2016 the HSE issued 867 forms to approved patients who availed of healthcare in the United Kingdom at a cost of &euro;9,169,452.  In relation to UK patients who received healthcare in Ireland, data for 2016 is not yet available, however in 2015 the HSE submitted claims totalling &euro;1,857,764 in respect of 14 approved UK patients who received healthcare in Ireland.</p></reply>

The vision of the programme is to design standardised models of integrated care pathways for the delivery of clinical care to ensure sustained quality clinical operational management.  Overall, the programme aims to improve quality, access and cost-effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland.  </p><p>The programme can point to many improvements in Stroke care since its inception.  The HSE has previously advised my Department that emergency thrombolysis is provided now to patients in all regions of the country by improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. </p><p>There is national 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis, the rate of which has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 13%.  This exceeds the national target of 9%. </p><p>Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced mortality rates, reduced dependency and shorter lengths of stay in hospital by patients.  Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke, nine new stroke units have been opened, bringing the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-two.  This is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2008 which reported one stroke unit in the country.</p><p>The programme has also developed a range of care pathways to assist the streamlining and standardisation of stroke care delivery.</p><p>The cost objectives of the programme have also been met with more stroke patients experiencing improved clinical outcomes. Examples include:</p><p>- Less stroke patients are dying in hospital: The rate has dropped from 16.2% in 2009 to 14.1% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 12.9%;</p><p>- Less stroke patients are discharged to nursing homes &ndash; and therefore with improved disability outcomes: This has reduced from 17.7% in 2009 to 13.8% in 2014 &ndash; an overall percentage reduction of 22.1%;</p><p>- More stroke patients are discharged directly to home from acute hospitals: The rate has increased from 50.7% in 2009 to 51.6% in 2014;</p><p>- The median acute hospital length of stay for stroke has fallen from 10 days in 2009 to 9 days in 2014, with an estimated 19,000 bed days saved in the 2011-2014 period.</p><p>This is all good news for stroke patients. </p><p>As these questions are service matters, they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to each Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Scheme operates under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.  The maximum prices to be paid in public facilities, and referred to as the cost of care, are set by the HSE, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and are published on the HSE website.  The Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living;</p><p>- Laundry service</p><p>The Scheme has a national ring-fenced budget of &euro;940 million in 2017, providing support to just over 23,600 people by the end of the year.  The budget is administered by the NHSS National Office in Tullamore.  In order to manage the available funds within the budget throughout the year, a national placement list is operated by the HSE.  Funding approvals issue to applicants in chronological order.  In 2017 the time applicants to the Scheme spend on the placement list for funding should not exceed 4 weeks.</p></reply>

Consequently, the efficient management of parking spaces and traffic flow on hospital campuses is of crucial importance.  This is to ensure on-going availability of parking spaces; free flow of traffic on campus; unobstructed access for emergency vehicles at all times; proper use of spaces designated for drivers with disabled permits; and proper use of spaces designated as drop off points near the hospital entrance.</p>  <p>   The HSE (Health Service Executive) has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals.  Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. </p>  <p>  Arrangements for car parking generally is an operational matter for the HSE.  The HSE has advised that it does not provide guidelines on hospital parking and each hospital/hospital group implements their own guidelines. </p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses.  Consequently, a maximum daily fixed parking charge has been introduced, thus capping this expense.  I understand that some hospitals also provide reduced rate parking rates for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised me that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.</p></reply>

In this regard the PAC, in its most recent correspondence on this matter with the HSE on 16 February 2016, has affirmed that &ldquo;<i>Whilst the Committee wanted to find a resolution to this issue, it has always accepted that this was a matter for the HSE</i>.&rdquo;  The Committee has also acknowledged that it was satisfied that it was dealing with a matter of administration and that no findings of fact that would breach the legal principles set down in McGuire v Ardagh [2002], were made. </p><p>My officials have discussed this matter with the HSE.  The very clear view of the HSE is that the Executive has adhered entirely with the terms and conditions of the lease, and that, given its obligations under the Health Act 2004 (which requires that the HSE uses its resources efficiently and economically to deliver public health services), the HSE does not consider it appropriate to renegotiate the lease agreement.  </p><p>Additionally, the Association was advised by my Secretary General that there were not sufficient grounds to intervene in what was essentially an operational matter which is the responsibility of the HSE under legislation.  The HSE is complying with its commercial obligations, and is precluded from offering improved terms to the Association simply to improve its financial resources.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the matter will be further examined and may be considered in the context of budgetary planning.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively; in that regard, it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway.  I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. </p></reply>

Enforcement activity is recorded by enforcement cases opened and product detained. </p><p>The HPRA does not record the cost of specific enforcement activities.  It prioritises enforcement cases on the basis of the perceived risk to public health; application of an average cost would not be representative as visits vary considerably according to the issue being investigated, the time spent on the premises, the number of personnel involved and the depth of investigation required at the particular time. </p><p>Section 32 (b) of the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 and 2006 provides powers for the enforcement officers at HPRA.

However, it should be noted that authorised officers of the HPRA do not have powers to arrest or detain people.</p><p>HPRA enforcement activity is recorded by enforcement cases.

It builds on existing tobacco control policies and legislation already in place in this country, and sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.  Tobacco Free Ireland was among the first policy documents to be launched under the Healthy Ireland framework and will play a major part in achieving the vision set out in Healthy Ireland.  The two key themes underpinning Tobacco Free Ireland are the protection of children and the denormalisation of smoking.</p>  <p>  A high level action plan for Tobacco Free Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations was published in March 2015 and Annual Reports monitoring progress are also published and are available on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to implementing Tobacco Free Ireland as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  Considerable progress has been made and the action plan is being implemented as published. </p>  <p>  The Tax Strategy Group which is an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Finance, considers papers on various options for the Budget and for the medium and longer term.  In its deliberations on taxation of tobacco products it has considered Tobacco Free Ireland&rsquo;s recommendation for the introduction of a levy on the tobacco industry, representations from Non-Governmental Organisations in the health sector  and the experience of other countries in this arena.  To date the focus has been on the price of tobacco products at the retail level as price is considered to be an extremely important factor in influencing decisions around smoking. Excise duties have increased in 21 of the last 25 budgets and have had a positive impact of public health and revenue generated.</p>  <p>  I will continue to press for further increases on tobacco products in subsequent budgets.  The issue of a tobacco industry levy will be kept under consideration.</p></reply>

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland. While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  </p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.</p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issues raised by the Deputy I do not intend to contact the manufacturers and there are no plans to hold an enquiry.</p></reply>

It is however essential that the medicines in question are safe and that appropriate prescribing guidelines are followed by the health professional treating the child.</p>  <p>  Before a medicine is made available to the public, it undergoes an authorisation process whereby the medicine&rsquo;s safety, quality and efficacy is assessed, based on the results of clinical trials.  All medicines have side effects so it is only when the risk benefit analysis is positive, i.e. that the potential benefits to the patient outweigh the potential risks that the medicine receives an authorisation.    </p>  <p>  Once available a medicine is then subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation through a process of pharmacocovigilance which operates at EU wide level to monitor the use of medicines in large numbers of patients and manage and analyse information on suspected adverse reactions to medicines.</p>  <p>  European reviews of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants and opioids have resulted in updates to product information in order to support better informed prescribing and use of these medicines in various patient groups including children. Important safety updates are communicated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to health professionals via their Drug Safety Newsletter.  The HPRA, in conjunction with its European counterparts continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and take appropriate regulatory action when necessary. </p>  <p>  In Ireland there are a number of sources of prescribing guidelines. More recent guidelines include a Consensus Statement issued by the College of Psychiatry on the use of benzodiazepines in specialist mental health services (2012), Guidance issued by the Irish College of General Practitioners on Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Diagnosis and Management (2013), and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016.  Section 42 of the Medical Council Guide states for example that doctors should keep up to date with developments in medication safety and seek independent, evidence-based sources of information on the benefits and risk of the medicine.  It also states that doctors should be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential and should take reasonable steps to make sure they are not inappropriately obtaining drugs from multiple sources. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has also been actively involved in ensuring appropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs.  Reports are sent to GPs on a regular basis setting out the number of benzodiazepine and &lsquo;z&rsquo; drug prescriptions dispensed to their patients and these reports allow GPs to compare their prescribing patterns to that of their peers.  The reports also highlight where patients are on these medications for longer than the recommended period.  </p>  <p>In terms of research data, the Drug Use in Ireland and Northern Ireland Drugs Prevalence Survey 2014/2015, commissioned by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) in Ireland and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland contains data on prevalence rates for sedatives/tranquillisers and anti-depressants.  For young adults aged 15 to 34 and over lifetime prevalence (ever used) for sedatives/tranquillisers was 8.9% (down from 10.1%, the prevalence rate reported in the last survey in 2010/2011).  The lifetime prevalence of anti-depressant use for the same age group was 8.3% (an increase from 6.8%, the prevalence rate reported in 2010/2011). </p>  <p>  The Prevalence Study do not provide information on the number of children prescribed sedatives/tranquillisers and anti-depressants.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has some limited data on prescribing tends for children on the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme pharmacy claims database.  A 2015 research study on benzodiazepine prescribing in children carried out an analysis of GMS data over a 9 year period (2002 -2011).  The study found that prescription rates decreased slightly during the 9 year period and that prescription rates follow a similar pattern to those in other European countries.  However the data is limited insofar as it only relates to medicines reimbursed under the GMS schemes and does not include prescriptions paid for by patients privately.</p></reply>

It involves moving away from inefficient block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the volume and quality of care provided, subject to a budgetary limit.  Each Hospital in the Programme is allocated an ABF budget and a set of activity targets.  These can be altered by the Hospital Group subject to agreement with the Acute Hospitals and Finance Divisions within the HSE.  A system of transition payments is in place to assist the less efficient hospitals to adjust.  These payments will be phased out over time.  The ABF system is currently applied to in-patient and day case services with other services still being funded through the block grant system.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while the new funding model is encouraging hospitals to use resources at their disposal more efficiently, it does not seek to reduce overall expenditure in the acute hospital system.  Instead it provides a more transparent funding mechanism and it more fairly rewards hospitals for the activity that they undertake.  </p>  <p>  In relation to your specific queries regarding University Hospital Kerry, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

Consideration continues to be given to longer-term measures to meet the future requirements of the service and staffing at consultant and other levels will be among the issues to be considered.</p>  <p>  I recently met with cancer support groups from the area and I can confirm that the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), my Department and the Saolta Group are actively engaged in ensuring that a quality breast cancer service will be available in Letterkenny.   </p>  <p>  A radiologist post for Letterkenny University Hospital has been advertised, but attempts to fill this position have proved challenging.  Radiography numbers in Letterkenny have increased, and the hospital will continue to develop its radiography service to meet the needs of patients.  The possibility of further cooperation with health services in Northern Ireland is also being explored, with the hope of building on the level of co-operation achieved in relation to the North West Cancer Centre at Altnagelvin Hospital.  This centre opened in November last year and it is providing access to radiotherapy services to people from both jurisdictions in the North West.</p></reply>

It is estimated that 840,000 of the Irish population aged 15 and over are addicted to tobacco.  Approximately 6,000 Irish people die every year from tobacco related illnesses.</p><p><i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, the report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group, was endorsed by Government, and published in October 2013.  It builds on existing tobacco control policies and legislation already in place in this country, and sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025. <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>was among the first policy documents to be launched under the Healthy Ireland Framework and will play a major part in achieving the vision set out in Healthy Ireland.  The two key themes underpinning <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>are the protection of children and the denormalisation of smoking.</p><p>A high level action plan for <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>was published in March 2015 and Annual Reports monitoring progress are also published and are available on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website.  The Government is committed to implementing <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>as outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government. </p><p>Considerable progress has been made and the action plan is being implemented as published.  Some of the key achievements since the publication of <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>are:</p><p>- the increase in price of tobacco products in Budgets 2014, 2015 and 2016;</p><p>- the commencement of legislation which protects children from second hand smoke in cars;</p><p>- the commencement of legislation to provide for standardised packaging of tobacco products;</p><p>- the commencement of legislation to transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive;</p><p>- the commissioning and publication of the economic cost of smoking in Ireland report;</p><p>- the publication of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s  Health Technology Assessment of smoking cessation interventions;</p><p>- the further development by the HSE of the QUIT campaign and the enhancement of supports for smokers who wish to stop smoking;</p><p>- the commencement of a process to develop National Clinical Guidelines for smoking cessation between the HSE, the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC)  and other stakeholders;</p><p>- the publication of research on tobacco including the potential impacts of standardised packaging;</p><p>- the continued enforcement of tobacco control legislation by the HSE;</p><p>- the continuation of an annual Healthy Ireland Survey, the Health Behaviour in School Children Study (HBSC) and the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) which gives up-to-date reliable data on the prevalence of smoking throughout the whole population;</p><p>- the engagement in the Healthy Ireland Framework to assist with changing social norms around smoking;</p><p>- the involvement of the NGO sector in supporting <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>actions;</p><p>- the approval of Government to proceed with drafting the General Scheme of a Bill to provide for the introduction of a licensing system and other measure for tobacco products and non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems , including electronic cigarettes; and</p><p>- the engagement with the World Health Organisation in implementing the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</p><p>These actions together with other past initiatives have resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of smoking in Ireland.  The Government and my Department in conjunction with the Health Service Executive and other key stakeholders will continue to support as appropriate the further implementation of Tobacco Free Ireland in order to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5% by 2025.</p></reply>

In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine, used during the H1N1 2009 pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year. On 23 September 2010, the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the EMA concluded in its initial review of available data that the available evidence did not confirm a link but that more research was needed. </p>  <p>  By the end of March 2011 the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), now the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) had received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines.  The Department of Health and the HSE agreed that the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre would work with the IMB and Irish clinical experts in narcolepsy to examine the Irish data and report back the findings.  The Final Report of National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19 April 2012.  It found a 13-fold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals and the absolute increased risk associated with the vaccine was five narcolepsy cases per 100,000 vaccinated children and adolescents.</p>  <p>  The vaccination programme in Ireland was based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.  A number of "at risk" groups were defined and prioritised for vaccination commencing in October 2009.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded, giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  The vaccine uptakes among the priority groups were 50% for those medically at risk, 32% for pregnant women (it was 45% during early part of programme), 31% for health care workers, 60% for children aged 6 months to 4 years, 39%  for children aged 5-14 years and 25% for those aged 65 years and older.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010. However, following a full assessment of the situation at that time the vaccine continued to be made available free of charge to the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups through General Practice and Maternity Units until September 2010.</p>  <p>  Since the 2010/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland. Pandemrix was distributed to GPs in January 2011 with a recommendation that it be used for those in at risk groups for a three week period when there was a temporary shortage of seasonal influenza vaccine.  All sites were asked to return any unused vaccine and it has not been recommended for use since then. </p></reply>

The HPRA highlights the fact that all medicines have some risks and a small number of people may develop side effects (also known as adverse reactions).  The clinician treating the patient balances the risks associated with a medicine in the context of the overall benefit of the medicine to the health of the patient and the condition being treated. </p>  <p>  Virtually all chemotherapeutic agents have the potential to initiate infusion or allergic reactions.  Premedication can help to prevent and/or reduce the severity of infusion reactions, particularly infusion reactions.  Generally, testing patients for allergy prior to receiving a chemotherapy is of limited value because the positive and negative predictive values are not known.  Therefore, not all patients with positive results to these tests will develop reactions.  Patients must be monitored closely both during and immediately after all chemotherapy infusions.  Additional risk minimisation measures have been introduced to diminish the incidence and severity of infusion reactions (for example, prolonging the drug infusion, premedication, and antihistamines and glucocorticoids), and these measures have reduced the rate of severe reactions.</p>  <p>  The packaging of all medicines placed on the market must include a Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) leaflet, which sets out detailed product information intended for healthcare professionals.  This information is regularly updated as new data becomes available through various sources of post-marketing experience, including further studies, literature reviews, and evaluation of adverse reaction data.  Section 4.2 of the Taxol SmPC provides detailed information on the premedication schedules and method and durations of administration which should be followed.  It is advised in the SmPC that this chemotherapy should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and that appropriate supportive equipment should be available as hypersensitivity reactions are known to occur.  The National Cancer Control Programme's published protocol on paclitaxel as monotherapy for breast and ovarian cancer states that facilities to treat anaphylaxis must be present when the drug is administered. </p>  <p>  All medicines are also supplied with a packaging leaflet intended for the information of the patient/consumer.  Product labels and package leaflets play an essential part in the safe and effective use of the medicine by both patient and healthcare professionals.</p>  <p>  The HPRA, in conjunction with European counterparts, continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and takes appropriate regulatory action when necessary.</p></reply>

Applications are assessed under Directive 2005/36/EC which applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than the one in which the qualification was obtained.  </p><p>In the case of the health and social care professions falling under the remit of CORU, the Directive provides for an assessment on a case-by-case basis of the qualifications/professional training/post-qualification professional experience of an applicant against the qualifications required to practise in the host Member State (i.e. Ireland).  Due to the case-by-case nature of the assessment and the need to examine an applicant&rsquo;s individual professional experience, it is a time-consuming and administratively burdensome process.</p><p>Regulation 89 of S.I. No. 8 of 2017 which transposes the Directive into Irish law, provides for the charging of fees by a competent authority <font color="#212100">for the application process once, interalia, such fees do not exceed the</font>real cost of the service provided.  As each Registration Board at CORU has been designated competent authority for its profession under S.I. No. 8 of 2017, it is a matter for CORU to set its own fee for qualification recognition having regard to Regulation 89.  I am advised by CORU that the fee, which is in line with that charged by other competent authorities, has been set at &euro;410 since the opening of its first register - the register for Social Workers - on 31 May 2011.</p><p>The detailed assessment process provided for under the Directive necessitates the submission of documents verifying the applicant&rsquo;s identity, formal training, qualifications awarded, eligibility to practise and post-qualification professional experience.  As these are important documents, CORU does not accept originals; it asks applicants to provide photocopies which have been certified by a solicitor/lawyer to be true copies of the originals.  The submission of certified copies of documents is provided for in the Directive.  While it is appreciated that this imposes additional costs on applicants, CORU must be confident that decisions on applications are based on appropriately certified documentation.  </p></reply>

In 2013, the Government approved and published a strategy for developing eHealth capability in the Irish health system called the <i>eHealth strategy for Ireland, 2013. </i>This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth for the benefit of patients.  One of the recommendations in the strategy was the development of a system of unique identifiers for patients to underpin patient safety and efficiency.</p><p>The Health Identifiers Act 2014 gives the legal basis for the development and the deployment of health identifiers that will cover individual patients, and health care providers and professionals in the health service.  The development and implementation of a system of unique patient identification for our health service is a major task and was recommended by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in 2008.  Each patient will be assigned a unique identifier when they engage with the health system for the purposes of better patient care and safety both of which are of paramount importance.  A privacy impact assessment (PIA) has been conducted and a public consultation exercise undertaken as part of the preparation for the implementation.  There has also been engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the deployment.  It should be noted that the Individual Health Identifier is only a number and is, of itself, not a medical record.  Therefore the opt out from the number itself is not feasible and should not be confused with a patients right regarding the use of their medical information. Â In that regard, it is important to bear in mind that the Health Identifiers Act 2014 did not change in any way the law, including data protection law, in relation to the statutory rights of patients regarding their medical records or the obligations that data controllers have for patients' personal health data.Â  Furthermore, patients are entitled to discuss with their health care provider what happens with their health data. Â It is important to point out that the roll out of a system of health identifiers for patients, has no linkage with any eligibility for any type of health service or benefit.  It is primarily a patient safety initiative and a fundamental building block for eHealth and ICT developments into the future. </p><p>The delivery of digital health care services and the roll out of an electronic health record (EHR) will need to be underpinned by a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU general data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  The new EU regulations (General Data Protection Regulation) will, from May 2018, regulate the collecting, use, keeping and disclosing of personal data, including theÂ purposes for which it is collected and used. Â The GDPR provides a timely opportunity to examine how public confidence in the way the health system handles personal health data can be enhanced and that will involve consideration of a range of matters, including consent and the related idea of opt-out.</p><p>Accordingly, my Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support patient safety and allow for digital deployment of information systems into the future.  The health care delivery system requires a robust information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time. Â The confidentiality of health data and the right of citizens to privacy must always be respected while at the same time be balanced against the health needs of the individual and the use of health data for the greater good of society. Â These are complex and demanding issues which must be addressed in the context of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, national and health sector implementation of the new General Data Protection Regulation and existing health legislation including the Health Identifiers Act 2014.</p></reply>

This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care. </p>  <p>  A significant focus of the Winter Initiative was on reducing delayed discharges in acute hospitals through the funding and provision of additional homecare packages, home help hours and transitional care beds.  Delayed discharges reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December and were maintained below 500 from mid-December through to end February.  This had a positive impact on ED overcrowding and trolley numbers, in freeing up beds for use by patients awaiting admission to hospital. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE  fully recognise the importance of recruiting and retaining nurses within the public health system to deliver services.  There is now a commitment to increase the nursing and midwifery workforce in 2017 with 1,208 additional permanent posts, along with 130 additional undergraduate places available in 2017.  There will also be the offer of full-time contracts to all graduating nurses.  Furthermore, commitments have also been made in relation to the provision of  maternity leave cover and  a career break scheme, along with improved educational opportunities and career pathways. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that there continues to be a very strong focus on reducing ED overcrowding.  My Department and the HSE are currently engaged in a process to commence winter planning for next year and to achieve an improvement trajectory in ED performance.</p></reply>

The terms of the agreement, which has now been published,</font>provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>&quot;The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;.  </i></p><p>The new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  <font color="#2F2F2F">This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and will be copperfastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  These reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the Directors and with the approval of the Minister for Health.  The Board of the new NMH will comprise nine directors; four nominated by SVHG, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Two of the NMH Directors will also sit on the SVHG Board. </font></p><p>The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the NMH at Elm Park without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of SVHG that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">I should also acknowledge that the SVHG is making valuable land available, at no cost to the State, to facilitate the new NMH.  In doing so, they have foregone the opportunity to put this land to alternative use. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">As set out in the agreement, the establishment of the new company will necessitate an amendment of the NMH Charter; however as we are still in the very early stages, my Department has not yet been in communication with the NMH in relation to this issue.</font></p><p>Now that the planning application for the development has been submitted we must now turn our focus to the legal mechanisms necessary to operationalise the agreement.  The hospital will be publicly funded, built on lands in the ownership of the SVHG and operated by the new company.  Over the next few weeks I will meet with both hospitals and will consider further the legal mechanisms necessary to absolutely protect the State's considerable investment in the hospital, including the issue of ownership of the new facility.  Prior to the HSE entering into any construction contract, I will formally sanction the necessary arrangements to ensure that the facilities are legally secured on an on-going basis for the delivery of publicly funded maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services commitments.  I should add that over the years we have made very significant capital investment in voluntary hospitals, and no issues have ever arisen in relation to same.  I therefore do not foresee any difficulty in this regard. </p><p>I intend to report to Government on this project at the end of May. At that stage I expect to have further details on the legal and other arrangements envisaged and will make this information available publicly.  This will allow for the necessary clarity well in advance of contractual or other commitments being entered into in respect of this project.</p><p>Finally, I would like reaffirm my commitment to this hugely important project. The facilities at Holles St are no longer fit for purpose.  It is also acknowledged that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders to deliver the new National Maternity Hospital which is so badly needed to provide women and infants with modern healthcare facilities.</p></reply>

As a regulator HIQA has no formal legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority welcomes information about designated centres for dependent persons.  If there is a serious risk to the health and welfare of persons accessing the service, HIQA may decide to take appropriate action.</p><p>While HIQA does not comment on individual concerns I can advise the Deputy that all persons who contact HIQA with a concern are advised to contact the service provider in the first instance. The provider is required under the Health Act 2007 to have a clear complaints procedure in place. Concerns can also be addressed to the HSE's Your Service Your Say, the HSE National Information Line, the Office of the Ombudsman or a HSE Safeguarding and Protection Team, as appropriate.

The HSE Integrated Audiology Programme set up a working group of key stakeholders in 2015, with the aim of assessing the standards that were applied to the fitting of medical devices (i.e. hearing aids) within Ireland. The group has drawn on various good practices that are applied across Audiology and Hearing Aid Audiology and are currently in the final stages of producing a best practice guide to ensure a code of practice for the profession (both public and private) for use within Ireland.</p>  <p>  The sale of medical devices, including hearing aids, within the European Union is regulated by EU legislation. All medical devices placed on the market undergo a conformity assessment to confirm that they meet specified safety and performance requirements.  Once a medical device is CE marked and is not subject to prescription control it may be sold on the EU market without restriction.There are new distributor requirements that will come into effect with the application of the new EU medical devices regulations which will broaden the scope of the current regulatory framework to address obligations of all economic operators.</p>  <p>  The profession of audiologist is not included in the 14 professions currently designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides that the Minister for Health may, following a consultation process and with the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, make regulations designating a health or social care profession not already designated if the Minister considers it in the public interest to do so and if certain specified criteria have been met.</p>  <p>  My Department is proposing, towards the end of this year or early next year, when all registration boards have been established, to ask  CORU - the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to undertake a risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation under the Act and to make recommendations concerning options for their possible future regulation. The question of designating the professions of audiologist will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

The management of ME does not relate to one specific medical specialty but may involve a number of specialties depending on the symptoms of individuals with the condition.

In general, further development of services on the site are planned, and the development control plan is currently being updated. Planning permission has been obtained for a Day Services/Endoscopy Unit as Phase 1 of the Hospital&rsquo;s development plan. A proposal for a temporary unit housing two Theatres and a Day Unit is to be resubmitted for consideration by HSE at corporate level. </p>  <p>  Other services planned on the site include, the replacement of existing long stay elderly care residential units, the building of a Hospice Unit, the development of Intensive Care Rehabilitation Unit, Mental Health Services.

Residents make a contribution  towards the cost of their care based on their means and the State pays the balance. In order to avail of support under the scheme a person must be assessed as needing long term residential care. However, Government policy is to support older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home care scheme is best for Ireland, in relation to both regulation and funding. </p>  <p>  As an initial step in this process, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries. This review was published on 11 April.  </p>  <p>  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Another important step in this process is a public consultation process which I will be launching at the end of May. The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.</p></reply>

The terms of the agreement, which has now been published,</font>provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>&quot;The National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC (limited by shares)&rdquo;.  </i></p><p>The new company will have clinical and operational, as well financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  This independence will be assured by the reserved powers which are set out in the agreement and will be copperfastened by the golden share which will be held by the Minister for Health of the day.  These reserved powers can only be amended with the unanimous written approval of the Directors and with the approval of the Minister for Health.  The Board of the new NMH will comprise nine directors; four nominated by SVHG, four by NMH, including the Master, and one will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Two of the NMH Directors will also sit on the SVHG Board. </font></p><p>The agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the NMH at Elm Park without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  In that regard, I welcome the confirmation by the Board of SVHG that any medical procedure, which is in accordance with the laws of this State, will be carried out at the new hospital.  In conclusion, I can confirm that the change in location of the NMH will not impact on the type of services provided.</p></reply>

Separately, the Government, as part of Budget 2017, approved an increase to the National Minimum Wage with effect from 1 January 2017.  This decision, therefore, provided for an increase to the hourly rate paid to those individuals who undertake sleepovers. </p>  <p>  Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE has in place Service Level Agreements with voluntary providers which set out the level of service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation.  Any individuals employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees and therefore, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff, including rates of pay for undertaking sleepovers.  Accordingly, such arrangements offered by each service provider may vary.</p></reply>

At this meeting the group highlighted a number of issues which I followed up with the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC).  I have reverted to the Minister of State for Gaeltacht Affairs and Natural Resources, who facilitated the meeting, with the information provided to me by both the NAS and PHECC.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Capacity Review, published last year, identifies particular difficulties serving rural areas as population density in Ireland is significantly different to that of many other countries.  The Review indicated that the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary Community First Responder (CFR) schemes.  The further developments of a comprehensive national programme of CFR schemes has therefore been prioritised in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  The NAS continues to work with local CFR Groups across the country, and in Connemara, in an effort to enhance services and greatly values their continued commitment and support.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government and the NAS are fully committed to the provision of a safe, patient focused pre-hospital emergency care service.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to additional annual investment in terms of ambulance personnel and vehicles.  In this regard, &euro;7.2m additional funding was provided to the NAS in 2016, and in 2017, an additional &euro;3.6m has been provided, including &euro;1m to fund new developments.</p></reply>

Service Providers include registered charities, religious bodies, voluntary agencies and non-statutory agencies.  These services would include a number which are provided by religious congregations. </p>  <p>  The HSE has a Governance Framework in place which incorporates national standardised documentation, and guidance documents, that enables the HSE to contractually underpin the grant-funding provided to all Non-Statutory Service Providers.  This Framework seeks to ensure the standard and consistent application of good governance principles, which are robust and effective, to ensure that both the HSE and the Providers meet their respective obligations.  It is reviewed and updated as required.  The HSE aims to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to effectively manage the services and funding, and the Governance Framework provides for national standard governance documentation and administrative processes, which seek, in turn, to ensure both the HSE and the recipient organisations comply with their respective obligations, and that the services delivered provide best outcomes for the service user and represent effective use of public Exchequer funding.

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I understand that in recent times, some GPs are charging GMS patients for these services.</p>  <p>  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review.

This committee has been mandated to develop an integrated public health approach to substance misuse, which is defined as the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illegal drugs.  It is envisaged that the new Strategy will be based on a health-led approach to the drug problem and build on progress achieved under previous drug strategies. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Steering Committee is continuing with its deliberations with a view to presenting its final report to me shortly.

The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination and the scientific evidence is clear that benefits of vaccines outweigh the known side effects</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  While no medicine is entirely without risk, the safety of vaccines, as with all medicines, is carefully monitored and any new evidence concerning side-effects is taken into account.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  </p>  <p>  Unfounded, false claims have been made of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that they first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and a false connection is being made between the HPV vaccine and the onset of these symptoms.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long term illness.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  This means that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.</p>  <p>  Misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  Any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination should talk to their family doctor, or alternatively to visit the National Immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear and accurate and will answer any queries you may have about the benefits or risks of vaccination.  Vaccination is the best way for parents to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue referred to by the Deputy it concerns a complaint made by the Nordic Cochrane Centre concerning the EMA.  The EMA is a decentralised agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any complaint made by a third party concerning an EU agency. </p></reply>

Persons with disabilities, including deaf-blindness, can access a broad range of acute, primary and community based health services, as well as specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory and non-statutory groups.</p>  <p>  Funding for The Anne Sullivan Foundation for Deaf-Blind is provided by the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act, 2004. The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division Operational Plan indicates that &euro;2.56 million has been assigned to the Foundation in 2017 for the provision of supports to people who are deaf-blind.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health does not classify specific medical illnesses or conditions as a disability. There are a number of definitions of disability that are used for particular purposes e.g. the Disability Act, Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, Equal Status Act, Employment Equality Acts and qualifying criteria for income supports such as Domiciliary Care Allowance and Disability Allowance etc. These definitions describe disability in terms of an individual's functional ability in their environment, rather than a medical diagnosis or a named condition.</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy, which is led by the Department of Justice, sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to, and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has the lead responsibility for the Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Deaf-blindness is not currently listed as a separate condition on the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD). However, syndromes related to a combination of deafness and blindness could be included in the future.</p>  <p>  In January 2015 the HSE published new guidelines giving practical guidelines to all health and social care staff on how they can provide accessible services to patients and clients with a disability. The guidelines were developed by the HSE in partnership with the National Disability Authority. Access to services, as covered in the guidelines, is wide-ranging and relates to all aspects of access including accessible information.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions also relate to service matters, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Progress is being made in a number of areas.</p><p>Stage one of the review of mental health policy has been concluded and the Expert Evidence Review report produced will help to determine the policy direction for a revision of <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  I will be appointing an Oversight Group shortly to oversee the next stage of this work.</p><p>The National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health has been meeting monthly over the last year.  As part of my commitment to ensuring that the voices of children and young people are at the heart of the work of the Taskforce, a series of consultations with young people are taking place.</p><p>A key commitment in the Programme relates to the provision of 24/7 mental health services.  I am presently considering HSE proposals for an implementation plan for the provision of a 7-day service response across all HSE mental health service areas.  This should be produced in the coming weeks.</p><p>In terms of funding, the Government has increased the Mental Health Budget from &euro;826 million in 2016 to over &euro;850 million this year.  This will enable the continued development of a range of services including Adult, Child &amp;amp; Adolescent, Forensic and Specialist services in mental health.  As part of this, funding of up to &euro;6 million will be made available to meet the mental health needs of the homeless.  In addition, &euro;5 million has been provided to extend the Counselling In Primary Care (CIPC) programme to under 18s and the recruitment of 114 Assistant Psychologists is expected to take place later this year.</p><p>In addition, substantial funding has been provided in 2017 for Mental Health capital projects, most notably to commence the construction of the new forensic hospital at Portrane this year.</p><p>Many of the above initiatives are contingent upon the recruitment of the necessary staff.  While difficulties in this area have been well-documented, mental health staffing has increased by around 200 over the last year to 9,717 WTEs.  To increase the supply of key personnel, we have also funded an extra 130 undergraduate places for psychiatric nurses.</p><p>Finally, work is continuing on the preparation of the general scheme of a bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 based on the recommendations of the 2015 Expert Review Group on the 2001 Act.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<ul type="disc"><li>Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </li><li>Bed and board;</li><li>Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</li><li>Laundry service.</li></ul></p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p></reply>

The World Health Organisation has set a global target to halt the rise in obesity by 2025. <i>&ldquo;A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rdquo;</i>will cover the ten year period until 2025 and sets targets to be achieved and actions that will produce measurable outcomes.  Twenty priority actions have been identified and work has commenced on the implementation of the majority of those priority actions already.  The timeframes for the other actions will operate over the lifespan of the policy which is 2016 - 2025.</p><p>Some specifics regarding actions which the Deputy has requested information on are as follows:</p><p>Action 1.4 - The Department of Health, in collaboration with the HSE is working with the Department of Education and Skills on the development of a 'whole of school' healthy lifestyle programme.  This approach includes schools curriculum, policies, environment and working with parents and the community.  Potable water provision is an integral part in policies pertaining to nutrition, physical activity and wellbeing of children.  My Department does not have a direct function in relation to rolling out initiatives in school settings as this is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.  However both Departments are in discussion on how best to progress measures relating to healthy lifestyles in the school setting.</p><p>Action 1.8 - My Department has published a paper regarding a levy on Sugar Sweetened Drinks - <i>&quot;Introducing a Tax on Sugar Sweetened Drinks - Health Rationale, Options and Recommendations,&quot; </i>which is available on the Department's website and which will support the Department of Finances' budget proposals to introduce a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy in 2018 and which is contained in the Programme for Government. </p><p>Action 1.10 - An amount of work has been undertaken and is ongoing in relation to the evidence review of fiscal measures on products that are high in fat, sugar and salt.  The Institute of Public Health is currently reviewing patterns of sugar sweetened drinks consumption as a contribution to this work.  This Department will continue research in this area including on factors that may influence behaviour change relating to diet.</p><p>Action 2.1 - Drafting has already commenced on potential terms of reference for the establishment of a working group to develop a set of guidelines in relation to the built environment.  The group will comprise relevant Government Departments, The Health Services Executive, County and City Councils, Academics and Professional Bodies among others.</p><p>The National Physical Activity Plan also contains a number of actions in relation to the built environment, including the development of guidelines and a programme of continuous professional development for those working in the built environment to promote the importance of physical activity.  However, the undertaking of an audit of schools and learning centres would be a matter for the Department of Education and Skills as my Department does not have responsibility for school infrastructure and development. </p><p>Action 10.2 - Certain preparatory work has been undertaken with regard to the requirements in relation to nutritional health surveillance.  Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data for use in planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice.  The annual Healthy Ireland Survey is among the activities undertaken by the Department to enhance the range of reliable information available to it.  The Survey was commissioned to enhance data collection and monitoring capacity in the implementation of Healthy Ireland.  The survey results include information on diet and nutrition including data on eating habits, the consumption of fruit and vegetables, the consumption of snacks and sugar sweetened drinks, and the use of folic acid supplements.  This is being utilised to advance our knowledge and understanding of the Obesity problem.</p><p>Two waves of the Survey have been published, and are available at:  .  A third report will be published later this year.</p></reply>

The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, the framework for improving health and wellbeing across the population.  One of the most important aspects of Healthy Ireland is the recognition that no single Government Department, organisation or agency can make Ireland a healthier nation, but that all sectors of society and the whole of Government need to be proactively involved in improving the health and wellbeing of the population. </p>  <p>  While my Department has responsibility for the strategic planning and coordination of the implementation of the Framework actions, the NPAP identifies and assigns responsibility for leadership on the implementation of specific actions to named Departments, organisations or agencies.  The NPAP has highlighted the need to encourage more children to be active.  A number of actions were included in the Plan and approved by Government to ensure that progress was made in supporting and encouraging more children to be active in school settings.  My Department does not have a direct function in relation to rolling out initiatives in school settings as this is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  In particular, actions 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 19 and 21 of the NPAP, which include initiatives to promote physical activity in schools, implement the contents of the physical education curriculum, and further develop teacher training, are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></reply>

Coillte is aware that this area is used a lot by recreational walkers and, over the last number of years, has spent some money on erecting signage for recreational users and on maintaining the walking tracks and trails in this area.  Coillte adds that, as part of its 2017 plans, it has allocated some money to Castlemorris woods to repair walking trails and I understand that this work will be carried out in the next few months. </p>  <p>  Coillte also advised that there was a recent harvesting operation at Castlemorris and that, in line with the company&rsquo;s normal forestry operations, the roads are currently being repaired post-harvesting.</p></reply>

This competitive grant aid Scheme is fully funded by the Irish Exchequer and provides up to 40% grant aid (50% for approved applicants under 35 years of age) towards the cost of approved capital investments in specialised horticultural equipment and buildings.  These include investments in bee breeding and honey production equipment as well as facilities e.g. honey houses, honey extractors and bottling equipment. Grant aid is not paid for bee colonies.  The minimum proposed investment for beekeepers is &euro;2,000 excluding VAT. </p>  <p>  In addition my Department also pays annual grants to Irish National Beekeepers associations to help their associated members and branches to pursue the craft of beekeeping to the highest standards and to also inform the general public about the environmental role that bees play in maintaining Irish bio-diversity and crop production. </p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of maintaining a healthy honey bee population the Department has put a number of measures in place over time.  These include establishment of a sentinel apiary programme, introduction of legislation relating to the control of diseases in bees, funding to cover the costs ofÂ bee disease diagnosis, controls on the imports of bees and co-funding of Ireland&rsquo;s National Apiculture Programme.</p>  <p>  The National Apiculture programme 2016-2019, which is co-funded by the EU and my Department, is providing annual funding totalling &euro;72,000 towards research projects aimed at improving overall honey bee health in Ireland.  The current National Apiculture Programme is exploring the efficacy of alternative controls for Varroa under Irish conditions as well as monitoring Irish over-winter colony losses, in addition to providing technical assistance to beekeepers through workshops and lectures at local associations of the federation of Irish Beekeepers.  This applied research programme has a strong emphasis on dissemination of results to beekeepers and is designed to benefit all Irish beekeepers. </p>  <p>  Potential funding for beekeeping groups is also available under the Scheme for Conservation of Genetic Resources to develop breeding programmes/strategies to protect the Irish Dark Native Honey Bees. </p>  <p>  This year my Department is providing further support through funding the cost of sample analysis for all samples submitted by beekeepers to the Bee Disease diagnostic service provided by Teagasc at Oakpark in Carlow. This means that beekeepers can now submit samples of bees or honey for disease diagnosis for free.</p></reply>

My Government colleague Minister Coveney sought agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar/bioethanol, at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry and this opportunityÂ has been broadly welcomed.</p>  <p>  Two commercial groupsÂ have conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar/bioethanol productionÂ facility but it is important that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by aÂ sufficiently robust business caseÂ in orderÂ to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required. </p>  <p>  The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (as amended by the 2015 ILUC Directive), limits to 7% the amount of energy from crop based biofuels, whose use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC), that Member States can count towards their 2020 renewable energy targets in transport.Â  In November 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Renewables Directive that envisages an overall European Union renewable energy target of at least 27% in 2030.  It is proposed in the draft Directive that the amount of energy from crop based biofuels which can be counted towards renewable transport targets in the period after 2020 will be progressively reduced to 3.8% in 2030. </p>  <p>  While recognising that a resource-efficient agriculture and land use sector can play an important role in supporting use of 2nd and 3rd generation biofuels, it is equally important that bio-fuel production deliver greenhouse gas savings and not impact negatively on food production and land use. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am alsoÂ pleased to confirm the currentÂ Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.  It is now available to those interested parties to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.</p></reply>

Â This includes life jackets, personal flotation devices and personal locator beacons (non-integrated). Â Grant aid is a maximum of 60% of eligible costs for vessels under 12 metres and 40% for other vessels, with Â maximum amounts of aid specified for different size vessels.</p>  <p>  The Enhanced Safety Scheme provides a one-day training course designed to provide skippers and crew of registered fishing vessels with up-to-date training in personal survival techniques, fist-aid, fire-prevention and health and safety in the workplace. Â TheÂ owner of a registered fishing vessel applies for this training in respect of his or her skipper and crew and pays a fee for each individual. Â The owner receives, for each course participant, a voucher to cover the full cost from designated outlets of a personal flotation device (PFD) with integrated personal locator beacon for use by the skipper or crew member while on board. Â The fee paid covers a portion of the cost of the PFD and the provision of the PFD is equivalent to a grant to the vessel owner of 40% to 60%, depending on vessel size. Â The PFD remains the property of the vessel owner, as he or she was the grant applicant and paid for the balance of the cost through the course fee. Â If the vessel owner disposes of the PFD within 5 years, he or she must refund BIM the value of the grant.</p>  <p>  Any skipper or crew member moving to a different vessel should be provided by the vessel owner with a PFD. Â Where necessary, the vessel owner should apply to BIM through the Enhanced Safety Scheme for a training and a new PFD for the individual concerned. Â A PFD may also be re-registered to the crew member's new vessel by agreement between the vessel owners.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25 million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;.  It was this exceptional aid package which facilitated the Scheme from an EU State Aid perspective and additional funding is not possible under this particular arrangement.  Other sectors, such as tillage and horticulture, were facilitated by national funding under the &lsquo;de minimis&rsquo; State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I am currently meeting with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agri-food sector.  I am asking the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p></reply>

In 2010 a report by Jim Power, Economic Consultant, commissioned by Bord na gCon, estimated that the greyhound racing industry was responsible for sustaining in excess of 10,000 full and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities, and injected an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies. </p><p>Successive Governments have recognised the importance of the greyhound racing industry, and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives down through the years.</p><p>Since 2002, well in excess of 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.</p><p>Annual attendances at greyhound racing declined over the course of the recession.  Greyhound racing was not immune from the impact of the downturn and in particular the reduction in consumer disposable income, emigration and the collapse in the construction industry.  Also, over the period of the recession Government support for the industry was reduced significantly which coincided with the effects of the economic downturn. This has been restored in recent years. </p><p>Bord na gCon has informed me that the consumers and fans of greyhound racing are now consuming the sport differently, with the growth in social media and online distribution of racing generally, audience engagement is expanding.  Bord na gCon state that attendance at greyhound stadia is beginning to stabilise in more recent times and saw an increase of 1% in 2016.  Clearly, however, the sector is struggling financially, and there is much more to do to stabilise its finances, increase revenues and improve its financial viability. </p><p>Bord na gCon recognises that the welfare of the greyhounds is paramount and it adopts the best identified practices to ensure that the highest welfare standards are achieved.  During 2016 circa &euro;1.8m was spent by Bord na gCon in support of Regulatory and Welfare efforts.  Bord na gCon will continue to enhance all aspects of greyhound welfare and ensure that the highest standards of performance and consistency are delivered when formulating strategy and appropriate policies.</p><p>As reported on the Bord na gCon website <i>www.igb.ie,</i>Bord na gCon, through its Welfare Officers, conducted in excess of 500 kennel inspections during 2016 and imposed 23 sanctions.</p><p>The Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, (which is jointly funded by Bord na gCon and contributions from owners), is primarily focused on the preparation of greyhounds for rehoming, including transportation, to the various European and U.S.  Rehoming Agencies along with providing assistance to Private Greyhound Rehoming Agencies.</p><p>Bord na gCon has informed me that Bord na gCon contributed the sum of circa &euro;95,000 to the Irish Greyhound Trust Fund in 2016 and in addition to this provided the sum of &euro;11,000 towards the neutering/spaying costs of greyhounds which were rehomed through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust Rehoming Scheme in 2016.</p><p>During 2015 and 2016 the Trust was successful in securing homes for 1,675 retired greyhounds, (694 were rehomed through agencies assisted by the Irish Greyhound Welfare Trust).</p><p>Where any breaches of welfare standards are identified under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, Bord na gCon has advised me that it takes stringent actions and prosecutions ensue in accordance with the Act.

After having carefully considered the matter, I decided that, without prejudice, there is a case for a review of the policy on allocations between the RSW Pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment of the fleet, taking account of request by the IS&amp;WFO.  In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.  All relevant issues will be carefully evaluated and subject to a full consultation with stakeholders before I decide if any amendment to the policy is justified for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishery.</p>  <p>  The public consultation process concluded on 28th February 2017 and 353 submissions were received. All submissions are currently being evaluated. </p>  <p>  To support transparency in this process, it is intended that all views received on the Consultation Document and/or any clarification provided will be publicly made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Following the closure of the formal consultation process, any meeting that may be held with stakeholders will be open to all interested stakeholders that have engaged in the public consultation.</p>  <p>  In relation to herring quota, as the Deputy may be aware, the Herring fishery consists of the Atlanto-Scandian Herring (ASH) Fishery, the Celtic Sea Herring (CSH) Fishery, the North West Herring (NWH) Fishery and the Irish Sea Herring Fishery.  Revised policy in relation to the management of herring stocks was announced in June 2012 following intensive consultation with industry and other key stakeholders</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be particularly interested in the NWH fishery. In this regard, the access arrangements for vessels to the main fishery was established in 2012 based on track record in 2010 and earlier years.  This is an autumn fishery and vessels eligible for this fishery are allocated an annual allocation. Up to 5% of the quota is also made available for vessels under 20m without a track record on the basis of modest monthly catch limits.  However, this policy for North West herring was set aside on an exceptional basis in 2016 following consultation with stakeholders to facilitate a wide scale scientific stock assessment, the main focus of which was to sample the stock. With this in mind, the overall adjusted quota for Ireland in 2016 was 2,703 tonnes and for 2017 is 2,112 tonnes.  Arrangements for the 2017 North West herring fishery to support continued data collection will be considered in consultation with stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Quotas are made available to the owners of licensed sea fishing boats by me in line with the provisions of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 as amended.  It is a matter for the owners of fishing vessels to decide the port of landing and I have no role in that regard.</p></reply>

To this end an inter-Departmental Task Force was formed by the Government.</p>  <p>  The report of the Government&rsquo;s Task Force on Non-EEA Workers in the Irish Fishing Industry recommended the establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system which is an extension of the existing Atypical Worker Permission schemes administered by the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &ndash; INIS).  The purpose of this scheme is to provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish commercial sea-fishing fleet.  This system was established and is operated through the co-operative efforts of my Department, my colleagues the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of this scheme under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, 11 Departments or Agencies were brought together and developed a &ldquo;Memorandum of Understanding for the Monitoring and Enforcement of the terms of Employment of non-EEA crewmen in parts of the Irish Commercial Sea Fishing Fleet pursuant to the establishment of the Atypical Worker Permission scheme&rdquo;.  Up to that point inspections on vessels were carried out primarily by the Marine Survey Office and the Health and Safety Authority.  Inspectors of the Workplace Relations Commission, based on newly acquired powers were trained and equipped, with support from a number of marine agencies, to board vessels and carry out their own inspections.  In the period 1st June, 2016 to 1st April, 2017 the WRC had inspected 80% of the fleet that comes within the aegis of the Atypical Worker Permission Scheme.  I am informed the WRC objective is to inspect the remainder by Summer 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department established and hosts a Central Depository, the purpose of which is to register the eligible contracts and supporting documentation required under the Scheme and to ensure that the ceiling of 500 contracts is not exceeded in any 12 month period.  The Department of Justice and Equality retains responsibility for immigration matters under the scheme while the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) put in place and led by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with relevant State enforcement bodies provides for a rigorous and effective inspection system.</p></reply>

There are market opportunities for animal exports which are separate from and additional to opportunities for meat and meat product exports.  The Deputy can be assured that both I and my Department will continue to make every effort to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can take place in both an economic and sustainable manner, with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported. </p>  <p>  My Department implements strong controls on the welfare of animals being exported, in particular through a comprehensive legislative framework relating to the transport of animals by sea (The Carriage of Livestock by Sea Regulations 2016 (S.I. 356 of 2016)).  Indeed, Irish legislative standards for sea transport are recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent legislation in force as regards transport by sea.  Only ships approved by my Department can load cattle for export from Ireland.  Cattle being exported are monitored during the prescribed isolation period by Veterinary Inspectors from my Department and in some cases by Official Veterinarians from the importing countries.  This is in addition to work carried out by Private Veterinary Practitioners who carry out the testing required prior to export to enable certification.  Animals are inspected and certified by Official Veterinarians from my Department with regard to their health status and fitness for travel before being loaded onto trucks or livestock vessels departing from Ireland. In addition, due regard is taken to weather conditions in respect of long distance transport and at times my Department makes arrangements to have veterinary assessment during transport and at point of arrival.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy. However, it is not practicable for my Department to impose EU standards on third countries.  My Department will continue to work closely with the people involved in the live export business, with other EU Member States and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), with a view to improving animal welfare (including slaughter) practices worldwide.</p></reply>

A significant amount of this funding (&euro;290,000) was allocated to the ISPCA and an additional amount of &euro;387,000 was provided to the ISPCA&rsquo;s affiliate member organisations.  A further amount of &euro;290,000 was awarded to the DSPCA. </p>  <p>  This higher level of funding supports increased enforcement by the ISPCA Inspectors and there are now eight Inspectors authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act (2013).  Their responsibilities include the enforcement of animal welfare legislation in seventeen counties around the country.  The work of the ISPCA is complemented by &lsquo;Service Agreements&rsquo; with the DSPCA (three DSPCA Inspectors) and with the Turf Club (five officials), with the result that there are now sixteen authorised officers employed by NGO&rsquo;s facilitating enforcement of equine welfare legislation throughout the entire country. </p>  <p>  A feature of enforcement of welfare legislation is that authorised officers from NGOs at times work alongside officials of my Department and the Local Authority on certain enforcement matters, resulting in a very effective and efficient use of resources.  The allocation of the funding referred to above to the DSPCA assists it greatly in enforcing equine welfare in the Dublin city and county area thus allowing for ISPCA to concentrate resources in other parts of the country.  It should be noted too that over 100 Veterinary Inspectors of my Department based in Regional Veterinary offices around the country have responsibilities which include the enforcement of equine welfare legislation.  Department officials also provide considerable administrative support to the ISPCA to assist its Inspectors in carrying out their work in protecting animal welfare</p>  <p>  Generous funding is also provided by my Department to other welfare bodies involved in protecting equine welfare, including the Donkey Sanctuary; the Blue Cross; the Irish Horse Welfare Trust and Hungry Horse Outside; all of whom are involved in protecting equines in one way or another.  Some of the recipients of this funding are working in conjunction with Local Authorities and are supported by my Department in developing facilities for urban and traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, having regard to the substantial funding provided by my Department to animal welfare organisations (including ISPCA and its affiliates), the implementation of the service level agreements with some of these organisations and the Turf Club and the inspection resources provided by my own Department, adequate resources are being devoted to the protection and enforcement of equine welfare.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  I understand that BnG, in view of its substantial debt burden, having considered the matter and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon Report, has decided to cease racing at Harold&rsquo;s Cross and initiate the sale of the stadium in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry.</p>  <p>  While the decision to close Harold's Cross was taken with regret, its view is that the interests of the sector as a whole are best served by concentrating Dublin racing activities in its national stadium, Shelbourne Park, which is located approximately two miles from Harold's Cross. </p>  <p>  Greyhound racing has been part of the Dublin landscape for many years and Bord na gCon has informed me that it is their intention that this continues to be the case and that it is further developed.</p>  <p>  Shelbourne Park has been operating 3 nights per week, which is limited use for a property in this location and with the facilities on offer.  There is sufficient capacity in Shelbourne Park to accommodate the Harold&rsquo;s Cross racing schedule there. </p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that Shelbourne Stadium remains open on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays for greyhound racing.  The current wave of protests has prevented entries for racing, therefore inhibiting the opportunity for customers to enjoy the live racing content. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Chairman and Board of Bord na gCon continue to discharge their functions and that against the background of a difficult operating environment over the past number of years, they are taking positive steps to address the issues identified in the Indecon Report, including those in relation to finance, governance and integrity services.</p>  <p>  I want to assure you that I am committed to securing the future of the greyhound industry. I presented the new Greyhound Industry Bill to Cabinet in early March.  The draft scheme has now been referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p>  <p>  The provision of a strong legal framework will support the development of the greyhound racing sector in Ireland and ultimately provide a platform to improve its contribution to the economy and employment.  It is my firm belief that the future of the greyhound industry is dependent on a strong governance platform, the industry having the highest standards of integrity founded on strong regulatory systems and robust animal welfare controls.</p></reply>

China has become an extremely important market for Irish seafood and restoration of this trade is particularly important for Irish seafood exporters ahead of BREXIT. </p>  <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) has been engaged with the Chinese authorities (AQSIQ) to achieve the necessary technical agreement on a methodology designed to resolve the issue of certification of live crab exports to China.  This agreement is built around implementation of a national monitoring programme of live crab intended for export to China.  The SFPA will implement the monitoring programme and certification will be built upon these criteria. </p>  <p>  As heretofore the Chinese authorities will continue to monitor consignments arriving in China and the SFPA will liaise with Irish industry to apprise seafood exporters of specific requirements to recommence live crab trade with China.</p></reply>

The Forest Park to which the Deputy refers, namely Killykeen Forest Park, Co. Cavan, is part of the Coillte forest estate. Coillte CGA was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as the management of their properties and related transactions, are the responsibility of the company.</p>  <p>  The company has, however, provided me with relevant information in relation to this matter.  I note, in the first instance, that, while the company is proposing to dispose of the Killykeen Holiday Village Complex, Killykeen Forest Park will not be affected by the proposed disposal.  It is also noted that while it forms part of the forest park, the Holiday Village Complex is separate to Killykeen Forest Park. As indicated, actual transactions are operational matters for Coillte.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Killykeen Holiday Village Complex has in effect been on the market since 2009, with a renewed marketing campaign launched in May 2016.  I am also advised, in relation to the stage of the proposed disposal, that the transaction is at an advanced stage of negotiation, and that Coillte are optimistic that a completion is imminent.  With reference to the Deputy&rsquo;s query about safeguards, Coillte advise that, in evaluating the submissions from interested parties, the company is taking into consideration their respective business development proposals for the Holiday Complex.</p>  <p>  As regards consultation with the local community, I understand that this Complex, which contains circa 30 hectares, has not been open to the general public since 2009 and, as such, the local community will not be adversely affected by the proposed disposal. Coillte also advise that the Forest Park is and will remain open to the general public.</p>  <p>  Coillte add that it has considered the social value of the business, and are optimistic that a new owner will invest and redevelop the Holiday Village Complex, thereby creating a valuable tourism resource in this area. I am advised that fishing rights will not be impacted and access to Killykeen Forest Park will not be restricted by the proposed disposal of Killlykeen Holiday Village Complex. </p>  <p>  I understand, from Coillte, that no direct consultation on the sale of the Holiday Village Complex was held with Cavan County Council.  Coillte add that, as part of Coillte&rsquo;s consultation process for property sales, the company consults with all stakeholders directly affected by the proposed sale and, due to the nature of use of the Holiday Village Complex, Cavan County Council was not one of these stakeholders. Coillte advise, that, as part of other discussions with Cavan County Council, the proposed sale of the Village Complex has been noted and the Council is aware of the proposed sales process. </p></reply>

No. 675 of 2006 and the Carriage of Livestock by Sea Regulations 2016 (S.I. 356 of 2016) which regulates the transport of animals by sea in livestock vessels. My Department has availed of provisions in the European legislation which allows for stricter national rules to be implemented in relation to sea transport and we continue to apply stricter and more detailed requirements than those provided for in EU legislation in this area. </p>  <p>  Live animals destined for export are also subject to EU regulations relating to animal health and welfare as well as to certification requirements agreed between Ireland and third country authorities. Cattle destined for live export are monitored by Department Veterinary Inspectors at the time of loading and during the prescribed isolation period in Ireland where an isolation period is required by the importing country. This is in addition to any inspections that may be carried out by Official Veterinarians from the country of destination of the animals. Private Veterinary Practitioners (PVP) also undertake the testing and certification required prior to export. Only animals certified fit to travel are loaded onto trucks under the supervision of Department Veterinary Inspectors. At Port of departure, the animals are unloaded from the trucks and walk onto the dedicated livestock ship and this process is also supervised by my Department officials.  Cattle who are penned on board a livestock ship will typically be in very similar conditions to any feedlot situation. </p>  <p>  Irish legislative standards for sea transport are recognised by the EU Commission as being amongst the most effective and stringent legislation in force as regards transport by sea. Only ships that have been surveyed and approved by independent Marine Surveyor in conjunction with Department Veterinary Inspectors can load cattle for export from Ireland. </p>  <p>  At the time of the first shipment of cattle to Turkey at end of September 2016, a PVP accompanied the load from Ireland to Turkey. My Department arranged for a Veterinary Inspector to fly to Turkey to monitor the cattle on arrival and at unloading. In all cases to date the feedback as regards the welfare, quality and health of the Irish cattle that have been transported by boat to Turkey has been very positive.</p></reply>

Its particular exposure to the UK market is exemplified by the fact that almost 80% of wood-based panel exports and 70% of sawn timber exports go to the UK. I am also aware of the anticipated increase in the volume of roundwood supply over the next two decades, from a current annual production of almost 4 million cubic metres to 8 million by 2035. Most of this increase is expected to come from private forestry owners, and the current expectations are that the vast majority of the timber is destined for the UK market.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Government remains focused on supporting the forestry sector through the challenges that lie ahead, including those related to competitiveness, potentially increased competition and reduced demand from the UK market.  </p>  <p>  I and my Department, together with our agencies and stakeholders, are continuing to examine those areas, including forestry, in which the greatest risks may arise from Brexit, and on which we will need to focus when the negotiations begin. In the meantime, we continue to progress our analysis of the likely implications of Brexit, to increase our engagement with Member States and EU institutions, and to further our consultations with stakeholders. In the latter regard, the forestry sector was represented at the most recent All-Island Sectoral dialogue that I hosted in February, and continues to participate in my Department's Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which met most recently on 11 April.  </p>  <p>  I can assure you that all of the Department&rsquo;s ongoing activities will continue to be informed by the need to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.  Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team and looks forward to working with fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU from the Brexit negotiations. </p></reply>

However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  </p><p>Any attempt by the UK to increase its current quota shares at the expense of Ireland and others must, and will be, be resisted strenuously. </p><p>Earlier this year, I hosted a dedicated Civic Dialogue on the potential impacts of Brexit for the seafood sector as whole. This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that a 'hard' Brexit presents for our fishing communities.  </p><p>I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.</p><p>I am continuing to work closely with my European colleagues to ensure that fisheries remain a top priority in the negotiations to come. Protecting existing shares is a top priority for the fishing Member States.  </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.  </p></reply>

The ANC scheme replaces the previous Disadvantaged Areas Scheme / Less Favoured Areas Scheme.  The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors. Under the new Rural Development Regulation, eligible areas must instead be designated using a set list of bio-physical criteria. In cases where a Member State does not introduce this new system for payment, the old scheme remains in place but payments must phase out on a digressive basis. </p><p>The biophysical criteria set out in the legislation to underpin the new system of designation are: </p><p>- Low temperature  </p><p>- Dryness </p><p>- Excess soil moisture </p><p>- Limited soil drainage </p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness </p><p>- Shallow rooting depth </p><p>- Poor chemical properties </p><p>- Steep slope.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on this project, and relevant technical experts are currently working on sourcing and analysing the data in relation to the new criteria. Department officials have also been in contact with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and DG Agri in the EU Commission in relation to technical issues arising.  This analysis will identify areas deemed to be facing natural constraints, which will in parallel be subjected to a refinement process.  It is envisaged that stakeholders will be consulted as this process develops. </p></reply>

After having carefully considered the matter, I decided that, without prejudice, there is a case for a review of the policy on allocations between the RSW Pelagic segment and the polyvalent segment of the fleet, taking account of the request by the IS&amp;WFO.  In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note thatÂ I haveÂ not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.  All relevant issues will be carefully evaluated and subject to a full consultation with stakeholders before I decide if any amendment to the policy is justified for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishery.</p>  <p>  The public consultation process concluded on 28th February 2017 and 353 submissions were received.Â Â I can inform the Deputy that the party that made the submission of 4 April 2017Â to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine also made similar submissions in the context of the public consultation process.  All submissions received in that process are currently being evaluated. </p>  <p>  To support transparency in this process, it is intended that all views received on the Consultation Document and/or any clarification provided will be publicly made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  Following the closure of the formal consultation process, any meeting that may be held with stakeholders will be open to all interested stakeholders that have engaged in the public consultation.Â  </p>  <p>  The case submitted to me by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been made also as part of the stakeholders consultation on this review.Â  It is important to note, however, that quotas are made available to the owners ofÂ licensed sea fishing boats by meÂ in line with the provisions of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 as amended.Â Â It is a matter for the owners of fishing vessels to decide the port of landing and I have no role in that regard.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  My Department&rsquo;s contribution of &euro;25million includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The participating banks will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.Â  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, I will shortly make preliminary information on the Scheme available.  The banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down</p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I am currently meeting with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other issues relating access to finance in the agri-food sector.  IÂ am asking the banks to respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.</p></reply>

Ireland fully supports this approach andÂ its early implementation.Â  The EUÂ positionÂ in this area is managed by the Technical Committee - Motor Vehicles.Â  The Road Safety Authority, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is the agencyÂ attending thatÂ committee's meetingsÂ on behalf of Ireland.  From 1 September 2017, the new RDE tests will be compulsory to determine whether a new car model is allowed to be put on the market.  I am, of course,Â conscious of the links across different policy sectors.Â  With this in mind, my Department recently undertook a public consultation on Ireland's first ever national Clean Air Strategy.Â  The strategy will provide a framework for a formal set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions from all sources, including transport, thereby improving our air quality and public health.Â  I look forward to engaging with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his Department, through the strategyÂ formulation process,Â to identifyÂ all practical means of reducing emissions from the transport sector.</p></reply>

The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.Â  The NBP procurement process is following the &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; model and intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing.</p><p>Following the Competitive Dialogue stage, the next step in the process is to formally invite bidders to submit detailed solutions which will be evaluated by the Department in line with the approved evaluation methodology<b>.</b>This in turn will be followed byÂ theÂ issue ofÂ the final tender.Â  The evaluation of final tenders will lead to the selection of a preferred bidder(s)Â fit to fully deliver on the Government&rsquo;s objective of a truly open-access, wholesale network that delivers quality, affordable high speed broadband services to all premises in the intervention area. </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.Â  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.Â  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.Â  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>OnÂ 4 April, IÂ signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to itsÂ plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  EirÂ has committed to doing this work over aÂ 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.Â  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eirÂ meets itsÂ obligations under the Agreement.Â  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.Â  </p><p>On the same day IÂ publishedÂ  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie whichÂ finalises theÂ State Intervention area for the remainder of the procurement process.Â  TheÂ updated Map showsÂ the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or haveÂ indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will requireÂ State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.Â Â </p><p>The map shows thatÂ  the townland of Peast, Co Monaghan and 21% of the townland of Townparks (EdBallyhaise) Co Cavan which includes Annalee Manor Housing EstateÂ fallsÂ within the AMBER area and willÂ be included in theÂ State Intervention.  The remaining 79% of the townland of Townparks (ED Ballyhaise) falls within the BLUE area and willÂ be covered by commercial operators.Â  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUEÂ or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.Â  TheÂ three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.Â  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard,Â in July 2016,Â together withÂ Minister Humphreys I established theÂ Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce toÂ identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigateÂ how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  TheÂ report of the Task Force was published in December andÂ isÂ available at the following link: .  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,Â ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviateÂ some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of theseÂ actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assistÂ local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days onÂ progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly. </p><p>In addition, I haveÂ signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This willÂ provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocateÂ this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

While the existing TV licence fee model has provided a measure of stabilityÂ to date, the rapid changes in technology altering the traditional way in which television is watched, together with economic pressures generally, are having a growing impact on the funding now being provided by the model and raise a serious question mark over the future ability of the current model to continue to provide stable funding for public service media in the longer term. </p>  <p>  With this in mind,Â in October last year I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment to examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media.Â  As the Deputy may be aware,Â the Committee is currently considering this issue following a period of public consultation and stakeholder engagement.  I look forward to receiving their report in due course which will help inform future funding policy for public service media in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, IÂ am alsoÂ bringing proposals to CabinetÂ for amending the Broadcasting Act 2009.Â  In addition I asked theÂ Office of Government Procurement to issue a RequestÂ forÂ Information to see whatÂ services the market may be able to offer in respect of TV Licence collection.  This will help inform any tender process once the legislative amendments are in place to provide for a procurement process.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, there will be no change to the existing TVÂ licence fee arrangements.</p></reply>

Subsequent to this, the On Demand Audiovisual Services Group (ODAS) was established under the auspices of IBEC andÂ a Code of Conduct was devised which applies to all on-demand audio-visual service providers operating in the state.Â  My Department has no role in respect of the membership ofÂ ODASÂ and there is no Departmental representative on the group.  Further details in respect of ODAS and its current membership are available from IBEC.</p>  <p>  In devising the Code, ODAS was required to co-operate with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) in relation to the Code&rsquo;s development and the final Code required the BAI&rsquo;s approval.  The Code of Conduct was last reviewed by ODAS, in consultation with the BAI, in 2014.Â  In terms of the Code&rsquo;s operation, the BAI&rsquo;s only role is thatÂ its statutory Compliance Committee acts as an appeals body, where a complainant is not satisfied with the decision of the on-demand service provider, on complaints relating to content.Â  In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place between the BAI&rsquo;s Compliance Committee and ODAS.Â  The BAI does not have a role in relation to any complaints appeals in respect of commercial communications.Â  This appeals function is carried out by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland (ASAI).</p>  <p>  In relation to the BAI&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Commercial Communications Code, this Code makes specific provision for rules regarding the advertisement of foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS).Â  This Code is scheduled for review over the next 12 to18 months and it is my understanding that the BAIÂ intends undertaking research as part of the review and will have regard to the experience in Ireland since the Code&rsquo;s introduction.Â  The BAI will also consider regulatory practices in other jurisdictions andÂ plans toÂ consult extensively with relevant stakeholders including the Department of Health, who have primary responsibility for promoting WHO protocols, as part of the review process.  In addition, the BAI participated in a working group, established by the Minister for Health in 2015, to develop rules for marketing communications for food including HFSS on digital media;Â the working group has now concluded and a draft code is expected to be submitted to the Department of Health shortly.</p></reply>

Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together withÂ Minister Humphreys toÂ identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigateÂ how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  TheÂ report of the Task Force was published in December andÂ is available on both Departments' websites.Â </p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,Â ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviateÂ some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of theseÂ actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assistÂ local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This Group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This Group will be formally reporting every 90 days onÂ progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in the coming weeks.</p><p>The benefits that the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report will bring will be felt across Ireland.</p><p>In addition to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force, other initiatives are underway to enhance services across the State.  I haveÂ signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This willÂ provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.Â </p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocateÂ this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.Â Â </p><p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets andÂ the capacity of the network, as well as byÂ and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. </p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.Â  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.Â  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.Â  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4 April, IÂ signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to itsÂ plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.Â  EirÂ has committed to doing this work overÂ a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.Â  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eirÂ meets itsÂ obligations under the Agreement.Â  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.Â  </p><p>On the same day IÂ publishedÂ  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. whichÂ finalises theÂ State Intervention area.  TheÂ updated Map showsÂ the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or haveÂ indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will requireÂ State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.Â Â </p><p>The map shows that the eircodes referred to by the DeputyÂ Â within the townlands of Ballygroman Lower and <font color="#444444">Barrahaurin are in the AMBER area and will require State Intervention.Â In addition the MapÂ shows that</font>79% of the townland of Ballynora and 100% of the townland of Curraheen (Ed Inishkenny)Â Co CorkÂ fall within the AMBER area and will also be part of the State Intervention.Â  The remaining 21% of the townland of Ballynora falls within the BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators and includes 2% of premises where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by 2018. Â Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUEÂ or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.Â The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders canÂ progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.The Â three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.Â </p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.Â </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand andÂ a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard,Â I establishedÂ a Mobile Phone and BroadbandÂ Task Force in July 2016Â together withÂ Minister Humphreys toÂ identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigateÂ how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. TheÂ report of the Task Force was published in December andÂ isÂ  available at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,Â ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviateÂ some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of theseÂ actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assistÂ local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In addition, I haveÂ signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This willÂ provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.Â </p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocateÂ this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.Â Â </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.Â </p></reply>

The scheme will carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members and will be funded by a visible Environmental Management Cost (vEMC).Â  All operators will be obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the market. This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard. It will be mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.Â  </p>  <p>  Monaghan County Council received funding in 2016 from my Department for the clean-up of tyres stockpiled in their functional area.

Once an application is made, contractors operating on behalf of SEAI survey the home to determine what measures are most suitable for that home. Once a survey has been completed, homes are issued to SEAI&rsquo;s panel of appointed contractors and works typically proceed within a matter of days. Demand for the scheme remains strong, clearly demonstrating its potential to continue to deliver energy efficiency gains and related benefits, such as reduced energy costs and better health outcomes.</p><p>In March of this year I announced that a limited amount of deep retrofits will be available to those people who are eligible for the scheme and living in the poorest quality homes. SEAI are currently recruiting contractors to deliver these deeper efficiency measures on a nationwide basis and I expect the new upgrades to be available from this summer.

For the 2017 season, some 48 rivers are open with an exploitable surplus andÂ 27 rivers are open to catch and release angling with no harvestable surplus. </p>  <p>  In that context, the retention of the provision prohibiting the sale of rod caught wild salmon is considered an essential component of national conservation and protection policy.Â This and similar measures applying to other types of angling, such as restricting the numbers and sizes of fish that can be harvested, are all aimed at ensuring the long term survival ofÂ valuable recreational angling fish stocks.</p>  <p>  All salmon caught in Ireland must be tagged with a gill tag and logged to show where the fish was taken and whether taken by rod and line or in a commercial fishery. Â Imported salmon are tagged with a tail tag. Restaurants selling, commercially caught or imported wild salmon for consumption are required to retain the appropriate tags and records which are subject to inspection, for compliance with statutory provisions, by IFI.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.Â  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.Â  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.Â  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p>  <p>  OnÂ 4 April, IÂ signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to itsÂ plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.Â  EirÂ has committed to doing this work over aÂ 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.Â  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eirÂ meets itsÂ obligations under the Agreement.Â  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie.Â  </p>  <p>  On the same day IÂ publishedÂ  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. whichÂ finalises theÂ State Intervention area.  TheÂ updated Map showsÂ the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p>  <p>   - The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or haveÂ indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p>  <p>   - The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will requireÂ State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.Â Â </p>  <p>  There are circa 89,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 13,000 (14%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.Â  The remaining c76,000 (75%) premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators and includes approx. 9,000 (12%)Â  where eir is planning to deliver high speed broadband by 2018. </p>  <p>  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUEÂ or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie </p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.Â The level of subsidy that will be sought by bidders to roll-out high speed broadband in Amber areas of the High Speed broadband Map, will be established through that procurement process. NoÂ subsidy is paid towards the investment by commercial operators in rolling out high speed broadband in the Blue areas of the map. </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand andÂ a prioritisation programme.</p></reply>

Under these criteria all biofuels, including biodiesel produced from palm oil, may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas.Â  </p>  <p>  In addition, the 2015 ILUC Directive limits to 7% the amount of energy from crop based biofuels, whose use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC) that Member States can count towards their 2020 renewable energy targets in transport. I anticipate the ILUC Directive will be transposed into Irish legislation by my Department by the deadline of 10 September 2017.</p>  <p>  In November 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a new Renewables Directive that envisages an overall European Union renewable energy target of at least 27% in 2030.Â  It is proposed in the draft Directive that the amount of energy from crop based biofuels which can be counted towards renewable energy shares in transport (RES-T)Â in the period after 2020 will be progressively reduced from 7% in 2020 to 3.8% in 2030.</p>  <p>  Biofuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, may not deliver required greenhouse gas savings and could impact negatively on food production and land use.Â  It is important, therefore, that measures are in place to mitigate against environmental risks, such as Indirect Land-Use Change, of certain categories of biofuels.Â  It is also important that the development of advanced biofuels, which pose little risk of ILUC, are encouraged.Â  Both the ILUC Directive and the proposed new Renewables Directive contain measures to incentivise the production of such biofuels.</p></reply>

Emissions from transport, including particulate emissions, can have a detrimental impact on both environmental ecosystems and human health.Â  Inhalation of Particulate Matter (PM) can increase respiratory morbidity (including exacerbation of existing conditions such as asthma) as well as contributing to cardiovascular disease.</p>  <p>  A significant contributor to the rise in NOx emissions in recent years throughout the EU has been the higher than expected emissions from the new fleet of road vehicles, particularly diesel vehicles.Â  Over time, discrepancies have come to light between the emissions recorded from vehicles during emissions testing and &lsquo;real&rsquo; driving.</p>  <p>  Given the nature of both auto manufacture and the EU&rsquo;s single market, a coordinated European response across all Member States is necessary.Â  The regulatory shortcomings highlighted by this issue are being addressed at EU level through the adoption of a revised emissions test cycle, that incorporates elements of real world driving. Ireland fully supports thisÂ approach andÂ its early implementation.Â  </p>  <p>  At a national level, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are co-chairing a Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies. The work of the task force has been divided into two phases, with the first phase focusing solely on electric vehicles. The Task Force expects to report on an interim basis to Government on the first phase by June 2017, with associated recommendations. These recommendations will suggest a range of options for facilitating greater uptake of EVs in the coming years.</p>  <p>  My Department has also commenced work on the first ever National Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching strategic policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities. The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including diesel emissions, in an integrated manner. A public consultation on the strategy closed last week.</p></reply>

Though petrol and diesel road vehicles have met progressively tighter EU emission limits, known as Euro standards, since the early 1990s, increases in road traffic, changes to theÂ ratio of diesel to petrol vehicles, questions over the efficacy of the Euro standards in real driving conditions,Â as well asÂ the behaviour of some vehicle manufacturers, mean that the air pollution impact from road transport still presents a significant challenge. </p>  <p>  The use of biofuelsÂ such as ethanol (or biodiesel for diesel cars)Â can help to reduce emissions,Â particularly carbon dioxide emissions,Â from road transport.Â  Since 1 July 2010, Ireland has operatedÂ a Biofuels Obligation Scheme which is administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) and requires road transport fuel suppliers to bring increasing amounts of biofuel to the transport fuel market.Â  TheÂ obligation has been increased over the years since the beginning of the scheme, with the most recent increase bringing it to 8.695%Â from 1 January 2017.Â  </p>  <p>  The use of biofuels is not, however, without potential drawbacks, which can include the displacement of food production, or habitat destruction for the purposes of clearing land for biofuel production.Â  Strict sustainability criteria must be applied to biofuels under the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) before they can be counted towards Member State&rsquo;s renewable energy targets.Â  Under these criteria, biofuels may not be made from raw materials originating from tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatland, wetland or highly biodiverse areas.Â  </p>  <p>  In addition,Â the European Commission adopted Directive (EU) 2015/1513 (also known as the Indirect Land-Use ChangeÂ  or ILUC Directive) in September 2015. This Directive limits to 7% the amount of energy that Member States can count towards their 2020 renewable energy targets in transport from crop based biofuels whose use could lead to indirect land-use change.Â  It also contains incentives to encourage the development of advanced biofuels that do not affect food production. The ILUC Directive will be transposed into Irish legislation by September 2017.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that the solution ofÂ any environmental problem, such as air pollution in Ireland,Â is not at the cost of creating a greater environmental problem elsewhere.Â  </p>  <p>  I am currently developing Ireland's first ever National Clean Air StrategyÂ to advance a coherent cross Government framework for decision making on policies and actions that can impact air quality and pollution from all sources, including road transport.Â  A public consultation on the Strategy closed last week.</p></reply>

Following aÂ public consultation process,Â it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p><p>An &lsquo;all-island&rsquo; research study commenced in February 2014 into policy options to deal with the problem of airborne pollution from residential fuel combustion, in particular, smoky coal. The study, undertaken under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, was finalised in December 2015, and subsequently presented to Ministers.Â  The report supports the extension of the ban areas in Ireland and smoke control areas in Northern Ireland. While I would like to see a joint approach by authorities to the introduction of an all island ban on smoky coal, it is of course also a matter for authorities in Northern IrelandÂ to consider in relation to that jurisdiction.Â  Notwithstanding the timing of decisions in the North and the position taken there, I am committed to extending the ban nationwide in this jurisdiction.Â  </p><p>This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, the residential fuel industry, and the general public.Â  DiscussionsÂ  with many of these stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway.</p><p>My Department is currently developing a national Clean Air Strategy which will provide the strategic framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions, and consequential health impacts, by improving our air quality. A public consultation process on the strategy concluded last week. The strategy will also address a wide range of other national policies that are relevant to air quality such as transport, energy and agriculture. Residential home heating is a key source of air pollution, in particular from solid fuel and smoky coal, and as such there is a pre-existing commitment to extend the smoky coal ban nationwide by 2018.Â  IÂ expect that the strategy will be published by the end of 2017 andÂ that IÂ will to be to be in a position to implement the national ban in time for the heating season of 2018, that is the third quarter of that year.<font color="#1F497D">Â </font></p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.Â  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.Â  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>OnÂ 4 April, IÂ signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to itsÂ plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.Â  EirÂ has committed to doing this work over aÂ 90 week period, an average of 500 premises passed per day.Â  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eirÂ meets itsÂ obligations under the Agreement.Â  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.Â  </p><p>On the same day IÂ publishedÂ  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. whichÂ finalises theÂ State Intervention area.TheÂ updated Map showsÂ the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or haveÂ indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will requireÂ State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.Â Â </p><p>The map shows that 98% of the townland of Fountainstown, Â Cork falls within the AMBER area and will require State Intervention.Â  The remaining 2% of the townland Â fall Â within the BLUE area and willÂ  covered by commercial operators.Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUEÂ or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.Â  The Â three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.Â  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p><p>In this regard,Â I established the Task Force in July 2016Â together withÂ Minister Humphreys toÂ identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigateÂ how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. TheÂ report of the Task Force was published in December andÂ isÂ  available at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,Â ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders. The report contains 40 actions that will alleviateÂ some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of theseÂ actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers. </p><p>  The work of the Task Force will also assistÂ local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March. This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions. This group will formally report every 90 days onÂ progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys. I am expecting the first such quarterly report shortly. </p><p>In addition, I haveÂ signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band. This willÂ provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.Â </p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocateÂ this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.Â Â </p><p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Â This Government has supported that role through the 11% cumulative increase I secured in Budget 2017 for both the Public Service Obligation (PSO) programme and the Rural Transport Programme.</p>  <p> Â That increase means that in 2017 approximately &euro;277 million be available to the National Transport Authority to support the delivery of these important programmes, which underpin the delivery of taxpayer funded bus services across rural Ireland. Â I have committed publicly to further increasing the funding of those programmes in the future as resources allow.Â  Publicly funded bus services in rural Ireland are expanding and improving and that is reflected in the increases in passenger numbers, particularly within Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO network.</p>  <p>  That Exchequer financial support is supported at a policy level by the commitment given within the Programme for a Partnership Government to review public transport policy so as to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy.Â  I am glad to say that this commitment is also reflected within the actions contained within Realising our Rural Potential - Action Plan for Rural Development which specifically references the rural transport dimension and the needs of rural communities.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt the Deputy is aware that across rural Ireland the publicly funded bus services are complemented by a huge range of privately operated bus services.Â  These bus services are provided by operators under licence from the National Transport Authority pursuant to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and contrary to some reports are not solely focused on major inter-urban routes, but are also frequently found connecting rural towns and villages across the State. Â In 2015 around 23 million people travelled on a commercial bus service, which represents approximately 9% of all public transport journeys that year.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority has assured rural Ireland that it has the statutory powers available to it to ensure continued public transport connectivity for communities who may lose services in cases where a commercial operator introduces service changes.Â The NTA has used those powers in the past and will do so again in the future if required.</p></reply>

At present, we already allow them a waiver from the usual requirement to be a learner for six months before taking the driving test.Â <font color="#34153D">The requirement to undergo a programme of 12 &lsquo;Essential Driver Training&rsquo; lessons for all learners is currently being reviewed byÂ by my officialsÂ to see whether a more limited programme can be tailored to people with full licences from non-exchange countries.</font>I do believe a programme of training would be of benefit, given that these are people used to driving in different conditions and with different laws, but I think that the training requirements could be reduced in such cases.</p></reply>

My Department is represented on the Economy and Trade Group and also on the Aviation and related Tourism sub-groups under these structures.

This Group has extensively considered the aviation implications of Brexit and has met with the Department's representative on the Interdepartmental Group of Senior Officials to discuss the concerns of the aviation industry.  Representatives of the Group have also met with senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach in relation to those concerns.  The outcome of these consultations informs the analyses of the Department and feeds into the overall analyses of Government.</p>  <p>  I have had a number of interactions with the Chair of daa on a range of matters relevant to the Company.  However, I have not met with daa to discuss Brexit specifically. Â </p>  <p>  Aviation services between the UK and Ireland and within the EU operate within the EU Single Aviation Market.  In order to maintain liberal access from the UK to Ireland and the rest of the EU, a new aviation agreement between the UK and the remaining 27 EU Member States will be required.  In the absence of suchÂ a replacement aviation transport agreement, existing traffic rights could be negatively impacted, including the rightsÂ of Irish licensed airlines to fly between the UK and Ireland, the UK and the rest of the EU, within the UK, and between the UK and a range of other third countries.</p>  <p>  The full implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the single aviation market will only become clear once formal Brexit negotiations commence.  The Government will continue to plan for and mitigate the associated risks of Brexit throughout the EU/UK withdrawal process.</p></reply>

While the transport element of the Capital Plan did provide for some targeted investment in a number of new projects in the Munster region, it was not possible to include the M20 in the Capital Plan as the scale of investment to deliver it was not affordable.Â Â </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the potential regional development benefits of an upgrade of the Cork to Limerick link andÂ in this regard I agreed to TII spending &euro;1 million toÂ review the status of work undertaken previously and to update certain inputs including traffic studies.  I do expect that the status of the Cork to Limerick road link will be examined as part of the Review of the Capital Plan which is under way.  In relation to the Narrow Water Bridge project, while the Capital Plan outlines the GovernmentÂ commitment to the concept of the Bridge, it does not provide specific funding for the project.  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government agreed to undertake a review of the proposed Narrow Water Bridge project with a view to identifying options for its future development, for consideration by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).Â </p>  <p>  Discussions have been under way at senior official level with the Northern Ireland authorities regarding co-operation on commitments in the Fresh Start Agreement, including the Narrow Water Bridge project.  Pending the outcome of consideration of options in relation to the proposed project, no provision has been made for project funding.Â </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start - reaffirmed the Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;50 million for the A5 project and committed an additional &pound;25 million to ensure that Phase 1 of the project (New buildings to north of Strabane) can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities.  A specific allocation for the A5 project has not been provided to this DepartmentÂ under the Capital Plan.</p></reply>

In addition, informationÂ on the number of participants who engage with Local Sports Partnership programmes and initiativesÂ isÂ published annually.</p>  <p>  The Irish Sports Monitor is a large scale population based survey designed to capture information on active and social participation in sport and exercise among adults aged 16 years or older.  TheÂ Irish Sports Monitor ReportÂ is published by Sport Ireland on a bi-annual basis.  The 2015 Report shows that almost 1.6 million Irish adults participate in sportÂ regularly.  Fieldwork is currently underway for the 2017 Irish Sports Monitor.  In relation to participation by children,Â the Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity StudyÂ commissioned by Sport Ireland and published inÂ 2010Â is a detailed survey of participation in sport, physical activity and physical education among children aged 10-18.</p>  <p>  One of the Government's key priorities for sport is toÂ increase the levels of participation in sportÂ in order thatÂ people can enjoy the health, social and economic benefits that arise from sport.  In addition, the overarching targetÂ of the National Physical Activity Plan is to increase the proportion of the population across each life stage undertaking regular physical activity by 1% per annum.

To advance this commitment, the Deputy might also be aware that I recently announced my intention to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue on the issue of Public Transport.</p>  <p>  It is vital that stakeholders have the opportunity to voice their opinions on public transport policy issues and these issues are then considered as part of the formal policy review.  I believe that a Stakeholder Dialogue provides the appropriate forum to allow stakeholders to make a meaningful contribution towards policy development.  It is also important that the Review will take cognisance of recent developments in other relevant areas of public policy such as the preparation of a new National Planning Framework, the Action Plan for Rural Development, a National Mitigation Plan and Climate Adaption Paper for the transport sector.  My Department is currently scoping out the proposed approach to the work.  The full Review will then take place as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The submission deadline for the mid-term review of the Capital Plan did not allow for the completion of the significant body of work and consultation required to undertake a comprehensive review of public transport policy.  With regard to the evidence base for my Department's submission, there is already a significant amount of evidence to support the transport priorities set out in the Capital Plan.  The Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport in particular, provides the basis for the key priorities which are intended to guide transport investment decisions.  Furthermore, my Department applies a robust system of economic appraisal and all project proposals are fully appraised and reviewed by an in-house economic analysis team before sanction is given.</p></reply>

The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  Projects already completed or at any advanced level over the period 2015-2018 including Luas Cross City, the recently completed Phoenix Park Tunnel, additional bus fleet and bus lane infrastructure, small scale interventions on the M50 andÂ other measures will go some way to addressing growing travel demand in the GDA.  The NTA's GDA Strategy proposes a number of large scale projectsÂ including the DART Expansion Programme, new Metro North, andÂ other light rail projects which will be delivered over the medium term and will significantly improve capacity in the public transport network in the GDA.</p>  <p>  However, in the short to medium term, it will be necessary to radically improve the bus system to deliver a step change in performance across the GDAÂ in order to tackle congestion and increasing levels of demand.  Approximately &euro;800 million is allocated over the lifetime of theÂ Government's Capital Plan 2016&ndash;2021 for bus measures.  This includes fleet replacement and enlargement programmes for both the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO fleets; and for bus network infrastructure development in the GDA and Regional Cities andÂ bus rapid transitÂ programmes in the GDA.  In order to deliver the step change in performance that is required in the GDA, further funding will be needed and I am making the case for increased investment as part of the Mid-Term Review of theÂ Capital Plan that is currently under way.</p>  <p>  In 2017, funding has been provided to the NTA to facilitate the purchase of 110 new buses for the Dublin Region.  The exact numbers to be added to the fleet in each of the next 4-5Â years will be determined when the capital review is completed and the revised capital allocation for public transport for the remaining period of the capital plan is clear.</p></reply>

The Deputy is presumably aware that section 37 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 (Disclosure of interests by members of staff)Â sets out the legal framework as regards disclosure of interests by NTA employees. Â In addition employees above certain grades are of course also subject to the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office Acts.  In addition to this statutory position, the NTA also has its own &quot;Code of Conduct forÂ Staff Members&quot; which is available to view on their websiteÂ .  This Code provides a framework to guide the work of theÂ NTA in order that ethical practices are followed and confidence and trust in the Authority is established and maintained and I note that the first of the five main principles covered by that Code is &quot;Conflict of Interest&quot;.</p><p>IÂ amÂ satisfied therefore that issues relating to any potential conflict of interest are sufficently provided for in both statute and the NTA's own Code.</p></reply>

I recently published the LEO annual jobs survey results which highlights three consecutive years of local jobs growth throughout the country.  Overall in 2016 there was a net increase of 3,679 jobs and total direct employment among LEO client companies stood at 34,634.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland client companies are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.  There are now over 201,000 people employed by EI supported companies across the country.  The fact that over 130,000 (65%) of those 201,000 jobs are outside of Dublin is significant.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 will support more Irish companies to achieve greater scale, to be more competitive and expand into new export markets.  The objective of the &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; strategy is to support enterprises across the economy, to grow into strong Irish international companies, developing world-leading products and services and exporting them all around the world.</p><p>There is a vast range of programmes and supports offered to companies across the country to drive this strategy.  These include management capability, leadership and marketing/sales skills as well as promoting innovation and R&amp;amp;D.</p><p>IDA Ireland reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016.  199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, which is the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history.</p><p>Since 2015 IDA Ireland has been working towards targets set out in their strategy &ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo; including the creation of 80,000 new jobs and 900 new investments, which would bring total FDI employment in Ireland to 209,000 by 2019.  The Agency is also aiming to increase the level of investment by between 30% and 40% in each region.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to countrywide job creation is further illustrated by the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  This has seen eight plans published throughout 2015 and 2016, which identified a range of actions aimed at supporting each region to achieve its economic potential and raise employment levels. </p><p>As part of this initiative, IDA Ireland is investing &euro;150 million over five years in property solutions designed to allow it to create opportunities to win additional projects for all regions.  This includes include the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country.  This is a positive development for attracting FDI into regional locations.</p><p>These new regional initiatives are already producing results.  The numbers in employment increased in all regions during 2016 with 70% of new jobs created outside Dublin.  The fastest growing regions in terms of employment during 2016 were the Mid West (up 7.4%), the West (up 5.5%), and the South East (up 4.6%).</p><p>I am currently finalising plans for a Competitive Regional Funding Initiative of up to &euro;60m to support collaborative approaches to grow and sustain indigenous enterprise and jobs across the regions.  This will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p></reply>

The WRC merges the functions and activities of the former Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the Labour Court. Â The Equality Tribunal was dissolved on the vesting day of the WRC. </p>  <p>  With regard to the statistics on appeals published in the WRC&rsquo;s 2016 Annual Report, and given the time period involved following the establishment of the WRC, the overall numbers of appeals to the Court are low.  Having regard to that, some 90 per cent of Adjudication decisions were accepted by the parties and were not appealed.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the WRC Annual Report, the position is that in relation to the decisions issued by the Labour Court in appeals on cases where the original complaint was made after 1 October 2015, of these, 47 per cent were upheld, 20 per cent were overturned and 31 per cent of those appealed were varied, mostly in relation to the quantum of the award. Â Two appeals were deemed to be outside the time-limits.Â  </p>  <p>  In terms of the Deputy&rsquo;s question the proportion of decisions on appeals overturned by the Labour Court is one-fifth.  In the nine months prior to the establishment of the WRC, 16 per cent of the appeals to the Labour Court taken in relation to Equality Tribunal decisions and heard by the Labour Court, were overturned.  This does not appear to be statistically significant at this stage; particularly in light of the low overall number under consideration.</p>  <p>  The WRC will monitor and report on these outcomes annually.</p></reply>

Â Membership includes the main retail representative bodies, retailers themselves and representatives from relevant Government Departments and public bodies.</p>  <p>  One of the most immediate concerns currently facing the Sector is the impact of Brexit and how this might influence consumer decisions.Â  I am also keenly aware of the concerns about the uncertainty surrounding border arrangements that will be in place post-Brexit, and the concerns on the depreciation of sterling.Â  In recognition of these matters, Brexit has become a standing item on the agenda for discussion by the Retail Consultation Forum.Â  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting the retail sector during this period of heightened uncertainty and is working with retailers on a pilot study into the firm-level impact for enterprise of Brexit.Â  The outcome of this study, together with the outcome of a number of additional stakeholder engagements with businesses, including retailers, will assist the Government in informing our position during the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have established a Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Enterprise Forum on Brexit and global challenges.  This will provide a vehicle for discussion of enterprise, trade and investment policy implications arising from wider global challenges, with a specific focus on Brexit in the first instance.  The work of this Forum will help inform me on the development of DJEI, and ultimately Government policy positions on enterprise, trade and investment, to be taken during Brexit negotiations. </p>  <p>  A number of other relevant pieces of work are underway.  My officials are currently finalising the outputs from a series of structured engagements with companies of different sizes, across different sectors and across the regions on the impact of currency fluctuations on exposed companies.  The information gathered during the course of this engagement is detailed and informative and will give me a clear indication of the needs of SMEs to help them address the short and more medium and long term challenges of Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a research project being undertaken in close cooperation with InterTrade Ireland by the ESRI to improve our understanding of the impact on cross border trade of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is also providing InterTrade Ireland with additional funding this year to undertake a range of initiatives for SMEs in the Republic of Ireland to help them adapt to the changed circumstances following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  This will involve the provision of factual advice, supports for capability building and the provision of other specialist expertise for companies.Â  </p>  <p>  Through my Chairmanship of the Retail Consultation Forum, the sector is provided with a direct line of contact with Government in which to raise all of their concerns, including the impact of the referendum in the UK, and to work collaboratively towards practical solutions.Â Â As the Retail Consultation Forum provides a platform in which to raise these concerns, and the members have and will continue to be updated by my officials with reference to relevant developments of my Department&rsquo;s Brexit undertakings, there are no plans to establish a separate north south forum.</p></reply>

As part of a broad suite of programmes the agency is responsible for driving an increase in the innovative capacity of Irish firms as well as support for start-up businesses.</p><p>In 2016 Enterprise Ireland paid &euro;31.5 million to pre-High Potential Start Ups and High Potential Start Ups (HPSUs). Â This comprised &euro;27.5 million in equity payments and &euro;4 million in grants payments. 295 companies received equity payments and 193 grant payments.</p><p>New start-ups play a critical role in net new job creation in all advanced economies.Â  Ireland, by promoting the right combination of supports and business environment, can become the best small country in the world in which to start a business. Â The World Bank Doing Business &ndash; Starting a Business Survey (2017) currently ranks Ireland as 10th out of 137 countries for its business environment and supports.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist clients through all stages of the business development cycle.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s start-up activity is focused on prospecting for and supporting High Potential Start-Ups.  HPSU companies are defined as start-up ventures that are:</p><p>- Introducing a new or innovative product or service to international markets.</p><p>- Involved in manufacturing or internationally traded services.</p><p>- Capable of creating 10 jobs in Ireland and realising &euro;1 million in sales within three to four years of starting up.</p><p>- Led by an experienced management team.</p><p>- Headquartered and controlled in Ireland.</p><p>- Less than six years old.</p><p>Start-up companies that have a well-developed business plan and meet the criteria of a HPSU can apply to Enterprise Ireland for equity support under the following two competitive funds:</p><p>- Competitive Start Fund: A &euro;50k equity investment designed to accelerate the development of high potential start-up companies by supporting them to achieve commercial and technical milestones, such as evaluating international market opportunities or building a prototype.</p><p>- Innovative HPSU Fund: The Innovative HPSU Fund allows Enterprise Ireland to offer equity investment to HPSU clients, on a co-funded basis to support the implementation of a company&rsquo;s business plans.  First time and follow-on equity investments in HPSUs are supported under this offer.</p><p>In addition, pre-HPSU and HPSU companies can avail of Enterprise Ireland grant supports in the form of Innovation Vouchers, a Mentor Grant, a Business Links Grant and Competitive Feasibility Funding.  As part of their developmental plans, these companies can also participate in capabilities-building events and programmes such as, Enterprise Excel at Selling and HPSU Founders Forum.</p><p>Over the period 2014 -2016, Enterprise Ireland supported a total of 308 High Potential Start-ups and 321 Competitive Start Funds.  Of the total 629 start-ups supported by Enterprise Ireland from 2014 - 2016, 52% were located outside Dublin. </p></reply>

To this end an inter-Departmental Task Force was formed by the Government.</p>  <p>  The report of the Government&rsquo;s Task Force on Non-EEA Workers in the Irish Fishing Industry recommended the establishment of a sector-specific Atypical Worker Permission system which is an extension of the existing Atypical Worker Permission schemes administered by the Department of Justice and Equality (Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service &ndash; INIS).  The purpose of this scheme is to provide a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish commercial sea-fishing fleet.  This system was established and is operated through the co-operative efforts of myÂ colleagues the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister Agriculture, Food and the Marine and my Department.Â Â </p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of this scheme, 11 Departments or Agencies were brought together under the aegis of my Department and developed a 'Memorandum of Understanding for the Monitoring and Enforcement of the terms of Employment of non &ndash;EEA crewmen in parts of the Irish Commercial Sea Fishing Fleet pursuant to the establishment of the Atypical Worker Permission scheme'.  Up to that point inspections on vessels were carried out primarily by the Marine Survey Office and the Health and Safety Authority.  Inspectors of the Workplace Relations Commission, based on newly acquired powers were trained and equipped, with support from a number of marine agencies, to board vessels and carry out their own inspections.  In the period 1st June, 2016 to 1st April, 2017 the WRC had inspected 80% of the fleet that comes within the aegis of the Atypical Worker PermissionÂ Scheme.  I am informed the WRC objective is to inspect the remainder by Summer 2017.</p>  <p>  TheÂ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine established and hosts a Central Depository, the purpose of which is to register the eligible contracts and supporting documentation required under the Scheme and to ensure that the ceiling of 500 contracts is not exceeded in any 12 month period.Â  The Department of Justice and Equality retains responsibility for immigration matters under the scheme while the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) put in place and led by myÂ Department with relevant State enforcement bodies provides for a rigorous and effective inspection system. </p>  <p>  The scheme is a relatively recent initiative and I am not aware of any plans to replace it.</p></reply>

The allocation in 2017 is &euro;14.4m. </p>  <p>  The 2017 PRTLI allocation is being used to address the existing liabilities underÂ PRTLI Cycle 5.  There were 33 projects funded under Cycle 5, of these 29Â are now complete and the remaining 4Â are expected toÂ reach completion by the middle of this year with final reports and expenditure declarations expected before year end.

PRTLI-funded infrastructure and consortia have been a key attractor of matching funds from private (non-exchequer) sources.  Over the course of the five Cycles to date PRTLI projects have attracted over &euro;277m in co-funding. Â I am keen to ensure that any successor to PRTLI Cycle 5 will also facilitate the HEIs to continue to leverage investment from other sources. </p>  <p>  The planning and design of a successor to Cycle 5 of PRTLI is an action in Innovation 2020 and is being progressed by my Department working closely with the Department of Education and Skills.Â  My Department has included a proposal to commence funding for a successor to Cycle 5 of the PRTLI in its submission to the Mid-term Review of the Capital Plan. Â There will be more clarity on a successor to Cycle 5 when this review is concluded, and the funding envelope for this and other projects is finalised.</p></reply>

It is enabling the Department and, primarily, our Agencies recruit some 40 to 50 additional staff to supplement existing staffing numbers.Â  These numbers may grow as Agencies allocate additional Own Resource Income, by agreement with the Department, to recruit further staff to work on &quot;Brexit-related&quot; activity.</p><p>The additional &euro;3m has been allocated across:</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland</p><p>- IDA Ireland</p><p>- Science Foundation Ireland</p><p>- The Health and Safety Authority, andÂ </p><p>- The Department itself (&euro;250,000) </p><p>The Department as a whole (currently 861 staff or 813 Full-Time Equivalents) has prioritised the Brexit challenges in its work plans for 2017 across all its Divisions.  Brexit Unit staffing has been set at a team of 4 staff for now as follows: 1 Principal, 1 Assistant Principal, 1 Higher Executive Officer and 1 Clerical Officer.Â  In addition, the work of very many Business Units across the Department is impacted by Brexit.Â  These Units have finalised their business plans for 2017 and the impact of Brexit for their work has been fully factored in.Â  In addition, a workforce planning process spanning the years 2017-19 has recently been concluded.  This process was coordinated by my Department's HR Unit and reviewed the level of resources assigned across all Divisions of the Department in relation to our current strategic priorities, and, naturally, responding to Brexit features heavily in the plan.  In this regard additional staffing resources will be recruited to support the Brexit Unit and other areas of the Department impacted by Brexit in the immediate period ahead. </p><p>In terms of the Agency numbers, additional Brexit resources are being put in place in response to the &euro;2.750m allocated for extra staff.  This sum is anticipated to allow for additional Brexit staffing in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, SFI and the HSA (with a number of specific posts sanctioned and recruitment under way). </p><p>In relation to Enterprise Ireland, my Department has sanctioned an additional 39 posts withÂ the AgencyÂ supplementing the &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; pay allocation with additional Own Resource Income.  12 of the 39 posts have been filled.  The remaining 27 are actively being sourced through recruitment processes.  </p><p>IDA Ireland has sought 21 additional staff resources in order that it can meet the jobs and investment targets set out in its Strategy &ndash; &ldquo;Winning Foreign Direct Investment 2015 &ndash; 2019&rdquo; - and to meet the global challenges of 2017 and beyond with Brexit key among the identified challenges.Â  The Agency also submitted a staff resourcing strategy to the Department in July 2016 which sought sanction for retention of the 35 staff hired on 3-year fixed term contracts under the Winning Abroad Programme.Â  This request is still under consideration.  The Department has recently approved IDA's request to reinstate its Graduate Recruitment Programme on a three year contract basis and will commence the recruitment process shortly.Â  In addition, IDA has received official sanction to recruit 10 additional &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo; staff members.  One of the Brexit staff members has been recruited and recruitment is underway for the remaining positions. </p><p>Science Foundation Ireland will be hiring an additional 3 staff in 2017 who will have Brexit related responsibilities as part of their portfolios</p><p>In relation to the Health and Safety Authority, the Department has recently formally sanctioned an additional Assistant Principal post which is one of the two posts identified as &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; related for that body.  Formal approval for the second post, for a Grade III Inspector, is currently awaited.  The HSA will commence recruitment to fill the AP post in the near future.  </p><p>Finally, in respect of these Agencies, they all have prioritised the Brexit implications arising for them in their individual work plans for 2017 and beyond which serving staff will contribute to as part of their day-to-day work.  In this regard the staffing of these Agencies is set out below:</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland had 575 staff in 564 Full-Time Equivalent posts before Brexit-specific recruitment of upwards of 39 staff takes effect.</p><p>- IDA had 268 staff in 259 Full-Time Equivalent posts before Brexit-specific recruitment of upwards of 21 staff takes effect.</p><p>- SFI had 47 staff in 46.5 Full-Time Equivalent posts before Brexit-specific recruitment of 2 additional staff takes effect.</p><p>- HSA has 167 staff in 159 Full-Time Equivalent posts before Brexit-specific recruitment of 2 additional staff takes effect.</p></reply>

Â In 2016, 52% of all Agency supported jobs created were based outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  While IDA Ireland does everything in its power to ensure an even spread of investments, it is important to realise that the ultimate decision on location rests solely with the company.  There is a global trend to base foreign direct investment around large urban areas.  Quite often, companies also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises.  As a result, some businesses are only interested in investing in our larger cities.Â  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving balanced regional development and this ambition is reflected in our eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJs). Â  The aim of the RAPJsÂ is to ensure that the unemployment rate of each region is within one percentage point of the State average by 2020.Â   These plans are delivering clear results with an implementation rate of over 90% for each region.Â  Â </p></reply>

The SBIR process facilitates competitions which enable public sector bodies to connect with innovation-led businesses to work on innovative ideas which tackle challenges facing the public sector leading to better public services and improved effectiveness and value for money.</p>  <p>  The call, ICT-33-2017 Innovation Procurement Networks, is a Coordination and Support Action designed to address the fragmentation of public demand by facilitating cross-border cooperation among procurers.  One objective is the creation of an EU-wide network of national competence centres on innovation procurement to promote the PCP and PPI programmes. The centres should assist ICT procurers in participating in PCP and PPI and share expertise across the EU.</p>  <p>  In  relation to the specific project referred to by the Deputy, I have been advised  by the Office of Government Procurement that they have been notified that an  application to participate in the Networks was submitted by the consortium to the European CommissionÂ by the 25 April 2017Â closing  deadline.</p></reply>

Â These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be important for Ireland. Â With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World which supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification - promoting diversified export markets is a key priority for my Department. Â This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.Â  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.Â  In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets, including an increased focus on EU markets. Â Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focussing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.</p>  <p>  The EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement has led to a sizeable increase in Irish exports since it came into effect in 2011.Â  This is the real evidence that Trade Agreements work for Irish exporters and Irish jobs.</p>  <p>  Beef is considered as a sensitive agricultural product in EU free trade agreements where only limited concessions are granted in the form of tariff rate quotas. Â Any import of beef is subject to full compliance with EU health and safety standards including the ban on hormone treated beef. Â This means that only hormone-free meat can be imported into the EU. Â During the EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement negotiations Ireland successfully campaigned for the EU to grant Canada a low beef tariff rate quota of 45,850 tonnes progressively over 5 years thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area. Â Above this agreed quota the EU's high tariffs continue to apply.Â  I will continue to work at securing the best deal for Ireland in any future trade negotiation, bearing in mind our defensive interests, in sensitive areas such as the beef sector.</p></reply>

Â The fact that over 130,000 of those 201,000 jobs are outside of Dublin is also significant. Â All regions recorded increases in employment.</p><p>Over the period of its 2014-2016 Strategy &lsquo;Driving Enterprise, Delivering Jobs&rsquo;, EI exceeded its 45,000 jobs target, and 45,592 new full time jobs were created by client companies.  The Strategy has driven the greatest job creation ever achieved in any three year period by Irish companies.</p><p>EI&rsquo;s new &lsquo;Global Ambition&rsquo; strategy 2017-2020 will support enterprises across the economy, to grow into strong Irish international companies, developing world-leading products and services and exporting them all around the world.  The strategy builds on the success of recent years and sets new ambitious targets for jobs growth of 60,000 and to increase exports by &euro;5 billion per year, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.</p><p>IDA Ireland reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016. Â 199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, up from 188,035 in 2015. Â This is the highest level of employment in IDA Ireland client companies in the Agency's 68-year history.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2015-2019 includes a commitment to increase foreign FDI in every region outside Dublin by 30%-40%.Â  The Agency made good progress towards achieving this goal in 2016, with 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland's clients last year based outside of Dublin.Â  The Agency is targeting the creation of 7,000 net new jobs and 180 new investments in 2017.</p><p><b>Table 1</b>below providesÂ a breakdown of new jobs created in Enterprise Ireland supported companies by county for 2015 and 2016.</p><p><b>Table 2</b>providesÂ a breakdown of new jobs created in IDA Ireland supported companies by county for the same period.Agency job figures are collated on an annual basis only, therefore figures for 2017 will not be available until the Annual Employment Survey is released at the beginning of 2018.</p><p><b>Table 1</b>: New Jobs (Permanent Full time and Other) created by Enterprise Ireland supported Companies<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>234</td><td>373</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>487</td><td>466</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>235</td><td>282</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>2,712</td><td>2,154</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>534</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>8,062</td><td>7,579</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>999</td><td>836</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>556</td><td>272</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>981</td><td>711</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>342</td><td>348</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>131</td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>97</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>485</td><td>1,158</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>267</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>566</td><td>535</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>206</td><td>273</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>702</td><td>550</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>467</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>452</td><td>277</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>180</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>115</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>518</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>693</td><td>397</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>229</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>465</td><td>214</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>403</td><td>440</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td>21,118</td><td>19,244</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2</b>: New Jobs (Permanent Full time and Other) created by IDA supported Companies<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>19</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>29</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>530</td><td>295</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>4,535</td><td>2,602</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>330</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>10,202</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>1,457</td><td>1,896</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>89</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>849</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>9</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>18</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>16</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>950</td><td>1,634</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>46</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>317</td><td>453</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>159</td><td>181</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>67</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>52</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>58</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>108</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>166</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary North Riding</td><td>25</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary South Riding</td><td>70</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>523</td><td>697</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>212</td><td>185</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>101</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>45</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>20,982</td><td>18,627</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scope of the Commission&rsquo;s investigation includes several specific areas of practice and procedure in the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for the women and children who were residents of 14 named institutions and the representative sample of County Homes identified by the Commission.  With regard to the investigation of burial grounds associated with these homes, this is a matter for the Commission to decide and progress in accordance with its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Second Interim Report noted that its existing terms of reference are very wide and it did not recommend any changes.

Guardians <i>ad litem</i>perform a very important function in these proceedings both as a support for the children and young people involved and as an invaluable source of advice to the Courts in determining the best course of action in relation to the child&rsquo;s care and welfare.</p><p>The reform proposals I am bringing forward will address significant inadequacies in the existing arrangements and will replace the existing ad hoc system with a high quality, child-centred, cost effective national service.  Most importantly, it will extend the Guardian <i>ad litem</i>system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people.</p><p>In January, I published a General Scheme of a Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2017, as approved by Government.  The General Scheme inter alia provides for a presumption in favour of a Guardian ad litem for all children in child care proceedings and that the Guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be independent in the exercise of his or her functions.  These proposed functions are twofold i.e. to inform the court of the child's views and to advise the court on what is in the best interests of the child, having considered the views of the child.  Under the new legislation, the Guardian <i>ad litem</i>will be required to promote and facilitate the child's right to a voice and to have his or her views heard in the proceedings and to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</p><p>The General Scheme is currently being considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and I look forward to their comments and observations on the General Scheme in the near future, including the proposed role and function of the Guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Subject to the outcome of this examination, I intend to publish the text of a Bill as soon as possible in the second half of this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.3823.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200138#WRCCC02500"><p>As I announced on 12 April, a number of significant changes will be made to the existing targeted childcare schemes this September, including an increase of up to 50% in subsidy-rates.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted schemes, will be introduced at a later date, when it is fully ready for operation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the potential impact of the rules proposed for the Affordable Childcare Scheme, in particular the rule limiting childcare subsidies to 15 hours per week for families where a parent is not engaged in any form of work or training.  This rule reflects a balance between the scheme&rsquo;s objectives of supporting child development and supporting labour market participation for families with low incomes, and thereby contributing to the reduction of child poverty.</p>  <p>  In determining the rules for the scheme, I want to ensure a balanced approach to eligibility: while people will qualify for a subsidy based purely on income, parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available.  When parents are engaged in work (including even small amounts of part-time work or participation in labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced hours subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will nevertheless be subsidised on a standard hours basis of up to 15 hours per week, reflecting the benefits for all children of part-time participation in childcare.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach.</p>  <p>  It will mean that the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who stay at home to care for their children, and are not taking part in any work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school-going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours childcare will apply only to non-term time.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that I intend to take a very inclusive approach in defining &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;study&rdquo; for the purpose of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  As a consequence, many social welfare recipients will benefit from the enhanced hours subsidy (i.e. up to 40 hours per week), as many social welfare payments allow a parent to work part-time, for a certain number of hours or days per week.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that where a parent is at home and not engaged in any work or study, the family will not benefit from subsidised after-school childcare during term-times, because of the 15-hour limit.  However, I believe it is right that the Scheme should actively support labour market participation through linking the number of hours of subsidy to a family&rsquo;s need for childcare for the purpose of work, education or training.  Supporting labour market participation for low-income families is an essential part of our efforts to reduce child poverty.</p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support, and where there is a referral by Tusla.  For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, it is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income or work/study test.  Tusla would recommend the hours of childcare needed.  The scheme would then provide the maximum rate of subsidy in respect of those hours of care, and no payment would be asked of the parents in these circumstances.  This approach is consistent with current practice under CCS and is critical to supporting strong child welfare and protection practices.  My officials are currently in discussion with Tusla in relation to the way in which this referral process will operate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

My Department continues to work closely with the CCCs to match this data against reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  My Department is also working with the CCCs on the development of action plans for areas where a shortfall in supply may be identified.</p><p>In relation to the Clonskeagh area specifically, I understand that there are three Private creches and no Community creches currently in operation in the area.  I can confirm that my Department has not received any reports that these creche services are insufficient to meet current requirements in the Clonskeagh area.  Officials from my department also contacted Pobal and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Childcare Committee and they confirmed that they are not aware of any particular demographic issues within the Clonskeagh area.  However, if the Deputy has information which suggests that this is not the case perhaps this could be provided and my Department will consider the matter further.</p><p>It should also be noted that although there is no community services in the area, private childcare providers can avail of the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) programme and therefore provide parents and children with access to subsidised childcare.</p><p>In addition I recently announced a separate <font color="#222222">&euro;</font>3 million in capital funding for services providing school age childcare.  This capital scheme will encourage expansion in the number of school age childcare places along with enhancements to quality.

I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party.</p>  <p>  At the end of February 2017 (the latest data available), there was a total of 25,387 open child welfare and protection cases nationwide.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of the 25,387 open cases, 77% (19,667) had an allocated social worker and 5,720 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of the children awaiting allocation to a social worker at the end of February, 1,057 were high priority.</p>  <p>  Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker.</p>  <p>  It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  Tusla currently has 1,480 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I attach a high priority to tackling this matter and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team, over the course of the year, to review progress.</p></reply>

Throughout the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection have worked closely with my Department to ensure the new Scheme will have full and efficient access to income information.  Officials of my Department have at all times received a high level of cooperation and support from both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of all that is involved - legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new IT system.  Since the policy paper for the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme was approved by Government in October 2016, officials of the DCYA and Pobal have been working intensively to plan for the implementation of this Scheme.</p>  <p>  I recently announced that a number of changes will be made to existing childcare schemes that will bring substantial benefits to an estimated 70,000 children and their families from this September.  These changes will include a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged from 6 months up to 36 months old (or commencement of the free pre-school programme).  It is estimated that this new universal childcare subsidy may benefit approximately 33,000 children and their families.  For children in full-time, registered childcare, the subsidy will amount to approximately &euro;1,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  In addition, there will be significant increases of up to 50 percent in childcare subvention rates provided under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years old.  It is estimated that up to 37,000 children and their families may benefit from targeted subsidies from this September.  A large proportion of these will see an increase in their weekly subsidy.  For example, parents availing of full-time childcare who currently have their childcare costs subsidised by &euro;95 per week under the Community Childcare Subvention will see their subvention rate rise to &euro;145 per week.  Thousands of children and their families are expected to benefit from targeted supports for the first time from September due to improved access to existing schemes through a greater number of childcare providers throughout the country.  These children and their families too will benefit from these generous increases in childcare subvention rates.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will be introduced at the earliest possible date, while ensuring that the scheme is fully operational and user-friendly for all concerned.  When it is introduced, additional families who are not eligible for current schemes but who then meet ACS income criteria will also benefit from subsidies. Given the considerable uncertainty about the impact of the new scheme on parental demand for childcare, the number of additional beneficiaries at that stage cannot be determined with any precision. However, it is estimated that the total number of beneficiaries in the first year of the Affordable Childcare Scheme may be approximately 79,000 and that the number is likely to continue to rise over time in response to parental demand.</p></reply>

The programme was then expanded beginning in September 2016 by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3.  The upper age limit for the free pre-school programme is set at 5 years and 6 months, meaning that if a child is going to be older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of a pre-school year (i.e. end of June) they are not eligible to avail of free pre-school in that year.  This upper age limit was set in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills to limit the age range of children beginning primary school and to ensure that children transition into primary school with their peers.</p>  <p>  As this child was born in December 2011 he will be older than 5 years and 6 months by the end of June and, therefore, was not eligible for the free pre-school for the 2016/17 year.</p></reply>

The Court may seek a range of reports or the assistance of a Guardian <i>ad litem</i>before coming to a decision.

The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 was signed into law in December 2015.  It entitles eligible young people to a formal aftercare plan, prepared by Tusla in collaboration with the young person leaving care.  In response to this legislation Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  It has developed dedicated aftercare teams, standardised financial supports it offers to those leaving care, and continues to develop inter-agency steering committees to strongly promote co-ordination of these services at local level.  Through these measures, young people leaving care are offered a wide range of services from different sectors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education.</p><p>Of the 602 young adults discharged from care by reason of reaching 18 years of age during 2016, 581 (or 97%) were eligible for an aftercare service.  Of these, 521 (90%) availed of the aftercare service.  It should be noted that engagement with Tusla in relation to aftercare is on a voluntary basis.  Tusla has no power to oblige a young person to avail of the support offered.  In all 1,389 young adults aged 18 to 20 inclusive were in receipt of an aftercare service at the end of the year.  Of these, 803 (58%) were in full time education while a further 442 (32%) were receiving education or training outside of full time education. </p><p>In addition to the aftercare planning and supports provided by Tusla, <i>Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness </i>commits to ensuring that young people leaving State care who are at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports.</p><p>Funding is now in place under the capital assistance scheme (CAS) enabling approved housing bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate young people exiting State care.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is collaborating with Tusla on the development of principles and criteria relating to funding proposals.  Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan.  Tusla has also redistributed its protocol on young people leaving State care to housing authorities.  The aim of this protocol is to ensure that the necessary measures are in place to prevent homelessness for young people leaving State care.</p></reply>

Since then, officials of my Department and Pobal have been working intensively to plan for the implementation of this scheme.</p><p>This is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of all that is involved &ndash; legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new IT system.  We will need to integrate data from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so that the system can calculate every family&rsquo;s net income and affordable child care scheme subsidy.  We will need to test the IT system rigorously to make sure it works, even in complicated family circumstances. </p><p>While my officials are working as quickly as possible, I believe it is prudent to take the time to ensure we get the new systems right so that they operate smoothly for everyone.  I am therefore reluctant to commit to a definite delivery date at this stage. The affordable child care scheme will be introduced at the earliest possible date, while ensuring that the scheme is fully operational and user-friendly for all concerned.</p><p>However, I do not want to delay the benefit of higher child care subsidies for low-income families.  For that reason, I recently announced that a number of changes will be made to existing child care schemes that will bring substantial benefits to an estimated 70,000 children and their families from this September.  These changes will include a new universal subsidy for children aged from 6 months up to 36 months old (or commencement of the free pre-school programme) and significant increases of up to 50 per cent in targeted child care subvention rates provided under the community child care subvention scheme for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years old . For example, parents availing of full-time child care who currently have their child care costs subsidised by &euro;95 per week under the community childcare subvention &ndash; which is the largest of the targeted childcare schemes &ndash; will see their subvention rate rise to &euro;145 per week from this September.</p></reply>

It was awarded to persons who were awarded 1916 military service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, or to those who did not apply for a pension but who satisfied the Minister that they would have been awarded 1916 military service if they had applied under the Acts.  In relation to the case in question, the board of assessors (comprised of senior old IRA officers and chaired by a judge) appointed under Section 3(1) of the Military Service Pensions Act 1924 (the 1924 Act), examined the application of the person in question for the purpose of making a report to the Minister for Defence as to the military service of the applicant.  The board reported its findings to the Minister for Defence and on foot of that report the Minister decided on 4 January 1927 that a certificate of military service could be granted in respect the period 1 April 1920 to 30 September 1923 (including service in the National Army) but not in respect of the 1916 period.  An appeal was made to the then Minister for Defence in 1928 to have the case re-opened but this appeal was unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  In 1942 the person in question applied for a 1916 Medal but it was found that while he had a certificate of military service under the 1924 Act it did not cover the relevant period in 1916.  The person in question was, however, awarded the Service Medal (1917-1921) with bar, in respect of his service.</p>  <p>  The power given to the board of assessors in Section 3(6) of the 1924 Act to re-open any or all of their findings (as amended by Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act 1930) was removed by the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act 1949.  Under the 1949 Act applications under the 1924 Act could only be re-examined where the Minister had refused to issue a certificate of military service to an applicant; however, the applicant in question was issued with such a certificate in 1927.</p>  <p>  The matter has been examined and investigated by senior officials on a significant number of occasions on foot of representations received but in the absence of any statutory powers it is not possible, nor would I consider it appropriate, to reopen the findings of the board of assessors.  The board of assessors was required under Section 3(2) of the 1924 Act to &ldquo;examine all applications...make such enquiries, summon all such witnesses, and take all such evidence whether on oath or otherwise&rdquo;.  As the Deputy will appreciate the person in question and all members of the Old IRA and witnesses to the events of 1916 are deceased.</p>  <p>  The approach to assessment of military service was an extremely comprehensive one with an appeals mechanism by which individual cases could be re-opened and any additional evidence provided.  It would not be possible over one hundred years after the time in question, and many decades since these processes concluded, to improve on this work which is now a matter of history, although I recognise that it is very important history and of keen concern to the relations of those involved.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to bring forward any legislative proposals in relation to the matter.</p></reply>

In relation to such requests, it has been settled policy for many years that replacement medals were issued on a once-off only basis on receipt of a bona fide request from the veteran to whom the original medals were awarded.  This policy was adopted in the interest of preserving the intrinsic value of the medals and to strictly limit the number of medals issued in any particular case.  Although all of the Veterans are now deceased, the rationale for restricting the issue of replacement medals is still valid.  Apart from the intrinsic value of the medals, their monetary value on the open market is also a factor.  In 2006, the then Minister for Defence decided that, where 1916 Rising/War of Independence medals had been lost, stolen or destroyed, official certificates, in both Irish and English, would be issued in such cases confirming that the relevant medal(s) was/were awarded to the named Veteran.  The procedure in such cases is that the family can obtain an application form from the Pensions Administration Section of the Department of Defence in &Aacute;ras an tS&aacute;ile, Renmore, Galway (telephone 091 743899 or email &ndash; <i>pensions.admin@defence.ie</i>). Once the form is completed and returned to the Department, the details will be verified by the Department and, if in order, the relevant certificate/s will be issued (generally to the next of kin) on a once-off basis.</p></reply>

The current total strength for the Reserve Defence Force (as of 28 February 2017) is 1,970 effective personnel and subhead A5 provides for a budget &euro;2.115 million for paid training.

This is underlined by a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the level of female participation in the Defence Forces.  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:</p><p>-  The Defence Forces have visited many female schools to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women.</p><p>-  The Defence Forces have targeted female sports clubs to heighten awareness of the opportunities for women in the Defence Forces.</p><p>-  Female websites have been targeted as part of the recruitment campaigns.</p><p>-Special consideration is paid to women asa target group for recruitment.</p><p>-  There is a representative composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards.</p><p>-A Gender Advisor operates to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.</p><p>The 2016 General Service Campaign specifically targeted female applications through a number of new initiatives including the use of a campaign video which was shown across all social media platforms and in cinemas.  Additionally, all female candidates were invited to their local barracks for a female fitness andÂ information evening. </p><p>Some 680 (or 15%) of the applications received during the 2016 General Service Campaign were from females.  A total of 47 females were inducted into the Defence Forces in 2016, representing 6.81% of the overall intake.  These initiatives will continue for 2017.  Unlike some other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions with regard to the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas. </p><p>Notwithstanding these recent proactive initiatives, I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies over the life span of the White Paper that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces.  Specific White Paper projects in this area include:</p><p>-  Developing further initiatives to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks.</p><p>-  Conducting a survey to identify any impediments to the advancement of women in the PDF.</p><p>-  Developing and actively managing a Diversity and Inclusion Strategy in the Defence Forces, building on existing policies in relation to ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and equality.</p><p>-  Reviewing operational requirements, overseas postings, training courses, career courses and the availability of development opportunities, to ensure that they do not discriminate on the basis of gender or familial responsibility, while retaining the integrity of the course and training requirement.</p></reply>

A successful pilot programme was held in Gormanston Camp from 20 June 2016 to 26 August 2016 with 25 participants.  Following an evaluation of the pilot programme and Ministerial approval, the current plan is to run 2 iterations of the programme in 2017.  The objective of this 10-week scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose.  The plan is to run two iterations of the programme in 2017.</p>  <p>  The first iteration of the programme will commence in Limerick on 22 May 2017. There are 30 places on the programme and the selection process is ongoing.  Participants retain any Department of Social Protection benefits that they are currently entitled to for the duration of the Scheme.  Participation on the scheme is wholly voluntary for the relevant cohort of jobseekers and there is no penalty applied for non-participation or engagement in the programme.  Participants do not receive any payment from the Department of Defence.</p>  <p>  With regard to general employment opportunities in the Defence Forces, the Defence Forces are planning to induct 860 new entrants across all services and competition streams in 2017.  Recruitment will continue in 2017 from the panels formed following the 2016 General Service Recruitment competition, until they are exhausted.  In addition, a new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces at 9,500 personnel.  A recruitment campaign for apprentices will be launched later this year.</p>  <p>  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  The 2017 Cadetship competitions were launched on 22 March 2017.  Cadetships will be available in the following streams in 2017: Army (Line, Equitation School &amp;amp; Engineer Corps), Naval Service (Operations Branch, Marine Engineer Branch and Electrical Engineering Branch) and Air Corps (Pilots).Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  A recruitment campaign for the appointment of Direct Entry Naval Service Officers, in the Operations Branch, Marine Engineer Branch and Electrical Engineer Branch of the Naval Service, is currently ongoing.  In addition, there is an open ended recruitment drive to recruit Medical Officers to the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made.  Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  The issue of the award of medals to the men of "A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965.  A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision.  The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.</p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case.  This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition.  In this context, a plaque was unveiled in November 2005 in Custume Barracks Athlone to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.  There was also a range of actions which further recognised their contribution over subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In September 2016, on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. During the ceremony I presented a copy of the Citation to each member of the Unit or next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.  This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to issue military medals to members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Coy 35th Infantry Battalion.  However, a further review of archival records is currently being undertaken by the military authorities.  This will assist in informing any decisions regarding further recognition.</p></reply>

The Coast Guard search and rescue services can request the support of the Air Corps on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis under a Service Level Agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013. Availability is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews and the suitability of weather conditions.

Indeed, the WRC will not publish details of any individual case or the identity of any applicant.  As regards the procedures in place within the Defence Forces to deal with bullying I would like to reiterate that it is Defence Forces policy that all personnel have a right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment.  While military life entails robust and effective military training, such training must, however, take place in a professional service environment that fully respects individual human dignity. Bullying and harassment of any kind are wrong and are not tolerated within the Defence Forces.  They are entirely unacceptable in themselves and wholly incompatible with a successful and modern organisation.</p>  <p>  All known incidents of such behaviour are properly investigated bearing in mind the need for due process which requires fairness to all parties to the complaint.  Through the induction process and general notifications, the non-tolerance of unacceptable behaviour is stressed to all members of the Defence Forces.  The formal and informal procedures in force are there to encourage any individual who wishes to make a complaint.  Procedures for dealing with complaints of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment are set out in Defence Forces Regulations.  Complaints of unacceptable behaviour can be dealt with at different levels, either in an informal approach or formal manner.  The overall aim is to ensure that the complaint is dealt with, in the first instance, at the lowest level possible. Informal complaints can be resolved directly by the complainant with the assistance of a third party if required.  Such third party can include any member of the Defence Forces who has the trust and confidence of the complainant.  Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are also available to assist complainants.</p>  <p>  The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing.  These are dealt with by the military chain of command either through the legal/disciplinary process or by administrative action.</p></reply>

A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.</p><p>The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army, as a General Service Recruit, is under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment.</p><p>The upper age limit governing the awarding of Cadetships in the Permanent Defence Force for the 2017 competitions, is under 28 years of age on 1 September 2017.  Following a review this upper age limit will be reduced on a phased basis to &ldquo;under 27 years of age&rdquo; for the 2018 Cadetship competitions and to &ldquo;under 26 years of age&rdquo; for the 2019 Cadetship competitions.</p><p>As these age requirements, in accordance with Defence Force Regulations, are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual cases.</p><p>These limits have been determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force require that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-02a.3973.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017050200140#WREEE03900"><p>In accordance with Defence Forces Regulation A10, a General Service applicant for the Naval Service must be under 27 years of age on the closing date for receipt of applications.  As the individual referred to by the Deputy is 28 years of age he is above the age limit to apply to join the Permanent Defence Force (PDF),Â irrespective of previous service.  Age limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the PDF requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation as a whole.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have an ongoing objective of ensuring an appropriate age profile through continuous recruitment and congruent manpower planning, training and development and career management strategies.  Given the health and fitness requirements for Privates and recruits to the Defence Forces, I do not believe that it would serve the Defence Forces or the individual recruits well to increase the current age limits.</p>  <p>  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that the upper age limit for recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) under Defence Forces Regulation R5 is 35 years of age.  Additionally, the age limit for former members of the PDF with at least one year&rsquo;s full-time military service is 40 years of age.  For former PDF members who had held the rank of Sergeant or Petty Officer or higher non-commissioned rank there is an age limit for 45 years of age on offering themselves for enlistment to the RDF.  Therefore, it is open to the individual concerned to apply to the RDF if he so chooses.</p></reply>
