In the most recent budget the Government confined such measures to the fee-charging sector and protected schools in the free scheme from any changes in pupil-teacher ratios. It is also worth noting that, unlike almost all other parts of the public sector, up to 900 additional teachers are being recruited this year to accommodate the demographic growth in our primary and secondary schools.  To put the survey quoted by the Deputy in a wider context, total teacher numbers at post-primary level in the coming school year are expected to be less than 2% below 2008 levels although I do acknowledge that pupil numbers will be just over 7% higher. All public servants are being asked to do more with less and teachers in our schools, although better sheltered than other sectors, cannot be immune from this requirement.</p><p>  Each school is required to manage its subject provision from within its approved allocation from the Department. If a school has particular short-term issues in relation to managing its subject provision there are standard arrangements in place for considering applications for some limited short term support.</p></reply>

The PE curriculum includes six strands that provide a balanced physical education programme. The strands are: Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities, and Aquatics.</p><p>  My Department also supports the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme which is a mandatory requirement at primary level. SPHE stresses the importance of regular exercise, as well as the need for a balanced diet as being essential to physical and mental well being.  </p><p>  In addition, schools can also participate in the Active School Flag programme. Since September 2009, more than 1,000 primary schools have applied to participate in the programme. Schools are playing an important role in promoting physical activity, both through the formal curricula and also through extra curricula activities. However, their efforts must be supported and complemented by parents and the local community, and other stakeholders. </p></reply>

However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations.  The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.  There are no plans to review this decision.  It is important to note that the provision of guidance in schools is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor.</p><p>  Initial findings of a recent comprehensive survey by the National Centre for Guidance in Education on schools provision for guidance would suggest that even though there has been a cut in the allocation schools continue to prioritise the guidance programme and within it have increased group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle. This approach maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p></reply>

Children should be able to run and move freely in the school yard unless there are very compelling health and safety reasons for individual schools to prohibit such activity.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the responsibilities on individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools.  It is also a matter for school authorities to determine school policies, taking into account any health and safety risks to children running in the school yard and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate any potential risk to the school community.  While appreciating that it is not always possible to eliminate all risks, it should nevertheless be possible, with appropriate supervision, to manage them in such a manner that pupils can run in school yards provided it is done in an orderly and supervised manner.</p></reply>

The new school self-evaluation system, introduced during this school year, requires principals and teachers to identify what they are doing well and what needs to improve.  In addition, there is a well-established system of external inspection covering all schools.  The Inspectorate's evaluations are based on classroom observations of teaching and a strong focus on learner outcomes.  Reports arising from whole-school evaluations and subject inspections are published regularly.  Evaluations and reviews of individual teachers' performance are also conducted during the probationary phase for newly-qualified teachers, and as part of a formal process for dealing with underperforming teachers.

The Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011, provides for the development of a new policy framework for procurement. This work is now being led by the newly appointed Chief Procurement Officer, Paul Quinn. Under his leadership a new national procurement office for the public sector is being established. Paul is currently working with officials across the public sector to put in place new sectoral and centralised procurement arrangements.</p><p>  My colleague Minister Howlin has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public sector is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. Centralising the procurement of commonly used goods and services can deliver significant benefits which include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and enhanced service levels.  In addition, given the financial constraints within which we must all now work, cost reductions and savings can go some way to helping Exchequer funded bodies, such as schools, manage within reducing financial budgets. </p><p>  The Deputies may be aware that the National Procurement Service (NPS) is supporting Small and Medium Business Enterprises (SMEs) to participate in public sector procurement competitions through its education and guidance strategies. All of the NPS tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs in competitions, by encouraging them to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.</p><p>  I understand that Irish SMEs have been successful in winning NPS frameworks and about three quarters of existing NPS contracts/frameworks are held by SMEs. These SMEs may, in turn, source many of their services and products from local manufacturers and agents.  However, I do appreciate the concerns being raised by small school supply companies and I have asked relevant officials here in the Department, who are coordinating procurement reform in the Education and Training sector, to take these concerns into consideration in the context of the work being undertaken on procurement reform. </p></reply>

In the event that a student does not study History as a discrete subject, there is still a requirement of schools to ensure that students meet the statements of learning, including &quot;values local, national and internation heritage, understands the importance of the relationship between past and current events and the forces that drive change&quot;.  Individual schools will have the flexibility to decide how they may do this. For example, a school or group of schools in a town,  may opt to develop a short course in History to reflect a particular historical event relevant to their area.</p><p>  I met with the representatives of the History Teachers' Association of Ireland in early 2012 and the discussion at that meeting helped to inform the final Framework document.  I have every confidence that the changes envisaged in Framework for Junior Cycle will ensure that the place of historical study will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements in small primary schools are considerably more favourable than other medium to larger schools.  The budget measure is focused on dealing with this cost premium, on a phased basis, through progressively increasing the pupil thresholds for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  This budget measure relates to the number of teachers allocated to small primary schools and there are no plans to change it.</p><p>  This Government has protected education as much as it can. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p><p>  The value for money review of small primary school provision is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I expect to publish the review and I look forward to debating its findings at that stage.</p></reply>

However the alternative was to adjust the PTR staffing allocations. The budget decision sheltered the impact for all DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. There are no plans to review this decision.  It is important to note that the provision of guidance in schools is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor.</p><p>  Initial findings of a recent comprehensive survey by the National Centre for Guidance in Education on schools provision for guidance would suggest that even though there has been a cut in the allocation schools continue to prioritise the guidance programme and within it have increased group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle. This approach maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.</p></reply>

Some 66 grant awarding authorities were involved, all using a variety of application, assessment and payment processes. Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) replaces all of these with a centralised, and on-line system of application. While there have been problems with the first year of the new system, I still believe that policy decision was correct, and that the establishment of a single grant awarding body will serve our students better in the long run. I am satisfied that City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee should continue to carry out this function for the coming 2013/14 academic year.</p><p>  An external review of Student Universal Support Ireland's business processes is currently being undertaken to inform improvements in the system for the 2013/14 academic year. The review is at an advanced stage and is currently being finalised by Accenture the company carrying out the review.</p><p>  In advance of the review, SUSI is currently undertaking a number of measures to improve the processing system for 2013/14. In order to reduce the volume of documents required to be supplied by applicants SUSI is currently liasing with other public service organisations such as Revenue and the CAO with a view to putting arrangements in place to facilitate block transfer of data directly from organisation to organisation in compliance with data protection requirements.

The combined costs of curriculum and CPD support in a full year will be of the order of &euro;10 million.  A Junior Cycle Support Service will be established under the directorship of Dr. P&aacute;draig Kirk, currently CEO of Co.

But even in these very difficult financial times, this Government believes in investing in our children and all the necessary resources will be provided to make this a success.</p><p>  The Department has established an Education Partners Consultation Group to provide the partners, including the ASTI and TUI, with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased implementation of the Junior Cycle.  These meetings are currently happening approximately every 4 to 6 weeks.  At these meetings the partners have a forum in which to highlight both the opportunities and challenges of the reform.</p><p>  In addition the ASTI and the TUI are represented on the Council of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and on its Subject Development Groups.  At these meetings the future shape of the curriculum is considered and their findings are presented to the Minister.  </p><p>  The latest edition of Education at a Glance published by the OECD in September 2012 showed that Ireland had the fifth highest proportion of persons aged 25 to 34 who completed upper secondary at 87%.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-17a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041700068#WRH01000"><p>My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs.  Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports.  Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required.  Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children.  Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.  Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased.  Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act.  While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.</p><p>  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.  My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism.  It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.</p><p>  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

However, my proposals do go further in relation to assessment &ndash; and the move away from a terminal exam to school based assessment. </p><p>  Evidence has repeatedly shown that "unless the examination changes, nothing else will." Ireland is an outlier in international terms in having externally set, moderated and marked examinations at the end of lower secondary school. As some 90% of students now complete senior cycle, the Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination for the overwhelming majority of students; treating it as such has been shown to have an unintended negative backwash effect on teaching, learning and assessment in the classroom. </p><p>  The Leaving Certificate is a high stakes examination.

The closure of the resident embassy to the Holy See has yielded substantial savings, not least as it enabled the significantly larger embassy to Italy and the residence of the ambassador to Italy to be relocated to the State-owned Villa Spada, formerly occupied by the embassy to the Holy See, thereby saving &euro;445,000 per annum in rent on two properties. Ambassador Cooney travels to Rome regularly and was present for the inauguration of Pope Francis, to which he accompanied the President and the Minister for Finance who represented the Government and subsequently at the Pope&rsquo;s meeting with the Diplomatic Corps. I am satisfied that the current arrangement for Ireland&rsquo;s representation at the Holy See is the most effective possible in light of the resource constraints faced by my Department.

This is one of the few exemptions from the LPT.  Limiting the number of exemptions keeps the rate of the tax low for those who are liable to it.  Based on the information provided by the Deputy it appears that the individual would not qualify for this exemption.</p><p>  While exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.  Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted, unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  </p><p>  Given the Budget constraints that exist, and in order to be in a position to keep the rate of tax as low as possible, I decided that an upper limit would be imposed on the reduction in the chargeable value that is allowed.  This means that where the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property exceeds the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme, the reduction in the chargeable value will be capped at the maximum grant payable.  </p><p>  This relief is linked to the grant scheme for such adaptations that is administered by the local authorities so that there would be some independent verification of the necessity to have particular adaptations carried out.  The additional value that is attributable to adaptations carried out to a property can only be deducted from the overall chargeable value where a grant towards the cost of the adaptation has been made by a local authority.  This effectively means that tax relief for local property tax purposes is determined by decisions that have been made by a local authority about whether a person with a disability requires the property in which he or she resides to be adapted to cater for the particular disability.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners will not be required to make such decisions. </p><p>  Provisions are also made for deferral of LPT for individuals whose income is under certain limits.</p></reply>

Section 17 introduces a new section 782A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a three-year window of opportunity to draw down, on a once-off basis, up to 30% of the accumulated value of certain AVCs made by them, including additional voluntary PRSA contributions made to AVC PRSAs. Where AVCs are subject to a pension adjustment order, both parties to the order may exercise the option independently in respect of their respective &ldquo;share&rdquo; of the AVCs.   </p><p>  The procedures set out in the legislation for exercising the AVC access option are straight forward and I have outlined these hereunder. However, in addition to these procedures, I am aware from discussions which my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had with various pension industry representative bodies, that the administrators of AVC funds will also be putting administrative procedures and systems in place to facilitate the access option at an operational level. I understand that these administrative and systems procedures are in the process of being finalised. </p><p>  The likelihood is, of course, that an individual contemplating availing of the option will firstly contact his pension fund administrator by phone or email to establish what he or she needs to do. In that regard, the legislation requires the individual to give an irrevocable written instruction to the administrator of the fund that he or she wishes to avail of the option. Provided the individual qualifies for the encashment option, the administrator acts on the instruction by determining the value of the AVC fund and paying an amount, not exceeding 30% of the value, to the individual subject to deduction of the appropriate amount of tax. The amount paid is treated as emoluments to which Schedule E applies and tax is collected at source under the PAYE system. The legislation requires the administrator to deduct tax at the higher rate of 41%, unless the administrator has received from Revenue a tax credit certificate in respect of the individual. The payments are specifically exempt from USC and PRSI.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in advance of any payment of AVCs being made, the individual exercising the option should contact his or her Revenue Office for a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate Cut-off point in respect of the AVC payment. It may be the case that the pension fund administrator will contact Revenue on behalf of the individual, but where the individual is applying directly to Revenue he or she would need to advise Revenue of the pension fund administrator's registered number (i.e. employer number) so that Revenue can forward the Certificate to the correct administrator. The Certificate will indicate the Standard Rate Cut-off Point and tax credits, if any, appropriate to the AVC access payment and facilitate the deduction of the correct amount of tax by the administrator. </p></reply>

I understand that the regulations are currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p><p>  I am advised by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government that homeowners will be required to demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, IS 398 &ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1 .  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.</p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.  Significant pyritic damage to common areas, in situations where the relevant property itself is unaffected or in respect of which a certificate is not issued, would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property.</p><p>  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, I understand that provision will be made in the Regulations being made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the use, where feasible, of test results from sampling and testing undertaken to classify the sub-floor hardcore material prior to the publication of I.S. 398.  Such testing results must be validated by a competent person as being in accordance with, or equivalent to, I.S. 398. A building condition assessment will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when such testing is, or was, carried out. </p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued. He or she should notify Revenue at that stage to claim the exemption. Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014. As an alternative to such retrospective treatment, they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.</p></reply>

In September the European Commission presented legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) conferring powers on the ECB for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis.  The SSM is a key element of the Banking Union along with a common resolution framework and national deposit guarantee schemes.  The Member States have reaffirmed their commitment to the urgent completion of all elements of Banking Union as set out by the European Council.</p><p>  The Banking Union package is a priority of the Irish Presidency of the EU Council. An important step to a European Banking Union to break the link between sovereigns and banks was agreed by Ecofin Ministers in Dublin last week when they reached agreement on the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  This is a major step towards ensuring financial stability, and thus facilitating growth.  Earlier in 2013 the Irish Presidency concluded negotiations with the European Parliament to finalise the Capital Requirements Directive IV which is another essential element of the Banking Union programme.  Another important element of the Banking Union package is the development of an operational framework for the direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM which should include the definition of legacy assets.  A Task Force of Member States has been meeting regularly since October 2012 and it expected that the ESM instrument guidelines will be finalised by end June.</p><p>  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a common resolution framework mentioned above includes provision for resolution funds to be used for supporting orderly resolution of banks in distress.  It proposes that national resolution funds would interact, notably to provide funding for resolving cross-border banks.  The proposal also suggests giving national resolution funds a right to borrow from their counterparts in other Member States in the event that there are insufficient funds in their own resolution fund.  This right to borrow would be complemented with an obligation to lend to other funds within the Union.  Safeguards would be in place to ensure that no national fund would be obliged to lend in circumstances where it wold not have sufficient funds to finance a resolution in its own territory in the foreseeable future or where the loan required would exceed more than half of the available funds in the lending Member States resolution fund.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal is currently being examined intensively at Council under the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  In the domestic area the Programme for Government included commitments to introduce a comprehensive special resolution regime for banks and a bank levy.  The Government has fulfilled these commitments through the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act and the Resolution Fund established under it.  The Resolution Fund provides a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution.  The levy contributions by credit institutions under Regulations made under the Act feed into the Resolution Fund.  The Resolution Fund will primarily be made up of contributions from credit institutions.  The overall objective is to minimise taxpayers&rsquo; exposure to future financial sector difficulties.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results.</p><p>  I, and the Government, acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.  If remuneration costs are to be reduced with the aim of a return to profitability then sacrifices at all employee levels will be required.</p></reply>

This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.  The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.</p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.</p><p>  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.  There is no specific breakdown in these figures of the costs related to physiotherapy.</p><p>  If self-referral for physiotherapy were allowed, an estimate of the additional cost would be unquantifiable, but, undoubtedly, it would increase the overall cost of health expenses relief to the Exchequer.  While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an extension of the relief along the lines proposed would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.</p><p>  I would point out that this issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013 during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a significant number of multiple property owners are already obliged, by virtue of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to pay and file their tax returns electronically and section 44 is in keeping with the overall eGovernment Strategy and Revenue&rsquo;s strategic objective to encourage the use of electronic channels.  Revenue has developed a secure on-line system for filing LPT Returns that is user friendly and easily accessible on the Revenue website.  From the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, using the on-line system is the quickest and most straightforward way to complete and submit their LPT Returns, particularly so where there are multiple properties involved, as the system automatically calculates the LPT due for the individual properties, makes it easy to select a payment method from the wide range of options available and provides immediate access to Revenue&rsquo;s on-line valuation guide.  In addition, property owners who file their LPT Returns on-line will also benefit from a three-week extended filing deadline to 28 May 2013.</p><p>  Section 36 of the Act allows a Return to be made by any person authorised to do so by a liable person.  For example, a property owner may nominate a relative such as their son or daughter to file and pay on-line.</p><p>  I am further advised that Revenue announced yesterday that, where none of these arrangements are suitable for owners of multiple properties, they can call the LPT Helpline 1890 200 255 to pay and file their LPT on-line.  Before calling the LPT Helpline, owners should ensure that they have the necessary information: their PPSN, property details (including Property ID, PIN code and valuation band for each property) and details of their bank account or other source from which the LPT will be deducted.</p></reply>

The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  This Register has been used to issue correspondence to property owners and by 16 April 2013, Revenue had issued 1.29 million letters to owners of 1.6 million properties. According to the Register there are 1.13 million owners who will be liable to pay the tax on a single residential property.  It is expected that letters will issue this week to owners of approximately 35,000 properties.  Given the scale of the task involved and the multiple sources that have been used to create the Register, I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners are continuing to update the Register with new cases as they come to light, and letters will continue to issue to newly identified property owners as a result.  I am further advised by the Commissioners that where an owner is not on Revenue&rsquo;s Register a return will not issue.  However, the owner is still obliged to complete and file a Return by the relevant deadline (7 May for paper filers and 28 May for electronic filers).</p><p>  As part of its media campaign, Revenue will advise property owners this week that, if they have not yet received a Return from Revenue, they should contact Revenue&rsquo;s LPT Helpline on 1890 200 255 or access the online system on Revenue&rsquo;s website to file their LPT Return.  I am also advised that even where a property owner has not received a Property ID and PIN code from Revenue, they will still be able to file their Return online.</p></reply>

The allocation of funding to local authorities, as well as criteria in assessing such allocation, is properly a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Government has accepted, in principle, a policy position that from next year 80% of all Local Property Tax (LPT) receipts should be retained within the local authority areas where the properties are based.  The remaining 20% of the LPT collected nationally will go to the Local Government Fund, which will continue to provide funding to local authorities on a needs and resources basis.</p><p>  Income from the LPT will accrue to the local authorities to fund local services.

It provides a direct entry access route to further and higher education and the labour market.  This is no longer true of the Junior Certificate for the vast majority of students.  Just as we reached a point in 1967, where there was no longer a need for a state examined Primary Certificate, I believe we have now reached that point in relation to the Junior Certificate.  The abolition of the Primary Certificate did not change primary school teachers from advocates for their students to judges of them.  It removed a narrow external assessment, and paved the way for the introduction of a child-centred curriculum for pupils.  The Framework will create interested, independent learners who will be better prepared to meet the challenges of life beyond school.  I believe these reforms will enable the educational system to deliver a junior cycle that places the needs of students at the core of quality learning, teaching and assessment.</p><p>  Extensive quality assurance measures are being built into the new Junior Cycle.  These include subject specifications with clear learning outcomes; a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers, principals and deputy principals in, inter alia, educational assessment, including processes of moderation; the introduction of standarised tests for all schools and students in English reading, Mathematics and Science and in Irish reading for Irish-medium schools; and the development of an assessment and moderation toolkit.  Assessment for learning will have a key role and will enhance learning throughout the three years of Junior Cycle.  It will be complemented by the two components of assessment of learning.  There will be the school work component which will be based on work undertaken by students in their second and third years and there will also be a final assessment component at the end of third year.  There will be a school report.  The report will include a School Certificate of results in eight to ten subjects or their equivalents.  The report will also include a student profile which will reflect their other learning experiences.</p><p>  Subjects and short courses with their new modes of assessment are being introduced on a phased basis from September 2014 so that capacity in the system can be built up incrementally.  Additional quality assurance measures in relation to assessment of learning at end of junior cycle, to maximise impartiality, include the following:</p><p>- The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is fully established</p><p>- For English, Irish and Mathematics, the SEC will initially mark these papers. This arrangement will continue until standardised testing becomes established in junior cycle</p><p>- For the school work component, schools will undertake internal moderation in accordance with the guidelines on moderation for Junior Cycle assessment which will be formally confirmed by the principal</p><p>- The results awarded on every School Certificate of Learning will be sent to the Department.</p><p>  The Department will monitor the national and school patterns along with the results in the standardised testing of reading, Mathematics and Science.  This monitoring will provide further quality assurance and identify any local or national anomalies.  A report on overall trends will be published regularly.  In the event of an unusual pattern of achievement, the Inspectorate of the Department will be advised, and support and evaluation measures will be provided for the school.  In addition, national monitoring of standards will be complemented by continued participation in national and international assessments.</p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community and Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.</p><p>  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education and Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.</p></reply>

It is important to note that over 50% of disadvantaged students do not attend DEIS schools.  Therefore while the majority of schools include, among their pupils, children with disadvantaged backgrounds, in general most schools address the individual needs of these children without recourse to additional targeted resources.</p><p>  A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.  Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils.  All primary and post- primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  NEPS psychologists are assigned schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix and geographical spread.  DEIS schools are both afforded a priority in the assigning of a NEPS psychologist and a premium in time allocated by the psychologist to the school over non-DEIS schools.</p><p>  It is also important to note that poverty is one of wide range of issues which impacts on the learning capacity of pupils and in respect of which interventions are made by a number of Government Departments and agencies.  The targeting of resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage remains a key priority for my Department.</p></reply>

I have ring-fenced &euro;500,000 to support implementation of these actions this year.  Officials from my Department have already commenced work on the implementation of the actions.  In particular, an awareness raising initiative on cyber bullying targeted at young people is already underway and my Department is supporting the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which took place in March.  Work has also commenced on developing new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the school management bodies, teacher unions and national parents councils.  These new procedures are due to issue to schools for the start of the next school year.</p><p>  Bullying and mental health have been prioritised for teacher education summer courses in 2013.  The National Disability Authority have commenced work on researching effective supports for children with physical disabilities and/or special educational needs.  Preliminary work has commenced on other aspects of the Action Plan on Bullying. Implementation will continue in the coming months.</p></reply>

This includes Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) through the universal pre-school provision scheme; Second-Chance education and training and access measures to increase participation in further and higher education for the minority of our young people who, for various reasons, leave education early without the knowledge and skills they need to support them in later life. A further element of this continuum is the ongoing development of provision for pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>  In 2009 the National Educational Welfare Board was given an extended remit which involved the integration of the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team to provide for a single, strategic approach to attendance, participation and retention in school. The aim of this integration of services is to meet the needs of children and improve educational outcomes for those most at risk of early school leaving or of developing school attendance problems.</p><p>  Following from the expansion of the remit of the Board, and its transfer to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2011, the NEWB has developed a new Integrated Model of Service Delivery called 'One Child, One Team, One Plan'.  The Plan, which I understand is to be rolled out shortly, will integrate the overall Educational Welfare Service with the key DEIS supports of the Home School Community Liaison Service and School Completion Programme.  This will lead to earlier response rates and assist in achieving better outcomes for children at risk of early school leaving.</p><p>  The latest Report on Retention Rates in Post Primary Schools, published in 2012 and available on my Department's website, presents the retention rates of pupils who entered the first year of the junior cycle in the years from 2005 to 2006 and completed second level schooling no later than 2012. This report shows the following encouraging results: the percentage of students who sit the Leaving Cert overall has risen by more than 6% to 90.2% in 8 years; the average Leaving Certificate retention rate in DEIS schools increased by almost 7 percentage points from 73.2% to 80.1% for students who entered second level in 2004 to 2006 while the retention rate in non-DEIS schools increased from 87.4% to 92.7% for the same entry cohorts; the number of young men staying in secondary school has risen dramatically to 88.7% compared to 76.9% in the 2001 cohort.</p></reply>

Figures for the 2011/2012 academic year are available on the Department's website at </p><p>  The Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013/14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department has published the staffing arrangements at primary and post primary level for the coming school year, 2013/14 which are available on the Department's website.</p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are set out in the circulars referred to above. The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.  The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.</p></reply>

The vast majority of teachers choose on a voluntary basis whether and when they will retire and are required to give notice to their management authority of their intention to do so.  Accordingly the likely number of retirements in any year is difficult to quantify in advance.</p><p>  Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department publishes the staffing arrangements at primary and post primary level on the Department's website and schools are aware of their allocation for each school year.

I have, however, noted the findings of the Equality Audit Report which was commissioned by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO).</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that work-life balance arrangements in the public service are, and will continue to be, among the best available options provided by Irish employers.  This is particularly the case when considered in tandem with annual leave and other family friendly provisions.  Such initiatives allow the public service workforce to be more inclusive.</p><p>  The  proposals by the LRC were aimed at streamlining existing arrangements so that a satisfactory balance could be struck between the delivery of the business needs of the employer &ndash; in this case the consistent delivery of high quality services to the public &ndash; and the need for working parents and carers to have flexibility to meet their personal commitments.</p><p>  Under the LRC proposals, it was the intention that the current range of flexible working arrangements would continue to be available across the public service, including flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme, career breaks, as well as all of the statutory entitlements such as parental leave and carer&rsquo;s leave.  This is an extensive range of options within which public service employees can balance their work-life commitments. </p><p>  The Irish public service has a proud record of promoting these arrangements and the employee profile across the service reflects the strong efforts made over the last few decades to ensure that public servants&rsquo; employment terms allow them to balance their work and home commitments.</p></reply>

This measure, which came into effect on 28 July 2012  , applies to &lsquo;pre-existing&rsquo; public service pension schemes. Persons exceeding the limit on 28 July 2012 do not lose any service accrued up to that point. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that such a limit already applies to service in any one scheme and, consistent with the practice in such cases, contributions continue to be paid beyond the 40 year point. In this regard I would point out that, in final salary schemes, pensions on retirement reflect changes in pay (e.g. increments or changes   in grade, etc) occurring after the 40 year limit. Similarly, any increase in pay occurring after the 40 year limit would enhance the value of the superannuation lump sum.</p></reply>

However, the Act maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities, including play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools, which are operated on a commercial for-profit basis are liable for rates.</p><p>  I have no plans to provide for special treatment of private childcare facilities under the Valuation Act which provides that all buildings used for commercial enterprises are valued in a fair and equitable manner.

However such mechanisms were omitted from the current draft of the Bill in order to reduce the administrative and cost burden to the small businesses that make up a large proportion of our construction industry.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Bill is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts.  This is achieved by providing a statutory schedule of payments, prohibiting the use of &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; clauses in construction contracts and, most importantly, it provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and the provision of statutory adjudication.  Given these provisions the requirement for security of payment reduces since the exposure of a subcontractor to non-payment is greatly reduced.</p><p>  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction is currently reviewing the use of Project Bank Accounts in relation to the public works contracts and is expected to conclude that process shortly and report back to me on the matter.</p></reply>

The budget has to be agreed with the European Parliament and discussions are now taking place with the Parliament under the aegis of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  Despite an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s overall Structural Funds allocation from the &euro;901 million we receive under the current round to &euro;979 million in the 2014 &ndash; 2020 round, the allocation for the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region was reduced.  This is because the region no longer qualified as a transition region since its GDP per capita exceeded 90% of the EU average in 2007 &ndash; 2009 - the period used to determine the status of regions across the EU for the purposes of the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014 &ndash; 2020.  This meant that the status of the BMW Region has changed from that of a &ldquo;transition region&rdquo; to that of a &ldquo;more developed region&rdquo; relative to other regions throughout the EU 27 Member States.  </p><p>  The Government was concerned that this change in status was likely to lead to a reduction in the BMW Region&rsquo;s allocation from Brussels.  In recognition of the special position of the region, the Government, in the recent MFF negotiations in February, was successful in securing for the region an additional &euro;100 million and additional special allocations under PEACE IV and the Youth Employment Initiative.  The focus on youth unemployment is something the Irish Government had been pressing for.</p><p>  Work in my Department, in conjunction with the Regional Assemblies, has already commenced on the preparation of a new Operational Programme 2014-2020 for the BMW region, which will be submitted to the European Commission for approval later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-17a.364.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041700077#WRR01500"><p>At a macro level the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to re-build the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports. It is in this way that we will create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work. </p><p>  More specifically, engaging with the Diaspora to strengthen and form new relationships is a particular Government priority underpinned by the Global Economic Forum.  For example, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Senior Management team are focusing on the roll-out of a number of joint initiatives, including marketing and events aimed at attracting entrepreneurs and start-ups to Ireland.</p><p>  IDA Ireland engages with the Irish Diaspora working in multinational companies in its role to attract new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland and to build on the existing FDI base to support Irish management to win new business.  The ability of the investor to source the very best quality people, with appropriate levels of training and experience, is a prime consideration and a real location differentiator.  Attracting skilled Irish emigrants back to Ireland is an important component in creating this skill base.  The &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo; initiative to attract greater numbers of inward investors to Ireland provides direct financial incentives to people around the world to create employment in Ireland by making payments to people responsible for bringing sustainable jobs to Ireland.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) also plays a significant role in forging linkages with Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, EI initiatives include: </p><p>  -	A Global Irish Network of advocates was established to maximise the opportunities from Diaspora interest in Ireland and secure greater investment in Ireland. </p><p>-	A &euro;10m International Start-up Fund was established in 2012 and was complimented by a targeted marketing campaign, making greater use of existing   networks in the IDA and the wider Diaspora.  An Enterprise Ireland team has been extensively marketing this initiative.  In 2012, twelve entrepreneurs were supported by Enterprise Ireland to establish their companies here. This campaign is continuing in 2013.</p><p>EI is also involved, in the establishment of www.itshappeninghere.ie, a website which features opportunities in Irish SMEs in the wider ICT sector and allows our Diaspora a full view of the potential opportunities for employment and advancement.  The website brands the Irish indigenous ICT sector as innovative, dynamic and a great place to build an exciting career. In addition, EI sponsors/supports conferences to showcase particular sectors with opportunities.  Such an example is the IN3 Medical Device 360o   Conference which is taking place in Dublin this week.  This is an international networking conference aimed specifically at promoting the Irish Medical Devices sector internationally. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 includes a number of actions which will build on the initiatives already underway under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.</p></reply>

My Department and its agencies has already achieved a 25% reduction in administrative burdens on business, and continues to seek avenues to reduce burdens even further.</p><p>  The High Level Group on Business Regulation, which is chaired by my colleague John Perry, T.D. Minister for Small Business, engages with business directly and hears first-hand about the issues affecting the Irish economy.  The Group is currently progressing a number of priority of issues as part of its 2013 Work Programme. </p><p>  An initiative which I believe has proven to be useful to business is the businessregulation.ie portal which was launched in June 2012.  This portal arose from the need to communicate better with business.  Its purpose is to help business, especially SMEs, identify the main regulations which affect their activities, to assist them in navigating through the complex regulatory landscape and to provide a centralised place for links to the relevant agencies and their guidance, tools and contact points. The portal has already had over 75,000 pageviews and more than 13,000 unique visitors, since launch, and publicity and awareness work is continuing during 2013, including by means of joint business events organised with the regulators and agencies included on the portal.</p><p>  The Government is also currently working on an integrated licensing system to help SME retailers apply for all of their annual licencing requirements at a single time via a single portal.  The new Integrated Licensing Application Portal for retailers will provide significant savings in terms of time and costs for businesses and entrepreneurs across Ireland through the simplification of the process for applying for multiple licences. This will help business competitiveness and will ultimately protect and create more jobs.  The new licensing system will be developed for the retail sector in the first instance by the end of 2013 and rolled out to other sectors of the economy thereafter. It is one of the Government&rsquo;s Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.</p><p>In relation to SMEs acquiring finance, one of the actions contained in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is to &ldquo;promote awareness and understanding of the full range of Government supported funding programmes and incentives in place to meet the financing needs of the SME sector, including through online resources....&rdquo;.   To this end, the Department of Finance has produced a table of State financial supports. This table includes the Government body responsible for the financial support, a description of the support and a link to the relevant webpage. This table will be reviewed on an on-going basis and is available at http://banking.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/State-Financial-Support-for-SMEs.pdf.</p><p>  The Government has set the pillar banks&rsquo; lending targets so that they rise incrementally with expected demand, with targets of &euro;4bn in 2013, increased from &euro;3.5bn in 2012.  Both banks met the targets for 2012.  To ensure information on the demand side is accurate and up to date, the Department of Finance continues to conduct bi-annual surveys of SMEs to assess credit demand and loan approval rates.  </p><p>  My Department has recently introduced two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Credit Guarantee Scheme.  Other initiatives assisting business in this respect include the Development Capital Fund, Innovation Fund and specialist NPRF funds for the SME sector.</p><p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention.  </p></reply>

It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these schemes that a person must be available for full-time work. </p><p>  A person is entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance where they are fully unemployed for at least 4 days in any period of 7 consecutive days.</p><p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of casual workers. In acknowledgement of this trend, the Department has commenced work on the consideration of the future structure of the jobseeker schemes.  In this regard the Department&rsquo;s work is being informed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education report, A Review of the Status of Casual Workers in Ireland.  This report recommended increasing the flexibility of the existing jobseeker schemes by moving from the current days based system to a system of entitlement based on hours.</p><p>  However, increasing flexibility in the system could potentially, depending on the behavioural response, increase the number of people claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment thereby increasing the total cost of the schemes to the Exchequer. </p><p>  Other issues which are under active consideration are, aligning the jobseeker&rsquo;s week to the calendar week and compensating for the loss of employment only or stated availability, whichever is the lesser.</p><p>  This work is complex and is taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms including the recognition of Sunday working for jobseekers, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative change that implementation of reform to the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes will require.</p></reply>

Following a review of the defined benefit model which was completed in 2011, I introduced a requirement for defined benefit pension schemes to hold a risk reserve which was designed to protect the interest of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets. I also introduced a range of options which will assist trustees of schemes in meeting this requirement. In view of current funding difficulties experienced by many defined benefit schemes, schemes will have until the end of 2023 to satisfy this requirement.</p><p>  You will appreciate that the issue of how the assets of a pension scheme are distributed on the wind-up of a pension scheme is a complex and sensitive issue and one which requires careful consideration before any change is made to the current provisions. In this regard, my officials have completed a detailed review of these provisions which involved engagement with stakeholder representatives and with external consultants who provided valuable assistance in reviewing this issue. </p><p>  The outcome of this review is being considered at present.</p></reply>

The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks. On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings. A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.   This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.</p><p>  However, once the 52 week period has expired, customers are invited to re-apply.  If at that stage they continue to satisfy the basic qualifying conditions their up-to-date family income will be assessed for FIS purposes and a change in rate will be approved if appropriate.</p><p>  For renewal claims processed in the last 6 months of 2012, 43% had a reduction in rate following renewal, 50% had an increase in rate following renewal and 7% remained at the same rate for a further 52 weeks.</p><p>  Customers have the right to appeal any decision made on their FIS entitlement, if they are dissatisfied with it, to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.</p><p>In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies. Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time</p><p>In this context, the major elements of this Department&rsquo;s response are set out in the Pathways to Work policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p>The Pathways to Work approach involves more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were almost 130,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in 2012. Employment services are delivered through the Department&rsquo;s own offices and through a number of Local Employment Services funded by the Department.</p><p>My Department operates a number of programmes to support job seekers in moving towards employment. They range across a number of types of support:- work experience, temporary employment, self-employment, subsidised recruitment by employers, and financial support for unemployed people undertaking certain training and education courses.</p><p>In relation to work experience, some 5,900 people are currently participating on JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme). The total number of starters on JobBridge during 2012 was 9,575. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, by Indecon International Economic Consultants (published &ndash; 5th October 2012) found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.</p><p>The Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. In addition, the Department also has responsibility for the Rural Social Scheme (RSS) which is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen/women. There were just under 3,000 participants on the scheme in 2012. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme (Jobstart) with the Local Authorities.</p><p>In relation to moving into self-employment, currently, almost 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance Enterprise Scheme (BTWEA) scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) scheme. BTWA is designed to encourage the long term unemployed to take up self-employment opportunities by allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their social welfare payment plus secondary benefits over three years. STEA provides immediate support for someone in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit who wants to start a business.</p><p>In relation to subsidised recruitment by employers, the Department supports persons with disabilities entering employment through the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme. The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week. The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market. It is implemented on behalf of the Department by sponsor organisations that employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker. The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support. Over 4,500 persons benefited from this scheme in 2012.</p><p>In July of this year, the Government will launch The JobsPlus incentive scheme which will encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. The new incentive will be payable monthly in arrears, over a 2-year period. There will be 2 levels of incentive: &euro;7,500 for recruits unemployed for more than 12 but less than 24 months and &euro;10,000 for recruits unemployed for more than 24 months. This new incentive will replace the Revenue Job Assist and the Employer PRSI Incentive schemes.</p><p>In terms of financial support for those undertaking up-skilling, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Almost 26,000 people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.  Some 61% of recipients pursued third level courses while 39% pursued courses described as being at second level. A majority of these second-level courses are Post Leaving Cert (PLC courses) undertaken in the further education sector.</p><p>Two further up-skilling options available are the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;D). In each case, jobseekers who wish to engage in part time day, evening or weekend courses or more intensive short duration courses of education and training may do so while retaining their jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.</p><p>BTEA and PTEO have been used as a means of facilitating the participation of unemployed job seekers in a range of special programmes implemented by the Department of Education and Skills over the last few years under the Labour Market Activation Fund, Springboard, and Momentum. The last of these, Momentum, is currently being rolled out and will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 long-term unemployed to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors</p><p>Up-skilling options are also supported by my Department under TESG (Technical Employment Support Grant) and TATS (Technical Assistance and Training scheme). There were just under 17,000 beneficiaries of TATS/TESG in 2011. Both TESG and TATS are designed to allow DSP to offer flexible additional help (in the form of access to training, advice, or support for the purchase of certain goods and services) to a number of categories of unemployed people. TESG support can be for purchase of training (where this cannot be provided by a state provider within a reasonable time) or for certain other expenditures such as purchase of tools, travel costs to job interviews.

The Government has provided &euro;47.6 million for the scheme in 2013.</p><p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment, or no predetermined amounts under the different categories for ENPs.  Such payments are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>  A review of the guidelines on ENPs was carried out by a Departmental working group made up of community welfare service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review was to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of ENPs in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly communions and confirmations, and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to financial need and not to occasions.</p><p>  For 2013, the Department has recommended that payment of the allowance specifically in respect of religious ceremonies will cease. Applications can continue to be made under the scheme for assistance with child clothing. Over 570 claims - at a cost of approximately &euro;56,000 - have been paid under the child clothing category during 2013 to date. I have no plans to reverse this decision as this measure ensures that the ENP scheme will continue to respond to specific need and not to the occasion.</p><p>  This recommendation does not affect the discretion available to officers administering the scheme in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in a particular hardship situation which may arise. Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Monaghan, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie  .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme and the Rural Broadband Scheme.</p><p>  With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30 Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has identified, following the evaluation of tender responses to a request for experts, the preferred bidder to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Monaghan, will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in the private rented residential sector.   I have no function in the operational matters of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).</p><p>  Following a review of the Residential Tenancies Act in 2009, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No 2) Bill 2012 was published on 19 July 2012 and Second Stage concluded in the D&aacute;il on 24   January 2013.</p><p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 builds on what has been achieved by the Act and by the PRTB and provides for the further development of the rental sector into the future. It will, inter alia  , extend the remit of the Act and of the Board to the approved housing body sector and will give legal effect to the administrative merger of the Rent Tribunal and the PRTB. It will also streamline and simplify aspects of the Act to assist the Board in meeting its service obligations and in addressing the additional demands associated with the proposed expansion of its remit.</p><p>  While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas. In particular, I intend to provide for the establishment of a deposit protection scheme to address the illegal retention of tenants&rsquo; deposits by landlords. I also hope to address a number of other key on-going concerns within the sector such as the over holding of rented property by tenants.</p></reply>

Prior to this the LEADER elements were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national Exchequer sources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.</p><p>  However, given the levels of spending by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013, at which time the co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond that date. As a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will change. In the context of these changes to the co-funding rate the original project allocations given to each LDC contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP require readjustment.  </p><p>  An exercise is currently being carried out to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to rebalance the programme in as equitable a way as possible, and indicate the remaining funding available for project commitments. I expect this exercise to be completed shortly.  </p></reply>

A key objective is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year,   Irish Water will, therefore, become the water services authority from 1 January 2014. </p><p>The transfer of assets from the existing water services authorities to Irish Water supports the overall objective of delivering efficiencies within the sector by allowing Irish Water to control assets, revenues and costs, thereby supporting better economies of scale in terms of both capital investment and operating costs, and optimise borrowing capacity.    The identification and valuation of the relevant asset base and the development of policy and legislation for the transfer of these assets is being progressed. W ork is also underway on the boundary issues between functions which will transfer to Irish Water and those remaining with local authorities. The financial implications for the local govern ment sector following the transfer of functions are   also under consideration including the treatment of rateable assets which are transferred to Irish Water. </p><p>  The implementation strategy is being rolled out under a range of workstreams which involve local authority, Departmental and Bord G&aacute;is personnel and using the range of skills and experience in these organisations. Bord G&aacute;is are also in the process of seconding 80 to 90 staff from local authorities and the Department to support work on the Irish Water programme. External service providers, appointed by Bord G&aacute;is by way of public procurement processes, will be involved in various aspects of the programme including company establishment, customer service and billing and the water metering programme. It would be expected that all expenditure incurred by Bord G&aacute;is would be subject to rigorous assessment prior to being incurred and to strict control procedures with a view to ensuring that the required work is undertaken in the most economically advantageous way.</p><p>  It will be a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in due course to satisfy itself in relation to the appropriateness of costs incurred in the operation of Irish Water.</p><p>  A Local Authority Transition Office has been established by the City and County Managers Association to coordinate local government input into the water reform programme. The Department has agreed to provide funding for the work of the Transition Office, including the use by it of external service providers where necessary, subject to appropriate budgetary control procedures.</p></reply>

The approach being taken for the sub-contractor panel is consistent with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on facilitating SME participation in public procurement (that Department&rsquo;s Circular 10/10 refers). A significant number of SME contractors have pre-qualified following the procurement process. It is expected that the successful regional management contractors will be utilising the resources of these sub-contractors for the purpose of delivering the meter installation works.

Questions concerning the use of Local Property Tax revenue raised in 2013 should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Finance. The Government has recently indicated an intention to move, from 2014, to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The remaining 20% of the Tax collected nationally will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.</p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including, a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p></reply>

Arising from the refusal of their asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were notified that the then Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why deportation orders should not be made against them.  They were subsequently notified of their respective entitlements to apply for subsidiary protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p><p>  The persons concerned submitted applications for subsidiary protection.  When consideration of these applications has been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.  In the event that the applications for subsidiary protection are refused, the position in the State of the persons concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before final decisions are made.

The service does not have staffing implications for the Courts Service.  The Courts Service is happy to support its extension to other venues around the country subject to the availability of on site facilities, e.g. sufficient consultation rooms.  The mediation service that is being provided is provided by the Family Mediation Service and the Legal Aid Board.</p><p>  As the Deputy may already be aware the Dolphin House mediation initiative commenced on 21 March 2011. The project&rsquo;s objective was to offer an alternative to a courts determined outcome and a more appropriate means of resolving certain family disputes through, in the first instance, offering mediation information to persons who have made contact with the Courts Service with a view to issuing proceedings in relation to access, custody or guardianship matters.  A formal mediation process is then offered to parties willing to engage. Legal advice is also available.</p><p>  The net annualised saving from the initiative comes to over &euro;113,000 largely from the overall savings to the courts as a consequence of such cases being re-directed.  To date there have been over 500 mediated agreements resulting from the process.  The Steering Group overseeing the initiative concluded as follows:</p><p>- There are clear cost benefits arising from the initiative and there is potential for further capacity and further savings solely from the current initiative;</p><p>- These cost benefits would be increased significantly if the initiative were extended;</p><p>- There are considerable individual, system and societal benefits to this approach;</p><p>- Based on international experience this approach has the potential to have a significant impact for people involved in family disputes.  Benefits extend beyond the parties to the dispute, notably to children, families and even to society;</p><p>- It also has the potential to impact quite significantly on the administration of justice in family law cases. Notably, it can impact on the number of cases going through the courts system;</p><p>- It has real potential to speed up the resolution of disputes and to do so more cheaply than through the courts process;</p><p>- It generates considerable &lsquo;down-stream&rsquo; savings on other State services;</p><p>- It is an excellent example of the benefits of State bodies providing related services taking an integrated approach.</p><p>  I am particularly conscious of the potential benefits accruing from an integrated approach to seeking to resolve certain family law matters.  This was the main reason for the Family Mediation Service being merged with the Legal Aid Board.  There is a recognition that considerable synergies can be achieved through the merger and in order to further facilitate achieving these the Board is now funded through a single grant in aid.

This regulation applies to all equines, including equines not deemed to be bloodstock or sport horses non-thoroughbred, non-sport horses.</p><p>  The EU legislation relating to the identification and traceability of equines has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31st of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain.  S.I. No 357 of 2011 was amended in September 2012 by S.I. 371 of 2012 in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports and prosecutions in relation to equine identification and to make it an offence to forge or tamper with an equine passport.  Passports are essential in the control and prevention of disease, in public health and animal welfare.</p><p>  My Department introduced enhanced legislation and   procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises such that, from 1 May 2012, anyone who is the owner/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with my Department.  Keepers seeking to register equines are required to have a herd number registered with my Department and to keep records of movements on/off their premises.  This legislation applies to all equines.</p></reply>

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible.  The Agency, upon establishment, will assume full statutory responsibility for a range of child and family services currently provided by three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>  Last week, as part of this ongoing preparatory work, the Government approved, on my recommendation, the appointment of Ms. Norah Gibbons as first Chairperson of the board of the Agency.  In preparation for the formal establishment of the new Agency it is my intention to appoint Ms Gibbons as chair of the existing Family Support Agency, one of the constituent bodies to be merged into the Child and Family Agency.  In line with the practice established by this Government Ms Gibbons will appear before the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee in advance of her taking up her position.  I wish her every success, and I look forward to many positive and productive engagements with her.</p><p>  I also intend to publicly seek expressions of interest through the &ldquo;publicjobs&rdquo; website for remaining members of the Family Support Agency board.  The selection of these board members will reflect the enhanced role being given to this Board in overseeing, on an administrative basis, the governance and organisational preparations for the new Agency.  The Agency will have a particular role in supporting families and communities.  I can assure the Deputy that the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade, and that a community based approach will form an integral part of the new Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  Funding of over &euro;23.5 million has been provided to the Family Support Agency (FSA) for 2013.  This includes a dedicated provision of over &euro;14 million in respect of the Family Resource Centre Programme in 2013.  Under the programme some 106 Family Resource Centres will receive funding from the FSA this year.  The FSA, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers.  In this context the Family Resource Centres have been asked to focus, in particular, on identifying the scope for greater efficiency and for reduction in the administration and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day running of the centres.</p><p>  The new Child and Family Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector reform embarked upon by this Government.  I am confident that these arrangements will provide a robust framework to fully implement the ambitious agenda for children&rsquo;s service reform.</p></reply>

The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of HSE in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.  Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and where concerns about the safety and welfare are identified, the child is placed into the care of the HSE. The numbers of separated children has fallen from 1085 in 2001 to 71 in 2012.  Of those 71 children, 48 were placed in the care of the HSE. </p><p>  The HSE has a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis all children at risk and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols until the young person reaches 18 years.  </p><p>  Upon reaching 18 years, the HSE refers these young people to the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice and Law Reform for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision under the direct provision system.  </p><p>  The HSE and the RIA have an agreed policy in relation to the accommodation of separated children seeking asylum who reach the age of 18 years and there is regular liaison between the two agencies.  I am advised by the Department of Justice that detailed discussions take place between the Separated Children's Team in the HSE and RIA, to ensure the best RIA centre match for the young adult concerned. RIA provides these young adults with full board and accommodation in a direct provision centre.  In practice and with the agreement of the Department of Justice, the HSE has retained young adults in after care for various durations and in very exceptional circumstances, for example where there is severe disability or serious mental or physical health issues.  In addition, the HSE is committed to ensuring continuity of care for all young people who are undertaking their leaving certificate and therefore interprets &quot;18th birthday&quot; as the end of a school year/leaving certificate year following their 18th birthday.  Any change of placement would only be in exceptional circumstances and in the young person&rsquo;s best interests.</p><p>  The recommendations of the Barnardos&rsquo; report will be considered by my officials in the development of relevant policy.</p></reply>

Funding of some &#8364;53.173m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of any  necessary reductions in funding.  </p><p><b></b>With respect to future funding provision, my Department has commenced a comprehensive  Policy and Value for Money Review of youth funding and this report is expected later this year. It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes/services going into the future. </p><p>In addition, my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year. The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote co-ordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years. </p></reply>

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. The proposed legislation is intended to provide for a structured and regulated approach for applicants seeking access to adoption information and is also intended to facilitate contact between parties affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected. </p><p>It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the<b></b>Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. </p><p>It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter  his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  </p><p>A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations. It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.</p><p>It is also intended that, prior to the release of adoption information, counselling will be offered by the Adoption Authority, the HSE or by an accredited body to an adopted person, a birth parent or to an adoptive parent.  </p><p>Complex legal and Constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  including the setting of criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. I have recently received further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in this regard and that advice is currently being examined in my Department.  I am anxious to bring these matters to resolution in order to advance the Heads of Bill to Government. However, there are undoubtedly challenges remaining in developing a workable framework which respects the Constitutional rights of all parties. I remain committed to achieving my policy objectives notwithstanding these challenges.</p></reply>

PEIP supports projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. These programmes are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.  </p><p>  The new Area Based Approach to Child Poverty Initiative will be introduced by my Department later this year.  This initiative was announced in December 2012 and is intended to build on and continue the work of the PEIP.  It has an Exchequer funding allocation of &euro;2.5m in Budget 2013 which is expected to rise to &euro;4.75 by 2015.   At least 6 sites are expected to participate in the new programme.</p><p>  The Initiative reflects the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people where these are currently significantly poorer than they are for children and young people living elsewhere in the State.  Sites will be required to implement programmes which have been shown by rigorous research to have a positive impact on the lives of children and which are appropriate to meeting needs identified in their communities.</p><p>   I am aware of the study referred to by the Deputy.   Incredible Years BASIC Preschool/Early School Parent Training Programme was developed with the aim of training parents to support their children&rsquo;s social and emotional development.  Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme was developed with the aim of training and supporting teachers in classroom management techniques.  </p><p>Incredible Years is one of a number of evidence-based programmes that have been modelled in Ireland. Its evaluation   demonstrated that the programme significantly improved parenting skills, and reduced conduct problems of young children.  In schools, the programme was found to improve teachers' classroom management and fewer child behavioural difficulties.  Such programmes may be considered, as part of applications under the initiative.  An information seminar on the process and and initiative will be held next week, at which the process will be explained in detail to potential applicants.</p></reply>

In addition, there are special capitation rates for persons over 70 residing at home and for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There are also a number of additional payments, e.g. in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (including suturing of cuts and lacerations, recognised vein treatment, etc.), practice support allowances and payments in respect of locum expenses.</p><p>  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contracted GPs based on the size of each GP's GMS panel.  The HSE also pays into a superannuation scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to contracted GPs.</p><p>The PCRS publishes a Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments for each year in respect of payments which it makes to contracted health professionals, including GPs.  These are available on line at: http://www.pcrs.ie/  PCRS Publications.</p><p>  Clause 11 of the current GMS Contract states as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;The medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the relevant Health Board, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  This will include such preventive and developmental services as are currently provided or may be developed in the new style of practice which this agreement facilitates, some of which services may be included on the list of special items of service for which specific payments shall be made.  &rdquo;</p><p>  It is the contracted responsibility of GPs to provide proper and necessary treatment to eligible persons.  If part of that proper and necessary treatment includes routine phlebotomy, GPs must provide such services free of charge under the terms of their contract.  </p><p>  The monitoring and appropriate care of patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy with Warfarin comes within the scope of competence of general practice.  Warfarin testing is carried out by some general practitioners as a matter of course in their practices and I welcome this.  This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for this service.</p><p>  Under the GMS contract, fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences.</p><p>  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners to patients outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While the Minister for Health has no role in relation to such fees, it would be expected that clinicians would have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</p><p>  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  The arrangements in relation to the various services provided to GMS patients, including phlebotomy services and anti-coagulation therapy will be reviewed as part of this process.</p></reply>

Under the Bill, the Irish Medicines Board has statutory responsibility for establishing and publishing a List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products.  </p><p>  In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group:</p><p>  (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group;</p><p>  (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group; and</p><p>  (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group. </p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where:</p><p>-  there is a difference in bio-availability between the medicinal products and the interchangeable medicinal products which currently fall within the group of interchangeable medicinal products which may lead to a clinically significant difference in efficacy between them, and</p><p>-  any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group.</p><p>  I would like to emphasise that in making a decision to add a medicinal product to a group of interchangeable medicinal products or a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products the Board is obliged to have regard to the criteria as set out in the Bill and that these criteria fully reflect the recommendations set out in the Joint Department of Health/HSE report 'Proposed Model of Reference Pricing and Generic Substitution' (the Moran Report, 2010) regarding criteria for interchangeability.     </p><p>  To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised. I met with the Irish Epilepsy Association in January and explained this position.</p><p>  It is also important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.</p></reply>

Among these is a reduction in the income limits for over-70s Medical Cards.  The Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2013 was enacted on 28 March 2013 to give effect to the revised eligibility arrangements.  In addition, the assessment criteria for the standard medical card are being changed.  Home Improvement Loan payments and a &euro;50 per week car allowance in Travel-to-Work expenses will, in future, be excluded from consideration in the means test assessment.</p><p>  The fees and allowances payable to certain health professionals are also being reviewed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009. The professionals concerned include General Practitioners and Pharmacists who hold contracts with the HSE, under the GMS scheme.  Following careful consideration of submissions made during the review, including written and oral submissions made by the Irish Medical Organisation, the Minister for Health will decide whether any reductions in fees/allowances will be made, and, if so, the scale of reductions that would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  Should the Minister decide that reductions are warranted, Regulations will be made under the FEMPI Act with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The research process comprised of two stages. The first stage was an independent draft academic research report , which was based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The second stage in the research process was consultation on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have experienced symphysiotomy. The second stage has just been completed by the researcher and the report has been sent for peer review. It is expected that the report will be finalised and submitted to my Department in May and that it will be published as soon as possible after that. </p><p>  My first priority is to ensure that the women  who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who continue to suffer the effects of having had this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up.</p></reply>

These include the significant strengthening of primary care with the introduction, on a phased basis, of GP care without fees for the whole population.  As part of the first phase of free GP care, legislation is currently being drafted by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department. The legislation will be published when it is completed, with implementation dates and application details to be announced once it is in place. </p><p>  The subsequent introduction of UHI will see the whole population continue to enjoy access to GP care without fees.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  The purchasing of healthcare will be largely devolved to health insurers who will commission care for their members and who will have a duty to use this purchasing role to ensure the provision of quality, continuous care across settings.  In addition, a new Insurance Fund will have a central strategic role, directly financing and centrally controlling some healthcare costs, and working with health insurers to support the delivery of high quality, integrated care.  </p></reply>
