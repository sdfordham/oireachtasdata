As a result of the fiscal policies of this Government and the efforts of the Irish people Ireland is due to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) at the end of this year and will transition to the preventive arm of the SGP.  </p>  <p>  Sustainable fiscal policy will be anchored in the future by adherence to the new fiscal rules which require that Ireland makes the appropriate adjustment each year towards achieving its medium term budgetary objective (MTO), a balanced budget in structural terms. </p>  <p>  As Ireland is subject to the corrective arm of the SGP in 2015, economic growth and greater than expected tax receipts have allowed the Government to improve services in a number of key areas while remaining firmly within our fiscal parameters.  The extra funding of &euro;1.6 billion for gross voted expenditure in 2015 has allowed Government to target additional expenditure in areas experiencing increased demand and to growth enhancing capital expenditure. </p>  <p>  The Capital Investment Framework published by my Department set out a &euro;27 billion multi-annual Exchequer Capital Investment Plan.  This Plan is supported by a programme of capital investment in the wider State sector.  This investment over the period 2016 to 2021 will help to lay the foundations for continued growth.  </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan reflects the Government's commitment to supporting strong and sustainable economic growth and raising welfare and living standards.  The Plan identified critical areas for investment over the 2016-2021 period with an allocation of &euro;3 bn to support the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and a further &euro;3 bn in support of health to deliver major infrastructural projects such as the new National Children's Hospital, which will be the largest health infrastructure project ever undertaken in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As the economy continues to recover we will look to build upon the significant and wide-ranging civil and public service reforms implemented over recent years which have added efficiency and effectiveness to the way in which our public services are delivered and must continue to do so. </p></reply>

The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles.  There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement. </p>  <p>  The multi-annual voted expenditure ceilings in place secure greater transparency in the allocation of resources across Government Departments over a three year horizon.  They also facilitate the work of the Oireachtas in engaging with Ministers and their Departments on their spending priorities. </p>  <p>  The progress achieved in restoring the public finances is evidenced by the fact that from the beginning of next year, Ireland will be subject to the requirements set out under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  In that context it will be essential that Departments prudently manage delivery of services within their voted allocations maintaining our hard-won fiscal stability and helping to support competitiveness, low inflation and economic progress.</p></reply>

There are more nurses, teachers, garda&iacute;, and special needs assistants now than at any time since the onset of the economic and fiscal crisis.  Public service staff numbers have increased by just under 5,000 in the first nine months of 2015 alone, on foot of Budget decisions taken last year, which  also included a removal of the Moratorium on Public Service Recruitment.  Last month, as part of the Budget for 2016, I  announced further additional 2,260 teachers, up to 600 new Garda&iacute;, plus more staff in the Health Sector and for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">As regards the current level of staffing across the Public Service compared to the peak in or around 2009, the changes since then need to be understood and assessed in their proper context.  </font></p><p><font color="#181818">- In the 5-year period leading up to the end of 2008, public service numbers increased by almost 15%, tracking increases in annual public expenditure levels that have come to define that era.  As we know now, this was unsustainable, and it hardly represents a sensible benchmark for public services for the future. </font></p><p><font color="#181818">- There was also an unprecedented economic and fiscal crisis which threatened the sustainability of the public finances.  This required difficult decisions to reduce public service pay rates and public service numbers, among many other difficult decisions.  These were delivered in co-operation with the staff unions, under a series of critically important industrial relations agreements and in tandem with specific sectoral reform measures.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">- Finally, there has been a wide ranging reform agenda, which I launched in 2011, and it has delivered efficiencies and enhanced the effectiveness of public services.  At the heart of the Reform Agenda is a commitment to drive change and continuous improvements to outdated practices and service delivery models in order to protect and enhance key public services.  The introduction of shared services, automation of processes across many areas, and changes to work practices means that more is being done with less.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  It is on this more secure and reformed foundation that I have been willing and able to increase staffing levels across key sectors, which the Government can be more assured will impact directly on improved service levels for people.</font><font color="#181818">  </font></p></reply>

There has been a concern in recent years about the deteriorating condition of the Crosses and, as the Deputy mentions, there is evidence of some accelerated weather and environmental erosion on some of the panels of the West and South Crosses in particular.  Understanding that there was a clear risk to the Monuments, the Office of Public Works carried out a detailed technical study of the Crosses during 2014 and presented the lead Department involved, the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with a full assessment of the issues involved together with some options for them to consider.  Following a full assessment of this report, the Department has recently instructed the Office of Public Works to pursue the option of <i>in situ</i>enclosure of the West and South Crosses within structures that will provide the necessary environmental protection for the future.  Additionally, as a first step, the OPW is instructed to complete a detailed 3D laser scan of the structures to establish their current condition and point to weaknesses in the fabric.  This work is under way currently.  The proposed erection of an environmental shelter for the Crosses will be, in itself, a complex and challenging undertaking.  There are a number of international comparators for a project such as this.  The OPW is evaluating the options available and consulting with relevant authorities who have undertaken similar works elsewhere before deciding how best to proceed.  Once a viable plan has been devised, the project will proceed under the joint management of the OPW and DAHG.</p><p>In the short term, and to protect the Crosses from the worst of the Winter weather, the OPW is considering the provision of a temporary cover for the crosses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-19a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015111900052#WRA01900"><p>Neither my Department nor the Office of Public Works (OPW) have any function in relation to the oversight or regulation of insurance matters.  The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers.  Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  The OPW is the lead State body for the management of flood risk in Ireland.  Over the past 20 years, it has invested over &euro;410 million on flood protection measures in major urban areas together with investment in many minor works projects to address more localised flooding problems.  The Government's Capital Investment Plan 2016&ndash;2021, includes a &euro;430 million investment in flood defence measures to build on the work already done.</p>  <p>  With such State investment in flood protection, it is right to expect that insurance cover will be available.  In March 2014, the OPW and Insurance Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding intended to facilitate, as far as possible, the availability of insurance against flood risk.  The OPW is committed to providing Insurance Ireland with detailed data on completed OPW flood defence schemes.  Insurance companies will then take this data into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas. </p>  <p>  The Deputy has referred to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme.  Under this Programme, the OPW is producing detailed flood maps for 300 communities at potentially significant risk from flooding.  Following an extensive series of public consultation days, a statutory public consultation on these maps will commence tomorrow and run until 23 December 2015.  These maps are draft and I have ensured that the insurance sector has been informed that they cannot be relied upon to inform insurance premiums, policies or excesses.  When finalised, these maps will inform the development of Flood Risk Management Plans, due by the end of 2016, on how best to address the flood risk in each of these areas.  These plans will inform decisions on future investment on flood risk management.</p>  <p>  Policy in relation to flood insurance is amongst the policy areas being considered by an Interdepartmental Committee that is developing for Government, by early Spring 2016, the whole-of-government policies and measures to support the OPW Flood Risk Management Plans, to help individuals and communities prepare, plan and protect their properties and communities against flooding. </p></reply>

In addition, under the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the role assigned to "relevant Minister" as defined in that Act, is now the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of The Institute of Public Administration Superannuation Fund, the Economic and Social Research Institute Pension Plan, and the Economic and Social Research Institute Superannuation Plan. All of these schemes are currently operated on a pay-as-you-go basis and as such no deficits arise.  I have no current plans for consolidation of these schemes.</p>  <p>  An effective consolidation of public service pension schemes will in any event be achieved over time by way of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which I launched on 1 January 2013.  The Single Scheme applies to all areas of public service employment, and is now the default pension scheme for first-time new-joiner public servants.  In general the only new-joiner public service personnel who can be enrolled in pre-Single Scheme public service schemes are those with a recent work history elsewhere in the public service.

The implementation of a medium term budgetary framework and the introduction of wide-scale reviews of public expenditure with the Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure allow for greater consideration and debate about key challenges facing public expenditure. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), which was established in 2012, is an integrated cross-Government service which enhances the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policy making.  IGEES staff operate in designated economic evaluation units and engage widely with other Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The revised Public Spending Code, which sets out the economic appraisal requirements for new current and capital expenditure proposals, brings together in one place all of the elements of the value-for-money framework that has been in force up to now, updated and reformed in some respects.  The Code is maintained on my Department's website under the management of the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit (CEEU) as a resource for the entire Irish public service.  In September 2013, Departments and Offices were formally notified by circular that the Public Spending Code is in effect.  Departments/Agencies proposing the expenditure are generally responsible for undertaking the required appraisal for each new spending proposal or project.  It provides that appraisals and detailed assessments should be carried out before Exchequer resources are committed. </p>  <p>  In July 2015, the Government agreed a new three-year Value for Money Review Programme for each Department.  Under the programme, Departments will review expenditure across a number of programme areas.  This Programme which is reviewing 40 topics is aligned with the multi-annual budgetary cycle, and the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will, of course, be aware the Oireachtas itself and its Committees also plays a central role in seeking to ensure that the expenditure of State resources occurs in the best interest of the general public.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.

The report titled &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013&quot; contained positive news for Irish businesses and SMEs.  The EU definition of a SME was used in this analysis.

In order to encourage greater SME participation the OGP is working with industry representative bodies to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  </font></p><p><font color="#181818">This year, for example, the OGP supported two 'Meet the Buyer' events - one in Belfast and the other in Dublin, Go To Tender workshops and Taking Care of Business events with a combined attendance in excess of 2,000 businesses.

These contributions entitle them to access social insurance benefits, including State pension (contributory), widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory), guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.</p>  <p>  In its 2013 report, the Advisory Group on Tax and Social examined issues relating to the provision of social insurance cover for the self-employed on a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context.  </p>  <p>  The Group was not convinced that there was a need to extend cover for jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed.  The Group did, however, find that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted, in cases related to long term sickness or injuries, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  </p>  <p>  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  Based on the 2010 report on the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund an increase in the region of 17% would be required for the core contributory State pension plus invalidity pension for the self-employed.  This takes account of the 15% needed to provide the core full-rate State pension. </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group considered the issue of allowing self-employed persons pay extra contributions to access benefits on an optional basis.  The Group recommended against it as allowing people to opt in or out could lead to the selection of bad risks.  It therefore recommended that any extension of social insurance to the self-employed should be on a compulsory basis.</p></reply>

One of the PRSI conditions is that a person must have a minimum of 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Claims made in 2015 are governed by the 2013 tax year, and only PRSI classes A, E, H, and P contributions are reckonable for illness benefit purposes.   The person concerned does not satisfy the above criteria.</p>  <p>  Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay-related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  To qualify for IP claimants must have at least 260 paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last complete contribution year before the date of their claim. Only PRSI classes A, E or H contributions are reckonable for IP purposes.  From the information available to my Department, it appears that the person concerned does not satisfy the PRSI contribution criteria for IP.   </p>  <p>  However entitlement to IP can only be definitively determined on receipt of a completed claim form. </p>  <p>  Disablement benefit is one of the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme to an insured person who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an occupational accident or prescribed occupational disease. The person must have been in insurable employment at the time the accident or the disease was contracted. The person concerned has made two applications for disablement benefit:</p>  <p>  - The first application was received on 20 April 2007 in respect of an accident at work on 21 Sep 2006. The person concerned has been awarded disablement benefit from 23 March 2007 with a loss of faculty of 20% for life. This is currently in payment.</p>  <p>  - The second alleged accident occurred on 23 May 2006 in respect of a commuter accident on his way to work. This application was received in the department on 2 April 2015. This claim is still under investigation. The person concerned will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  According to my Department&rsquo;s records, the person concerned is currently in receipt of disability allowance at the maximum rate for their circumstances.</p></reply>

These contributions provide cover for long-term social insurance benefits including the State pension (contributory) and the widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension.  They do not provide access to benefits such as treatment benefits which include a contribution towards the cost of hearing aids.  In contrast a combined employer and employee rate of 14.75% is paid in respect of most employees, who can then access the full range of social insurance benefits, including treatment benefits.</p><p>The most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012 found that, in the case of the self-employed with earnings equivalent to national average earnings, a 15% contribution rate would be needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory) to the self-employed.  This compares very favourably with the 4% currently paid by the self-employed.  The Review also showed highlighted that the self-employed at all income levels got better value for money for their contributions in relation to the State pension<i></i>than employees generally.</p><p>While I am anxious to expand the level of social insurance entitlement for the self-employed, any such change would have to be funded by an appropriate level of contribution.</p></reply>

This increase is driven by positive contributions from both average hourly wages as well as the number of hours worked. Furthermore, employment volumes are also expected to rise in line with a strengthening of labour market conditions. As a result, the whole-economy total pay bill (i.e. incorporating total employment gains and increases in earnings per worker) is projected to grow by an average of approximately 4.5 per cent per annum over the medium term horizon.</p><p>Broad-based increases in income are expected, with positive contributions from both the public and private sectors. The public pay bill is projected to grow at over the medium-term horizon. This outlook incorporates provisions for the Lansdowne Road Agreement for the years to 2018.</p><p>In addition to labour income, the current medium term outlook for profit income remains positive. As is typical in a cyclical upturn, profit income, which includes self-employed profits, has lead wage growth. Profit income is also set to continue to record robust growth over the medium term. This is primarily driven by a pickup in domestic trading profits. </p><p>Increases in income are, of course, contingent upon achieving sustainable economic growth in the years ahead. This, in turn, is predicated on inter-alia continued gains in competitiveness and ensuring sustainable public finances. </p></reply>

In the course of this year, Revenue has strengthened its focus on the sector and its national programme of compliance interventions in relation to tax and the construction sector in general. Revenue's focus includes:-</p><p>Proper operation of the eRCT system including ensuring that principal contractors are fully reporting payments through the eRCT system and ensuring that principal contractors are reporting &quot;Unknown&quot; sub-contractors to Revenue;</p><p>Reconciling reported activity under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) with VAT returns filed;</p><p>Reconciling reported activity under the eRCT system, PAYE/PRSI returns, VAT returns and examining profit margins;</p><p>Proper operation of the VAT reverse charge; </p><p>Proper operation of PAYE/PRSI obligations;</p><p>Ensuring that employees are not misclassified as sub-contractors;</p><p>Ensuring that obligations of non-principals/sub-contractors are being fully met.</p><p>Revenue has also increased the number of unannounced visits to construction sites.</p><p>If the Deputy has specific information relating to individuals or business groups in any sector who are involved in tax evasion, he should provide that information to Revenue.

The success of the sector has been driven by global specialisation in key fields such as funds management and administration, insurance and reinsurance and brokerage, efficient listing processes and the availability of highly qualified staff and professional support services.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank remains committed to seeking and communicating further detail on the nature of the International Financial Service activities listed or domiciled in Ireland and is engaged in improving data collection, levels of awareness and engagement with international regulators and bodies.</p></reply>

The additional levy of 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund <i>Jobs Initiative,</i>will also end after this year, as I again confirmed on Budget day last month.</p><p>The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the <i>Initiative </i>has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p><p>While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected as suggested in the details supplied. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.

To that end, the Central Bank has:</p>  <p>  -  signed contracts with CRIF Ireland Limited in February 2015 to establish and operate the CCR on its behalf;</p>  <p>  -  progressed a design stage to specify the detailed data requirements and conducted a data survey with representative lenders;</p>  <p>  -  published a Consultation Paper in April 2015 seeking views on key issues, in response to which 19 submissions were received in advance of the closing date of 12 June (in relation to this, the Central Bank will publish feedback in the coming months), and</p>  <p>  -  commenced a privacy impact assessment to ensure that the appropriate controls will be in place to safeguard personal data across the end to end processes.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the CCR solution design and on drafting the necessary regulations under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 to establish the legal basis for lenders to submit data to the register.  The take on of data will be implemented on a phased basis, with Phase 1 focusing on lending to consumers and Phase 2 focusing on lending to businesses.  It is expected that data submissions by lenders will commence in late 2016 but the final deadline will be influenced by the scale of the technical and operational changes to be implemented by lenders. Enquiries by lenders against the CCR data are likely to commence in early 2017 when data quality has been assured. Borrowers will be entitled to access their own credit reports at that time also. The provision of the CCR is a significant task and the commencement of full operations will depend on data submissions from over 500 lenders. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also advised me that, since the commencement of the project in late 2013, the costs it has incurred to end October 2015 have amounted to &euro;1,543,000.  However, it should be noted that the costs associated with the CCR will, in due course, be recovered from CCR users.</p></reply>

These proposals covered a number of issues across a range of Government Departments and State Bodies.  The Office of Public Works (OPW) responded to the Committee by way of a written reply in September 2012, both welcoming the Committee&rsquo;s Report and the OPW&rsquo;s approach to addressing the specific matters within the OPW's area of responsibility. </p>  <p>  The Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study is the Office of Public Works' core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon basin.  I am advised that good progress continues to be made on the Study.  A total of 66 locations along the Shannon, covering an area of 17,800 square kilometres, have been identified for further assessment under the Study, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW with the involvement of relevant local authorities. A programme of local public consultation days on the draft predictive flood mapping for these locations concluded in April 2015.  A national public consultation on the draft flood maps will commence tomorrow, 20 November and run until 23   December 2015. </p>  <p>  Further details on the Shannon CFRAM Study are available on the Study website www.shannoncframstudy.ie.  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.</p>  <p>  The Flood Risk Management Plans due to be completed by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis that takes into account social and environmental factors as well as economic criteria. </p></reply>

The latest figures in relation to the unemployment rate show that it has been reduced from a peak of 15.1% in February 2012 to 8.9% in October this year The fiscal strategy underpinning Budget 2016 is designed to encourage continued sustainable economic growth and increase investment in public services in order to promote further employment growth. Increased employment results in more resources being available to deliver public services.  It is of course important to ensure that those resources are being allocated to best effect. The range of reforms that have been introduced by my Department to the budgetary cycles and processes help to support the efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 includes a significant measure in relation to childcare which has a clear potential to contribute to improved competitiveness and higher trend economic growth.  The Early Childhood Care and Education scheme is to be extended. Investment in childcare will have both social and economic returns.  It acts as a key labour activation measure, particularly for women   allowing those who wish to work to take up work and it improves educational and social outcomes, by providing our children with the best possible start. In relation to capital expenditure, the Capital Plan recently published by my Department prioritises spending on those areas of greatest need as the economy continues its strong recovery.  </p>  <p>  My Department has played a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key fiscal targets in each year of the EU/IMF programme of financial support resulting in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013. Furthermore, as a result of the fiscal policies of this Government and the efforts of the Irish people, Ireland is due to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) at the end of this year. With this improved fiscal position the Government has been able to implement increases in expenditure this year and to target further increases in 2016. </p>  <p>  When framing Budget 2016 the Government was conscious of the need to continue to address the challenges that face Irish families. Our aim is to ensure that recovery is felt in every home and in every community across the country. With this in mind, resources were provided to allow for significant measures to be implemented across a number of sectors. An additional 2,260 teaching posts will be provided for in 2016 to cater for additional students, improve the staffing schedule and meet special education needs. A package of social protection measures was also introduced to protect some of the most vulnerable in society with increases in the State Pension as well as increases to Child Benefit and the Carer's Support Grant. </p>  <p>  With Ireland moving to the preventive arm of the SGP in 2016, sustainable expenditure policy will be anchored in the future by adherence to new fiscal rules which aim to help ensure Ireland makes progress towards its Medium Term Objective (MTO) which is a balanced budgets in structural terms. The Expenditure Benchmark, a complementary measure under the SGP, is designed to regulate the growth in public expenditure in line with the medium term potential growth rate of the economy, thereby making sure that the level of spending is sustainable and can continue to be supported by the economy. </p>  <p>  As the economy continues to recover we will look to build upon and intensify the significant and wide-ranging public service reforms implemented over recent years. These have added efficiency and effectiveness to the way in which our public services are delivered and will continue to play a key role in supporting the rebalancing of the public finances and releasing further funds for reinvestment in key public services in a manner consistent with continuing to meet our SGP obligations.  </p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles. There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement.  </p></reply>

Approximately 15 million additional hours have been provided by staff right across the Public Service. These reforms have contributed to the maintenance and enhancement of existing public services during a period of significant constraints on public expenditure and at a time when public services were under increasing demand.</p><p>Due to the difficult measures adopted and the resulting improvement in the economy, it has allowed the Government to commit additional resources and improve services in a number of key areas including the Health, Justice and Education sectors while remaining firmly within our fiscal parameters including meeting the GDP Deficit target of less than 3% in 2015. The significant improvement in the fiscal position has also enabled the Government to bring forward a series of proposals under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 to provide for  an ameliorisation and gradual unwinding of the fiscal emergency measures impacting on public servants with effect from 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

The primary duty of the Commission is to make recommendations to me each year regarding the national minimum hourly rate of pay, but it may also examine other related matters, at my request.</p><p>With effect from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2015, the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court were merged into a new Body of First Instance, known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).</p><p>In addition, the appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are now incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  From 1<sup>st</sup>October all complaints fall to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance, and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.  This heralds the biggest reorganisation of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations and employment machinery in almost 70 years and is the result of four years of reform driven by my Department.</p><p>A single Contact Portal and information service, workplacerelations.ie, a single complaint form replacing 30 individual complaint forms, and a process supported by a modern IT infrastructure ensures a better experience for all in need of assistance to resolve their employment grievances.</p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was established on 31<sup>st</sup>October 2014 as a result of the merger of the Competition Authority and National Consumer Agency.  The Commission has 5 members and has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law and will build on the work of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to protect and strengthen competition, empower consumers to make informed decisions and protect them from harmful business practices.</p><p>Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1<sup>st</sup>August 2014 under the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.  As part of this integration the functions of the Irish National Accreditation Board were transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>The transfer of enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and tourism functions to Bord F&aacute;ilte took place during the last quarter of 2013.  The legislation to merge Shannon Development and Shannon Airport into a new commercial state company, State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, was enacted on 27 July 2014.  Responsibility for the newly formed Shannon Group plc rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 15<sup>th</sup>April 2014, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards were dissolved under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014.  On the same date, 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established. Under the legislation, the functions, assets and liabilities were transferred to Enterprise Ireland (E.I.), and these functions are now being delivered on behalf of E.I. by the LEOs within the Local Authority structure. </p><p>In addition, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that, following enactment of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, Microfinance Ireland was established as a private limited company in August 2012, as a subsidiary of the Social Finance Foundation and has charitable status.  </p><p>Microfinance Ireland has been funded by the Government to provide loans to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p><p>None of the above bodies are subject to sunset clauses.</p><p>My Department does not have any current plans to establish any new Public Bodies.</p></reply>

The fishing opportunities available to vessels, including within the Irish Exclusive Fishery Zone (EFZ) for 2015 are set out in TAC and Quota Regulation on a stock by stock basis (Council Regulation (EU) 104/2015 dated 19 January 2015 as amended by Council Regulation 2015/523 of 25 March 2015, Council Regulation 2015/960 of 19<sup>th</sup>June and Council Regulation 2015/1961 of 26 October). In addition to the TACs and quotas set down each year by the Fisheries Council, under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a Member State may also swap (exchange) quotas with other Member States in a particular year. Details of fishing opportunities available to Member States in EU waters in recent years are available on the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG website, using the following link </p><p>Lithuania has received a swop for 2015 in respect of Horse Mackerel in ICES area VI, VII, receiving that quota from another Member State, which may be fished in ICES Areas VI and VII which includes Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is provided on FIDES, the official EU Database of fishing opportunities. The FIDES database shows that Lithuania has a quota of 644 tonnes of Mackerel in ICES Zones VI, VII, VIb, XIb of which 544 tonnes has been caught. Lithuania also has a quota of 5,953 tonnes of Horse Mackerel in IIa, IVa, VI, VIIa-c, VIIe-k, VIIIa, VIIIb, VIIId, VIIIe of which 4,085 tonnes has been caught. </p><p>All fishing opportunities set down in the TAC and Quota Regulation each year are determined by the EU Fisheries Council based on the scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES, in providing advice, considers all of the available data including catch and landing data supplied by the Member States and data provided by Member States scientific bodies, in Ireland&rsquo;s case &ndash; the Marine Institute. The collection and transmission of catch and landings data is mandatory. Member States are also responsible for the collection of scientific data in accordance with EU Data Collection provisions. </p><p>Under Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the CFP basic regulation), changes to fisheries policy involving access or restriction to fishing opportunities or fishing areas come within the sole competency of the EU. Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council. Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation. However, access to the 12 mile zone is set down in the CFP Regulation and may not be changed by an individual Member State. </p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1<sup>st</sup>of January 2015. The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group. <b></b>A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries. These draft recommendations have been sent to the Pelagic Advisory Council and the North Western Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380/2013) for their observations. When these are received, the draft recommendations will be considered by the NWW Member States Group. </p><p>Control of the vessel within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone is as a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating the area.  The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement. </p></reply>

In 2008 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators (including honey bees) for Irish food crops was worth at least &euro;53m.  This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild.  The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.

With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act.  American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014).  While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland.  In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year.  This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.  Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme.  Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved.  A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.  My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow.  Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected.  Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations.  The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees.  In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.  Direct imports of bees into Ireland from outside the EU are not permitted although imports from other EU Member States which fulfil the EU&rsquo;s bee health certification requirements are permitted.</p></reply>

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China.  In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.  On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export.  I am advised that the UK are currently experiencing similar challenges.</p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat.  I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat.  In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.  The SFPA followed up the notification last week with face-to-face discussions with crab industry to communicate the challenges the application of this standard presents.</p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue.  With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has attempted to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks, so far without success.  The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies.  In order to provide additional support to the SFPA in preparing its technical response, a further meeting between the crab industry, the relevant state agencies (Bord Bia, Marine Institute and BIM), my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is being convened this week.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels.  It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk.  I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.</p></reply>

It is an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1963 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as for any public official, to disclose official information without lawful authority.  It is also, quite separately, a distinct offence under section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make an unauthorised disclosure of information obtained in the course of duty if the member knows that such disclosure is likely to have a harmful effect.  The section  sets out a list of instances of harmful effect covered by this offence, which include, for example, a disclosure which results in the identification of a person whose identity is not at the time of the disclosure a matter of public knowledge or which results in the publication of personal information constituting an unwarranted and serious infringement of a person's right to privacy.  The penalty for such an offence, upon conviction on indictment, is a term of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a maximum fine of &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes its responsibility for the control of the information it possesses about individuals very seriously.  Unauthorised disclosure of information can impede the investigation of an offence and the apprehension or prosecution of suspected offenders as well as being unfair to individuals </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware I, as Minister, have no investigative functions.  There are independent statutory agencies who are empowered to carry out such investigations.</p>  <p>  In that context it is worth stating that any member of the public who believes that he or she has been the subject of unauthorised disclosure of information by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may make a complaint to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has extensive powers of investigation. </p></reply>

I welcome the coming into force of the  European Union Victims Directive on 16 November. I believe that the Directive represents a significant change in the way that victims will be dealt with as they make their way through the criminal justice system. It provides for information to be given to victims from first contact with the criminal justice agencies. It provides for much additional information to be given in the course of the investigation and court process if the person opts in to receive that information. This is key to empowering victims. </p><p>The Directive also provides that victims of crime will be able to receive an individual assessment to identify victim&rsquo;s specific protection needs; access victim support services; enjoy safeguards in the context of restorative justice services; access protection and enjoy privacy in the context of the criminal proceedings.</p><p>The criminal justice agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions,  have been working to provide a service to victims in line with the standard set out in the Victims Directive. </p><p>I also secured an extra 21% for the 2016 budget to fund services to victims of crime via a scheme administered by the Victims of Crime Office in my Department which will assist those organisations in implementing the Directive.</p><p>As well as the administrative policies and procedures already put in place by various criminal justice agencies to give effect to the Directive, legislation to transpose the Victims Directive into Irish law is currently being drafted as a priority in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is expected to be published shortly and it will be enacted as soon as possible after that. </p><p>In terms of the injuries received in circumstances of a criminal nature, I wish to inform the Deputy of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which administers the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. The Tribunal considers applications from people who suffer a personal injury or death as a result of a crime of violence. <i>Ex gratia</i>compensation may be awarded on the basis of any vouched out of pocket expenses, including loss of earnings, experienced by the victim or, if the victim has died as a result of the incident, by the dependants of the victim. Further information and copies of the Scheme's application forms may found on my Department's website and can be accessed via the following website <b></b>.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the health services received by the individual concerned, my colleague, the Minister for Health, has arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact the Minister for Health's Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE. </p><p>Finally, I have asked the Garda Commissioner for a report in relation to the particular case referred to by the Deputy . I will reply further to the Deputy when that information becomes available.</p></reply>

In this regard, &euro;32.471m in funding was provided in 2015.  </p><p>The Board operates 30 full-time and 12 part-time law centres across twenty six counties. In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011, which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point. A key reason for this transfer was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. </p><p>The Dolphin House initiative, set up in 2011, operating from the District Court in Dolphin House and involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre, has proven successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014. Similar initiatives are now operating from Cork, Naas, Limerick, Clonmel and Nenagh. Integration of the Family Mediation Service into the Legal Aid Board has also meant an increase in the referrals from Law Centres to mediation in appropriate cases.</p><p>My Department also provided &euro;98,000 in funding to the Free Legal Advice Centres Ltd (FLAC) in 2015.  FLAC currently provides legal information and advice through the 21 centres it administers directly as well as an additional 49 centres run through . </p><p>I recognise the value of the work that Community Law and Mediation are undertaking in the face of obvious financial pressures, and hope that this work will continue into the future. </p><p>In the context of the financial resources available to my Department and the various funding requirements across all areas of the Department, I am committed to allocating any additional resources that may become available towards the continuing funding of these bodies.  </p><p>I recognise the value of the work that Community Law and Mediation are undertaking in the face of obvious financial pressures, and hope that this work will continue into the future. </p></reply>

This gives a mandate for the commissioning of evidence based Parenting Support Programmes in all 17 Child and Family Agency local areas in conjunction with the Children and Young People Services Committees (CYPSC) which are led by the Agency's Area Managers.  This is in keeping with the High Level Policy Statement on supporting Parents and Families launched by me earlier this year in accordance with the commitment to do so in the Policy Framework.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency funds a range of Parenting Support Programmes including those with a focus on positive parenting, parenting &amp;amp; toddler services, Lifestart, Springboard projects, Parentline, the Marte Meo model, lone parent services and Treoir.  These are delivered through various entities including the large network of Family Resource Centres.</p><p>&lsquo;Supporting Parenting&rsquo; is a significant strand of work within the Prevention Partnership and Family Support Mainstreaming Programme within the Agency and partner organisations, which is funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.  &euro;340,000 will be available to the 17 Agency Areas in 2016-2017 to support &lsquo;Parental Participation&rsquo; practices.  Parental participation, first and foremost, is about supporting parents to participate positively in the care and education of their own children.  The Agency is committed to engaging with children, parents and communities about the design, delivery and quality of its services.  &lsquo;Shaping our Parenting Support through Participation&rsquo; is the theme of the Agency's first parenting conference in a series of three conferences to take place from December 2015 through to 2017.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency has further informed me that a comprehensive revision of structures and systems is currently under way to implement a new approach to Prevention Partnership and Family Support within the Agency.  This includes the appointment of senior managers for Prevention Partnership and Family Support as part of the Management Team of each Agency operational area; Child and Family Support Network Co-ordinators; and a Prevention Partnership and Family Support Steering Committee, to be a sub-group of CYPSC, where such a committee is in place.</p><p>&lsquo;Parenting24seven&rsquo; is a web based resource which is available on the Agency's website () and which has been developed with the support of partner organisations, most notably Childhood Development Initiative, Tallaght.  Included in Parenting24seven is a video on Positive Parenting which gives parents tips on managing behaviour positively. </p><p>An extensive evaluation of the Prevention Partnership and Family Support programme of work is being undertaken by the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre, NUI Galway.  This includes collecting baseline data on parenting supports and participatory practices. </p></reply>

In 2016 Tusla will have an overall budget of some &euro;676 m, which includes &euro;662.4 m in current funding and &euro;13.6 m in capital funding.  This is an increase of over 5% compared to the 2015 provision.  </p>  <p>  The very significant additional provision being allocated in 2016 will ensure that the organisation, which is still in its early stages of operation, will have a strong base level of funding in order to meet known and anticipated costs arising in 2016.  The increased level of funding is designed to assist Tusla in meeting identified service pressures and address areas of particular risk.  This includes the full year cost of service pressures experienced in 2015.  This level of provision addresses all of the key priorities identified by Tusla, and considered to be achievable in 2016.  It will give rise to a substantial recruitment programme involving up to 400 additional staff in the Agency next year.</p>  <p>  The increased capital provision will allow for a range of projects to be initiated and progressed including the development of new and improved special care facilities at Portrane and Ballydowd. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Agency's establishing legislation, my Department will be issuing a detailed Performance Statement to inform the preparation of Tusla's Business Plan for 2016.  This Statement will set out the key priorities that I will require of Tusla in the coming year.  I am very pleased that having asked Tusla for a detailed business case setting out the basis for seeking additional resources in 2016, I have been able to provide significant extra funding that will strengthen its funding base and secure the delivery of quality services.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.  The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

On this basis, the title of physiotherapist will be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.</p><p>I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of <i>physical therapist </i>under the Act.  In other English speaking countries, the title of <i>physical therapist </i>is often used by physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.</p><p>Earlier this year I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of <i>physical therapist </i>as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist </i>and invited them to submit their views.  The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year.  As you can appreciate there are many factors to consider.  However, I can assure the House that my main concern will be to protect the public when it comes to decisions on this matter.</p></reply>

The reform is not about privatising hospitals.  This Government does not support the privatisation of hospitals which will continue, in the main, to be funded by the public purse.  The majority of work will continue to be conducted by the public sector.</p>  <p>  In advance of the development of Trusts a strengthened Accountability Framework has been developed by the HSE, which includes specific targets across the Balanced Score Card of quality, access, finance and HR and timelines for achievement.  One of the most important elements of these accountability arrangements is a requirement that managers at each level ensure that any issues of underperformance are identified and addressed at the level where they occur.  Where there are issues of persistent underperformance, the HSE will implement a formal Performance Escalation, Support and Intervention process as part of its Accountability Framework.</p>  <p>  The key point to note here is that if Hospital Groups and Trusts are to have more authority and autonomy (to the extent that any organisation funded by public money can be), they will have to be more accountable.  Where hospitals fail to meet performance targets which others can and where the reasons are internal, as distinct from other causes, then this needs to be tackled.  The taxpayer legitimately expects results when their hard earned money is invested, whether in health or elsewhere.  When additional resources are invested, patients have a legitimate expectation that questions will be asked if improvements are not secured and actions taken.</p></reply>

Assistance is provided by the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive Department of the HSE and further information is available on the HSE's website. Access to treatment under the CBD is based on the referral of the treating clinician, therefore the HSE has concentrated on increasing awareness on this initiative amongst those clinicians. 18 public patients have received reimbursement for provision of their orthodontic care under the CBD in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area involves the up-skilling of one member of the dental hygienist staff and one member of the dental nursing staff to work as orthodontic therapists. Orthodontic therapists are dental healthcare professionals who carry out certain parts of orthodontic treatment work under the supervision of an orthodontist. It is intended that some of the work currently carried out by orthodontists would be carried out by orthodontic therapists, thereby enabling the orthodontic team to treat more patients.  </p>  <p>  Value for money is a key factor in the procurement process for the provision of certain orthodontic treatments by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE. Tenders are currently being evaluated and it is expected that contracts will be awarded by the end of 2015. The costs will be available after the process has been completed.</p></reply>

Health Identifiers are also essential to underpin the modernisation and eHealth agendas for the operation of a high quality health service.  The Health Identifiers Act 2014 provides the legislative basis for the introduction of a system of identifiers for recipients of a health service as well as healthcare providers, both professionals and organisations. </p><p>Section 7 of the Act provides that the Minister may use particulars obtained by him or her or by the HSE before or after the coming into operation of the Section for the purposes of assigning individual health identifiers and for establishing and maintaining the National Register of Individual Health Identifiers.  Section 8 of the Act provides that a Minister of the Government may provide information to the Minister for Health for the purposes of establishing or maintaining the accuracy of the National Register of Individual Health Identifiers.  Therefore, the Act provides that the Register can be populated from various data sources on an ongoing basis to ensure data quality, accuracy and completeness and it is intended to exploit and reuse the significant investment in data collection and verification being made by the Minister for Social Protection in the Public Service Card initiative.  The Data Protection Commissioner was consulted while the Health Identifiers Act was being drafted and will be consulted at appropriate stages of the implementation. </p><p>The Health Identifiers Act 2014 (Delegation of Relevant Functions) Order 2015 delegates the day-to-day operation of the system of health identifiers to the HSE. </p><p>The operation of the health identifier registers will be underpinned by a  robust governance framework which will be informed by the Privacy Impact Assessment on the identifiers currently being carried out by HSE in addition to the <i>Information Governance and Management Standards for the Health Identifier Operator in Ireland</i>that HIQA has recently submitted to me for approval.</p><p>No legislation amending the Data Protection Acts on the transfer of personal or other data was introduced in the Oireachtas by me or my predecessors during the period in question.</p></reply>

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  </p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, additional funding of &euro;8 million is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is expected before the end of 2016.  The HSE has been asked to prepare detailed proposals on the employment of this additional resource.</p></reply>

As Minister D&eacute;sir himself pointed out, the French people were the ones attacked, but the whole of Europe, its values and freedoms are threatened, and European solidarity and cohesion are vital to the response.  I stressed the Irish Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to working with France and EU partners to protect Europe&rsquo;s citizens and safeguard our values against further terrorist attacks.</p>  <p>  In the discussion on migration, Member States stressed the importance of not linking the issues of migration and terrorism.  As regards the EU&rsquo;s engagement with Turkey, there was general agreement that Turkey is an important strategic partner for the European Union across the broad range of international cooperation, including migration.  There was also unanimous welcome for the outcome of the Valletta Summit, where it was agreed to establish a Trust Fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa.</p>  <p>  The Council also discussed the Middle East Peace Process, in particular the recent visits of HRVP Mogherini and EU Special Representative Gentilini, which explored the possibility for a resumption of political talks at this time.  Ministers also discussed the unrest and violence during the last two months, and also the publication by the European Commission of an interpretative notice on indications of origin of produce from Israeli settlements.  In my intervention, I addressed the violence on the ground, the need for a response wider than just security measures, which would address also the underlying issues. I also stressed the need for concrete actions and improvements, particularly in relation to Gaza and to Area C.  The discussion is expected to continue at the December Council.</p>  <p>  The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, also briefed Foreign Ministers on the outcome of the discussions of the International Support Group in Vienna on Saturday 14 November and the prospects for a political resolution to the conflict.</p></reply>

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>  Under the Equal Status Act schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. </p><p>The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p><p>Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Department's website or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit at 0761 108584 or by emailing section29@education.gov.ie.</p><p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The EWS can be contacted at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year, provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p><p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation. </p><p>The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

The Act provides a robust regulatory framework for, inter alia, the licensing, monitoring and inspection of dog breeding establishments by local authorities and, where a serious and immediate threat exists to public health or animal health and welfare, for the closure of such establishments.  A joint inspection regime of dog breeding establishments, involving officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Local Authority Veterinary Service, was introduced earlier this year.  Inspections are ongoing and necessary follow up action is taken as appropriate.  The discovery of individual problematic dog breeding establishments, and the taking of action by the Garda&iacute;, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authorities in an integrated manner in the most serious cases, would suggest the legislation is effective and I have no plans to amend it at this time.</p></reply>

The Mortgage to Rent Scheme is not intended as a solution for the vast majority of arrears cases.  The transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families.  The Scheme relies on the financial institutions to propose suitable properties, with the Housing Agency making a determination as to whether the agreed eligibility criteria have been met.  The financial viability of particular transactions, for either the lenders or the AHBs, are commercial decisions to be taken by the individual bodies concerned.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s on-going process of engagement with the relevant stakeholders involved in the operation of the Scheme, a protocol between all stakeholders was agreed and came into operation in June 2014. The protocol is intended to minimise delays in the process; to ensure that the borrower is involved from the outset; and is kept informed of progress throughout.  A key objective of the protocol is to ensure that cases which are unlikely to be financially viable for the parties concerned are identified as early in the process as possible and withdrawn from further consideration.  Such cases would generally include instances where the funding available to the AHB would not support the purchase of the property unless a discount in excess of 15% of the Open Market Value (OMV) was provided by the lender.  However, the protocol provides that such cases can be considered by a lender should they so wish.</p>  <p>  The package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015 included a number of amendments to the AHB Mortgage to Rent Scheme which will enable more properties to qualify for the Scheme, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Amendments made with effect from 1 July 2015 include increases in the valuation thresholds for properties, flexibility in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme and amendments made to allow borrowers with marginal positive equity to be considered.  In addition, the financial support available to AHBs for Mortgage to Rent cases has been increased.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the Scheme under review.</p></reply>

The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.  The LAMTR scheme is similar to the Mortgage to Rent scheme for borrowers with mortgages from private commercial lending institutions, insofar as it also targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The LAMTR Scheme also ensures that the family remains in their home and ownership is transferred to a local authority rather than to an approved housing body as is the case under the Mortgage to Rent scheme in the private lending sector.  Therefore, the family becomes a tenant of the local authority under the LAMTR scheme.  Eligibility requirements under both schemes are in line with other forms of social housing support.</p><p>Funding for the Scheme is secured through the annual Estimates process.  The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme is demand - led and actual expenditure across local authorities amounted to approximately &euro;6.4m in 2014.  A list of the funds drawn down by Local Authority in 2014 is set out below.  A budget allocation of &euro;8m was provided in 2015, of which &euro;5.8m has been drawn-down by local authorities to date in 2015.  A total of &euro;17m has been provided for Mortgage to Rent Schemes (both Local Authority and Approved Housing Bodies Schemes) in 2016.</p><p>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) is being implemented across all local authorities.  My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014. Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities is available on my Department&rsquo;s website by clicking on the following link:</p><p>In cases of acute mortgage arrears distress, all homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority. Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.</p><p><b>Funds drawn down by local authorities under the LAMTR scheme in 2014:</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Amount</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>&euro;156,621 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>&euro;143,830 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>&euro;75,905 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City </td><td>&euro;4,123,139 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>&euro;291,109 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>&euro;120,648 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>&euro;80,631 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>&euro;151,525 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>&euro;101,500 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>&euro;66,803 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>&euro;986,307 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>&euro;100,230 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;6,398,248 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Amendments in relation to rent will extend the period between reviews of rent; extend the minimum period of notice of new rent; and introduce new requirements in relation to the notification of new rent.  The Bill also introduces a number of measures to enable the Private Residential Tenancies Board ( PRTB) to deal effectively with tenants who do not comply with their obligations, including the obligation to pay rent.  In addition to this, the Bill will address an issue that has been a cause of concern to landlords by providing that a minor error or defect in a Notice of Termination, that is an error or defect not prejudicial to the tenant, would not invalidate the Notice.</p><p>Furthermore, the Bill provides that in future, PRTB Determination Orders will be enforced in the District Court rather than the Circuit Court. This will considerably reduce the expense of enforcing a determination order and should also provide for faster hearings and better enforcement of, for example, rent arrears and anti-social behaviour cases. Finally,<b></b>tax relief measures, to be introduced in the Finance Bill, will allow landlords who lease to tenants in receipt of social housing supports such as rent supplement or the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to avail of 100% mortgage interest relief on their borrowings where they commit to accommodating tenants in receipt of the above payments for a minimum period of 3 years.</p><p>Taken together, I believe that these measures are a proportionate and balanced response to the current difficulties being experienced in the private rented sector. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with Committee Stage in the Seanad, and will return to the Seanad for Report Stage on Tuesday 24 November<i>.</i></p></reply>

The LGMA also took on the residual functions of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, which has dissolved as of 1 November 2012.  The LGMA is a central resource for the local government sector, providing, procuring and coordinating a range of support services and expertise which are most appropriately and efficiently delivered on a shared service basis at national level.</p>  <p>  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA) was formally established in 2012. It rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR).

Better Energy Homes provides grant aid to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.  Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures including attic insulation, wall insulation, heating systems upgrades, solar thermal panels and accompanying BER.</p>  <p>  My Department and the SEAI continue to monitor ways to improve the Better Energy Homes Scheme, while ensuring that the highest standards of governance and fiscal controls are maintained.  Contractors are not permitted to apply for the grant on behalf of the home owner. However, it is open to the home owner to nominate the bank account they wish to receive payment of the grant, which may be the account of the contractor. </p>  <p>  In addition, the SEAI has partnered with energy suppliers to provide additional support to home owners to access the Better Energy Homes though appointed service providers.  These service providers undertake to carry out all the work associated with applying for a grant on behalf of the homeowner. This involves: applying on-line, submitting all required documentation and forms, submitting the grant payment request to the SEAI and receiving the grant payment directly into its bank account. The homeowner pays for the balance of the cost of the works directly to the relevant service provider.</p>  <p>  In 2015 a Voice of the Customer process was initiated by SEAI. This allows homeowners to provide feedback directly to the SEAI on how to improve the Better Energy Homes scheme and associated processes.

The contract covers the design of the Eircode, encoding public sector databases, accessing the GeoDirectory database, the launch and implementation of Eircode and the on-going management of the system for the licence period.  Capita do not hold any personal data on the Eircode database or Eircode Finder. It includes business names, which in some cases can refer to an individual, particularly for small businesses or sole traders. The Eircode database is based on information received from An Post GeoDirectory. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation process an address matching exercise was carried out on public sector databases. The purpose of this exercise was to populate key government databases with postcodes prior to launch. Approximately 80 million records were encoded, none of which contained personal data.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I introduced a short piece of legislation to clarify the position in respect of Eircodes and data protection issues. The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Amendment Act 2015 provides protection for specified legitimate postcode activities to be carried out. The exercise of these activities is fundamental to the establishment and implementation of the postcode project. An example of a legitimate postcode activity would be the creation or management, by the postcode contractor, of a postcode database providing that the database only includes the fields containing the postcode, geo-coordinate, address or a variation of address, and even then only in certain limited circumstances. </p></reply>

Details can be found on the following link:  .</p><p>Following this Call, I understand that another CEF transport call for non-cohesion Member States may not arise until 2018. The majority of the direct provision CEF-transport budget for non-cohesion Member States(&euro;9.08 billion) will be allocated under this call and the previous Call. </p><p>The future budget for CEF-transport co-funding for non-cohesion Member States will involve a review of progress on existing CEF projects and recycling of monies not being spent in accordance with project milestones and within the timeframe of 2014-2020. It is thus not possible to make  exact statement of future calls for proposals and budgets for this programme. </p><p>I and my officals will continue to work with agencies under the remit of my Department and other Irish Organisations in advocating and facilitating suitable projects for direct provision co-funding and other financial instruments under CEF-transport.</p><p>CEF-transport projects are administered for DG Move by Innovation and Executive Agency (INEA) independently of individual Member States .</p><p>Under Interreg IV (SEUPB)  EU funding was used for the Enterprise Refurb/Drogheda Viaduct rail project.</p><p>The new INTERREG Programme (VA) for 2014-2020 is one of 60 programmes across the European Union designed to promote greater levels of cross-border co-operation. Northern Ireland, the Border Region of Ireland and Western Scotland share a number of common features with other border areas across Europe where developmental problems are exacerbated by the existence of borders. The Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport is the lead Department for the Sustainable Transport measure.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.   The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) provides funding for road and laneways that councils have not taken in charge.  That is, private roads and landways, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner. </p>  <p>  The LIS for regional and local roads remains in place but my Department does not provide a separate grant allocation towards this scheme.  Instead local authorities may use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  Where local authorities elect to operate the LIS, applicatons are made directly to the local authority and my Department does not have details of the individual applications or the costs involved.  The annual outputs provided to my Department by local authorities outline the overall number and cost of LIS schemes funded by local authorities.  The 2014 returns indicate that 93 LIS projects were undertaken at a total cost of &euro;1.35 million with funding of &euro;1.1 million provided by local authorities. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to revise the current arrangement. I take the view that local authorities are best placed to assess whether funding should be allocated to LIS.</p></reply>
