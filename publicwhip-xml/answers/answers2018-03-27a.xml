    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700058#WRA01000"><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Tracker Examination is focused on ensuring that lenders provide fair outcomes for all customers impacted by tracker related failings.  As part of the Examination framework, where customer detriment has been identified, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to impacted customers in line with its prescribed Principles for Redress.  The provision of redress is intended to return impacted customers to the position that they would have been in had the relevant issue not arisen and the compensation, which is to be reasonable, must reflect the detriment involved arising from and/or associated with being on an incorrect rate. Such compensation is to reflect the specific circumstances of each impacted customer.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Principles for Redress also set out that the lender is to provide impacted customers with an additional payment to allow them to take independent legal or other professional advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them. This additional payment is to be commensurate with the complexity of the advice required by the impacted customer depending on the individual circumstances of the impacted customer&rsquo;s case. </p>  <p>  Another important part of the Examination Framework is the requirement for lenders to establish independent Appeals Panels, specifically to deal with customers who are not satisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers that they receive from lenders.  The appeals process is additional to the options of bringing a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or initiating court proceedings.  Importantly customers can also accept the redress and compensation offered and still make an appeal to the independent appeals panels. Customers&rsquo; rights to make appeals to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and through the courts are also preserved.</p></reply>

Total assets have increased consistently for many years and currently stand at approximately &euro;16.8 billion. </p>  <p>  There are other areas where support has been provided including the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and the availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo which oversaw 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions during its lifetime.  These newly merged credit unions are now better positioned to harness the efficiencies of their increased scale to prudently develop products and services that their members are looking for now, and into the future.  </p>  <p>  In addition revised regulations for credit unions commenced on 1st March 2018 which make changes to the investment and liquidity requirements and allow for greater diversification of investment income, including provision for up to &euro;700 million investment in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies.</p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and its priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall.  The Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  Credit unions are member owned and it is these members, with support from their representative bodies, who ultimately are responsible for setting and implementing their own individual strategic plans, with appropriate support from Government, which reflect the diverse nature of credit unions be they urban or rural, large or small, industrial or community.</p></reply>

The report is available on the department&rsquo;s website and provides details of the total number of loans/value of loans owned by unregulated entities as at the end of June 2016.</p>  <p>  Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank. In July 2015, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.</p>  <p>  I should also refer to the Deputy&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill which was discussed in the D&aacute;il on 6 March and which seeks to increase consumer protections when loans are sold by requiring the regulation of loan owners by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to supporting the passage of this legislation and my officials are actively working to resolve the drafting challenges presented by the legislation in its current form.  I understand that a meeting will be held with the Deputy this week. </p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm which bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo;.  Credit Servicing Firms are required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank in order to conduct credit servicing activities as defined in the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank including the SME Regulations 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700058#WRA01600"><p>NAMA was established in December 2009 and its debts of nearly &euro;32 billion represented a substantial contingent liability to the State.</p>  <p>  The State recapitalised the domestic banking system at a gross cost of &euro;64 billion, adding around 40 per cent of GDP to national debt.  As a result of this, as well as the mismanagement of the public finances, total government debt now stands at over &euro;200 billion; this is the equivalent of over &euro;40,000 for every man, woman and child in the State.</p>  <p>  My priority, therefore, is to use revenue windfalls to reduce the debt incurred by public support for the banking system.</p>  <p>  Moreover, I am also very conscious that the economy is approaching full employment and it is important that the stance of budgetary policy reflects this - I will not adopt pro-cyclical policies that endanger our recovery.</p>  <p>  NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3bn to be returned to the State once it completes its work. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's senior and subordinated debt has been redeemed in full. NAMA announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in senior debt, which was guaranteed by the State, but &euro;1.6bn of subordinated debt is still outstanding.</p>  <p>  In order to keep the activities of NAMA off-balance sheet, a special purpose vehicle or SPV was established and it holds the debt. The State owns 49% of the SPV, through another entity called NAMA, with the other 51% privately owned.  From a statistical perspective, once the senior debt, subordinated debt, and private investors have been repaid then the State would be the sole shareholder and the NAMA SPV would then become classified into the general government sector, having no effect on the general government balance. This is expected to occur in 2020 and at that point in time NAMA will have no debt.</p>  <p>  Under the European System of Accounts 2010, any NAMA surplus paid to the Exchequer will be considered a financial transaction. So while it will be Exchequer positive, it will not impact the general government balance.  Therefore any resulting expenditure will worsen both the general government and the structural balances.  Whether such expenditure would be compatible with the limits set by the expenditure benchmark can only be determined under the conditions that prevail at the time.</p></reply>

At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system. However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose.  Due to the State&rsquo;s substantial holdings in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of BOI at the time) it was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>Section 396C was repealed to:</p><p>-  Reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital.</p><p>-  Protect the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments.</p><p>With the removal of Section 396C, AIB and BOI were restored to the same position as other Irish corporates including other Irish banks which effectively levelled the playing field.</p><p>To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016. In Budget 2017, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It is anticipated that the bank levy could be expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.</p><p>As I have previously stated, I do not intend to change how tax losses are currently taxed for Irish banks, including those that were bailed out by the State, as I believe there could be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system.  Concerns I have in making such changes include:</p><p>-  A weakened capital position for each of the banks that we have an investment in.</p><p>-  The valuation of our investments are likely to be materially impacted.</p><p>-  Damage to our credibility in international markets </p><p>I would also note recent media reports regarding proposals to recommend legislation that would limit the use of tax losses in banks to a ten-year period.  At the time local stockbrokers estimated that such a change would have a material negative impact on the value of both AIB and PTSB of 3% and 8% respectively which equates to a combined reduction in the value of the State&rsquo;s holding in the two banks of over &euro;300m.</p></reply>

Strong employment growth is set to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  Recent economic indicators have generally been positive and are consistent with a continuation of strong growth in the economy. My Department will publish updated economic forecasts as part of the 2018 Stability Programme Update in April. </p>  <p>  While the short-term outlook is positive, there are a number of risks at present both internationally and domestically.  Externally, the principal risk is the impact of Brexit.  However the policy stance in the US, in relation to both trade and taxation, is also a key source of uncertainty.  Domestically, competitiveness, housing supply pressures and the potential of overheating are among the significant risks we face.</p>  <p>  The best way to mitigate such risks is to improve the resilience of the economy.  The Government will play its part by continuing to implement competitiveness-oriented policies &ndash; including those that address bottlenecks &ndash; and ensuring that the public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.</p>  <p>  Such policies will have an important role to play if the strategic outcomes identified as part of the Project Ireland 2040 are to be achieved.</p></reply>

HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.  As such HBFI will not have targets in relation to social or affordable housing but will provide a significant contribution to supporting the delivery of additional supply of all types of residential housing in the coming years. </p>  <p>  While no specific criteria regarding the pricing of HBFI funded developments are envisaged increasing the level of housing output will increase the affordability of housing more generally, which in turn also will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing.  For example, any residential developments funded by HBFI will be subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by HBFI will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.</p>  <p>  Though HBFI is intended to be a debt funder for private residential projects, I can assure the Deputy that this Government is equally determined to tackle the issue of housing affordability.  In January the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government made a number of additional announcements in this regard including the launch of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and a new Affordable Purchase Scheme each of which should make a contribution to delivering homes that are more affordable for potential buyers.</p></reply>

The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union.  This is a European Commission initiative to mobilise capital in Europe.  A main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.  The Capital Markets Union specifically states how alternative sources of finance are more widely used in other parts of the world, and the widely held view is that should play a bigger role in providing financing to companies that struggle to get funding, especially SMEs and start-ups.</p>  <p>  In relation to the study mentioned, I am not in a position to comment on individual taxpayers.</p></reply>

In broad terms, one of the main objectives of both Reports is to try and address the issue of consistency of award levels, through adherence to the Book of Quantum, no matter where an award is made.  If such a consistency of awards is applied in a broad sense, particularly for soft tissue injuries, it will have two very significant effects: (i) there will be less reason for cases to go to litigation, as the level of awards granted by the courts will be aligned in general with those provided by PIAB; this in turn should mean a reduction in legal costs and (ii) a stable claims and awards environment will mean that the reserves put aside by insurers to meet future claims do not have to be regularly adjusted to reflect new developments, such as increases in award levels.  </p>  <p>  Finally,  while I have no doubt that higher premiums have been a contributory factor to  the recent return to profitability of some companies,  this has followed a number of years where in some instances significant losses have occurred.  What we need is a more stable market from both a pricing and profit perspective rather than the volatility we have had in recent years. In this regard, I believe that the implementation of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Reports will help ensure that the insurance sector is stable and consistent, making it more attractive to new entrants, resulting in more competition and more affordable prices.</p></reply>

It also included a programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes including a &ldquo;reckless trading&rdquo; provision under excise law for oil traders, that have been introduced over a number of Finance Acts, to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to introduce from the beginning of April 2015, in Ireland and the United Kingdom, a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels.</p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel in recent years.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted National Random Sampling Programmes in 2016, 2017 and 2018 with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programmes involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the marker introduced in 2015.  In all three years, no evidence of this marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This constitutes persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has resulted in the near elimination of selling of laundered product at retail level.  The available evidence to date indicates that Accutrace cannot be laundered by conventional methods.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that while the effectiveness of the measures introduced over the last few years is very welcome as is and the very positive outcome of the collaboration with HMRC, Revenue is not complacent and is mindful of the resourcefulness of those involved in criminality in the fuel trade.  Revenue remains vigilant and ready to respond to any new developments in this area. </p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, the use of analytics and detection technologies, optimising the deployment of resources and extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis.</p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade in tobacco at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Action has also been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.</p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Revenue, who in a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as part of the Joint Agency Task Force, last week closed down an illicit commercial cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, Co. Louth.  I understand from Revenue that this was the first time a commercial illicit cigarette production plant was discovered in the State and the factory was in full operation when Revenue officers and the Armed Support Unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na entered the premises.  Revenue officers found more than 60 tonnes of tobacco, all the pre-cursor components for the manufacture of cigarettes, and approximately 25 million cigarettes ready for distribution.  This was a sophisticated self-contained operation with machinery capable of producing 250,000 illicit cigarettes per hour and pre-processing, processing and packaging facilities, along with living quarters.</p>  <p>  In assessing the overall effectiveness in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS/MRBI for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive.  The survey in 2017 found that 13% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit.  This figure is slightly up from the levels of 12% and 10% reported in 2015 and 2016 respectively but is nevertheless lower than in earlier years.</p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority.  In addition, I can say to the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance their capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas.</p></reply>

Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in <b>November 2015</b>;</p><p>- 'An Exposure Analysis of Sectors of the Irish Economy&rsquo; &ndash; An in-depth analysis of the possible sectoral and regional impacts of Brexit arising from Ireland's trade relationship with the UK, published by Department of Finance in <b>October 2016</b>(Updated March 2017);</p><p>- 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' &ndash; Published under the Department of Finance-ESRI research programme in <b>November 2016</b>; and</p><p>- &lsquo;Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context&rsquo; &ndash; An analysis of trade exposure to the UK in comparison to other EU Member States, published by the Department of Finance in<b>September 2017.</b></p><p>The results in these studies show that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant.  Estimates from the macroeconomic modelling work with the ESRI project that, ten years after Brexit, in a WTO environment the level of Irish output could be as much as 3.8 per cent below a baseline of what it otherwise would have been.  Projections by Copenhagen Economics, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation, which my officials inputted into, suggest that the impacts could be higher if the EU and UK significantly diverge from one another in terms of regulatory standards.</p><p>Of course these projections are on a no policy change basis.  However, with the future trade path between the UK and EU still unknown, it is crucially important that we prepare our economy for the challenges ahead.</p><p>In this context, the Government has already taken a number of important steps including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, Ireland Connected, our Trade and Investment Strategy, and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.  The best way to deal with the uncertainties arising from Brexit is to continue the Government&rsquo;s competitiveness oriented policies and prudent management of the public finances.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, particularly in relation to younger drivers this has not always been positive.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would recommend drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2016, section 43 of the 1997 Act provides that the Central Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017.  This review resulted in the publication of Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) which consulted on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions.  One of the proposals in CP109 was that credit unions be permitted to provide funding for the provision of social housing to Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).</p>  <p>  Submissions to CP109 were broadly supportive of credit unions providing funding to Tier 3 AHBs.  Taking account of the feedback provided to CP109, amended regulations commenced on 1 March 2018 which permit credit unions to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of regulatory reserves for all other credit unions.  These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is open to considering further investment proposals.  Where the Central Bank receives detailed proposals which can demonstrate that an investment could fall within the appropriate risk profile for credit union investments, it will consider further amendments to the investment regulations to facilitate such investments in the future. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has committed to undertaking and publishing analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending investment regulations for credit unions, to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment regulations have had.</p></reply>

This approach is reflected in the draft Withdrawal Agreement and its Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that our preference is to avoid a hard border through the wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, or through specific solutions and we are also committed to exploring specific solutions to be proposed by the UK, if necessary.  At the same time, and should it prove necessary, there is now the necessary legal provision to implement the backstop of maintaining full alignment in Northern Ireland with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to protect North South cooperation and to avoid a hard border. </p>  <p>  On 19 March 2019 the UK agreed that a backstop solution for the border will form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. The UK has also agreed that all the issues identified in the EU text will be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution for the border.</p>  <p>  Prime Minister May confirmed these agreements in her letter to President Tusk, in addition to reiterating the UK's commitment to agreements reached last December on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including the overarching guarantee on avoiding a hard border. </p>  <p>  Like all Government agencies, the Revenue Commissioners are actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives. However, the precise customs arrangements that will apply after Brexit will depend on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and UK.</p></reply>

The reduction of NPL's is also being given high priority at EU level with the Commission announcing their "Action Plan to Tackle Non-Performing Loans in Europe" in July 2017. The action plan calls upon various institutions including the Commission to take appropriate measures to further address the challenges of high NPL ratios in Europe. </p>  <p>  In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPLs since the financial crisis.

As part of the CCMA&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) each bank has developed a suite of forbearance treatments and resolution strategies.  Such treatment strategies include arrears capitalisation, reduced payments, split mortgages and voluntary sale for loss which may involve an element of debt write off.</p>  <p>  There is no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to restructuring mortgages and clearly each borrower&rsquo;s solution is tailored to their own personal circumstances and is anchored in an assessment as to their level of affordability.  It is also not for me as Minister to determine how bank's should design and implement their impairment and write-off policies. But in each case the core objectives remains the same that is to ensure that arrears solutions are sustainable in the long term and that they comply with the spirit and the letter of all regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  However in recent times, loan sales as a last resort have also been a feature of the deleveraging process.

It utilises an on-lending model, making finance available through partner finance providers known as on-lenders.  </p>  <p>  The SBCI began lending in March 2015. To the end of December 2017, SBCI supported funding of &euro;925m has been provided to 22,928 SMEs supporting 119,533 jobs.

The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-resident investors to invest in Irish property.  IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors.</p>  <p>  A Real Estate Investment Trust or REIT is a quoted company, used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property.  A REIT is exempt from corporation tax on qualifying income and gains from rental property, subject to a high profit distribution requirement to. A REIT provides the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the taxation regimes remain appropriate for these entities.

For example, in the case of Project Glas, the recently announced project announced by PTSB to sell a portfolio of NPLs, officials were first briefed by the bank on the timing of the sale, and potential composition of the portfolio, in the week commencing 15<sup>th</sup>January. Officials in turn, briefed me on the matter on 19<sup>th</sup>January. </p><p>In addition to the regular engagement Department officials have with the banks, I myself have met recently with senior officials of some of the Irish retail domestic banks and intend holding similar meetings with the remaining banks in due course.  At these meetings, loan sales were discussed, where relevant.  The Deputy will be aware in this regard, that it is not appropriate for me to put any more facts into the public domain, over and above what the banks themselves have disclosed, as I must respect commercial confidentiality and stock exchange disclosure rules.</p><p>For clarity, I should highlight for the Deputy that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.  The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.  These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. Loan sales do not require my consent, though the banks are required to formally consult with me. In the case of the current PTSB loan sale process, the bank has not yet consulted with me but will do so in due course.</p><p>The Deputy has asked me to comment on my views on the decision by PTSB not to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 27th February.  In its response to the Committee, the bank highlighted that it would not be appropriate for its executives to attend a meeting on the original date proposed, as the bank was in a &quot;closed period&quot; ahead of the publication of its annual results on 14<sup>th</sup>March.  However, the bank did state it was agreeable to meeting with the Committee on an alternative date and this meeting subsequently took place on 22<sup>nd</sup>March.  Under the circumstances, my view is that the bank&rsquo;s approach to the Committee&rsquo;s request for a meeting was not unreasonable.</p></reply>

This is in line with the European Council Guidelines agreed on 23 March, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK in the future.  The Government and its EU partners agree that any future agreement must have the correct balance of rights and obligations, and that the integrity of the Single Market must be preserved.  This is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests as membership of the Single Market is a core element of our economic strategy.  Nevertheless, it is still our view that any EU-UK future relationship agreement should be comprehensive and ambitious and as wide as possible in its scope.</p>  <p>  The text of the Withdrawal Agreement will include the legal terms for the transitional arrangements, which are hugely important for Ireland in giving certainty to individuals and businesses.  We welcome that the EU has proposed that the whole of the EU acquis will apply during the transition, which means that the status quo will be preserved with the aim of avoiding any gaps or disruption between the UK leaving the EU and when a future relationship agreement enters into force, we further welcome the UK&rsquo;s agreement to an orderly transition and consider this as an important step for Irish business.</p>  <p>  EU excise rules apply to the trade in alcohol, tobacco and mineral oil products.  Such excisable goods move at present across the EU under a controlled messaging and confirmation system that is shared by all EU member states, known as the EU excise movement and control system.  This system is in place to monitor and record the movement of excisable goods while duty is suspended, and to ensure that the correct amount of excise duty is paid when excise goods are released anywhere in the EU for consumption.</p>  <p>  The future arrangements that will apply to cross border movements of excisable goods will depend on the outcome of discussion on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  In accordance with EU rules, it will technically be the case that if such an agreement does not provide for UK participation in the EU Excise Movement Control System, importers of excisable goods will still have the facility to import such goods from the UK with payment of excise duty suspended until the goods are released from the importer&rsquo;s excise warehouse.</p></reply>

Companies and Governments around the world are now fully analysing what are very complex changes.  Naturally, this is of great interest to Ireland given the large volume of US investment here. Consequently, my officials and our Embassy in the US, have been and continue to engage with business and others to fully understand the potential impacts of the changes in the US. We have also been engaging at EU level with other member states and the EU Commission on the implications for European trade with the US.</p>  <p>  However, much of the detail of the proposed changes remains to be clarified in US IRS and Treasury Regulations yet to be published, and questions remain particularly regarding the compatibilitity of some aspects of the reforms with WTO rules and other international obligations.</p>  <p>  I should mention that the US measures regarding deemed repatriation means that the United States is calling in its taxes.  Companies will be required to pay hundreds of billions of dollars in tax liabilities, dating back to 1986.  This is a vindication of what Ireland has been saying for many years.  Though others have called on Ireland to claim these taxes, we have always been clear on what was Irish and what was not.  Importantly, the deemed repatriation draws a line under the lingering controversy surrounding untaxed international profits.  </p>  <p>  While we remain alert and reponsive to any changes in the US and international tax environment, it is clear that Ireland&rsquo;s access to the European market is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI from the US and elsewhere.  Global business, from the US or elsewhere, will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain very competitive and attractive as an EU location to invest in and from which to do business.</p></reply>

The legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits.</p>  <p>  A review of the quantum of the reduction in pension benefits payable to persons in the private and commercial sector as a result of the stamp duty levy on pension schemes has not been undertaken by my Department.</p></reply>

Personal representatives are chargeable to capital gains tax in respect of gains made on the sale of assets during the course of the administration of a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.</p>  <p>  Persons who inherit assets are also chargeable to capital gains tax if they dispose of those assets where they have increased in value since the date of death.</p>  <p>  I would also wish it to bring to the attention of the Deputy that one of the main of the reasons presented worldwide for inheritance tax is that it acts to address, to some extent, the concentration of wealth within families and to spread some of the benefit of inter-generational wealth transfers to society generally.</p>  <p>  It follows that the basic principle on which CAT operates is that when a gift or inheritance takes place the wealth of the beneficiary grows, and this growth in wealth should be liable to taxation in the same way as income or gains through employment or investment.</p>  <p>  The situation in this country is that inheritance tax and capital gains tax are entirely separate taxes and operate independently.  Inheritance tax is charged on a person who inherits assets based on the value of those assets.  Capital gains tax is charged on the person disposing of assets whose value has increased since being acquired. However, where both of these taxes are chargeable on the same event, a credit is given against inheritance tax for capital gains tax paid.</p>  <p>  I understand that in Australia capital gains tax following a death operates in the same way as it does in this country. It is charged on the increase in value of inherited assets between the date of death and the date of their disposal.  This seems to be the standard capital gains tax treatment and is not imposed as an alternative to an inheritance. Australia, unlike this country, does not tax the value of inherited assets.</p>  <p>  Clearly individual States can make changes to their tax legislation as they consider appropriate, but I have no plans to abolish inheritance tax.</p></reply>

My Department along with the Department of Rural and Community Development are jointly tasked with the responsibility of fulfilling this commitment. Officials in both departments have been working closely together.</p>  <p>  Local public banking is a system of state ownership of particular banks or other financial institutions. The local public banks in Germany are called &ldquo;Sparkassen&rdquo;. The operation of these Sparkassen is confined to particular geographic regions local in which they operate. Their aim is to promote economic development and financial inclusion in this area, not just profit maximisation. Working closely with local regional SMEs and building close relationships is an important part of their business model as well.</p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking included a number of aspects. There was engagement with stakeholders and interested parties through a public consultation process conducted last year. Additionally, there has been substantial analysis carried out of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group. This proposal set out a potential model of local public banking, based on the German Sparkassen model, in Ireland. There have been a number of meetings between officials and representatives from Irish Rural Link and SBFIC.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D. and I anticipate that we will be in a position to jointly submit this report for Government approval in the near future. As well as this ongoing work, my Department is working with other Government departments to develop tailored and innovative policy initiatives and continue to support the needs of Irish SMEs and rural economic development, which I assure the Deputy remains a key Government priority.</p></reply>

Revenue is however very conscious that some of its customers are not being allowed LoCall rates by their telephone service providers when using the service and has been actively seeking ways to reduce the cost burden. </p><p>This includes evaluating new telephony technology which will provide a robust, reliable and scalable telephone service that does not rely on 1890 architecture.  Revenue is also exploring the use of other technologies that will enable customers through their existing &lsquo;inclusive packages&rsquo; (bundle) to &lsquo;phone&rsquo; Revenue from links within its website (www.revenue.ie) and mobile app (RevApp) without incurring the 1890 telephone costs.  Revenue hopes to be in a position to launch some of these enhancements in 2018.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) held a public consultation in 2017 on the five classes of &lsquo;Non-Geographic Number&rsquo; (NGN) services that are available. These include the &lsquo;1800&rsquo; service&rsquo;&rsquo; (Freephone), the &lsquo;1850&rsquo; service (Shared Cost- Fixed Charge per Call), the &lsquo;1890&rsquo; service (Shared Cost- Charge per Minute), the &lsquo;0818&rsquo; service (Universal Access) and the &lsquo;076&rsquo; service<b></b>(Nomadic).  As part of the consultation process, views were invited from interested parties and Revenue made a submission expressing its dissatisfaction at the rates charged for 1890 calls. Revenue also supported ComReg&rsquo;s proposal that the retail charge applicable to a caller using any of the NGN services should not exceed the retail charge that would apply had the caller used a Geographic Number. Revenue is currently awaiting the outcome of the consultation process.</p><p>On a wider note, I am aware that Revenue has significantly enhanced its range of online services to reduce the need for customer telephone contact.  This includes a new website (www.revenue.ie) which is specifically designed to help customers more easily find the information they are looking for. The information on the website is written in plain language and is easy to find. All of the feedback to date strongly confirms that the new service is very effective and has been well received by the vast majority of users.</p></reply>

Each Revenue compliance intervention is designed to be in the form which is most efficient in terms of both the time taken to carry it out and the resources needed to address the perceived tax risk.  Depending on the progress or lack of progress of an initial compliance intervention and the nature and scale of non-compliance identified, the intervention can be escalated to an audit or investigation if this is necessary. </p><p>The number of non-audit compliance interventions (known as &ldquo;aspect queries&rdquo; which involves Revenue examining in detail particular aspects of a taxpayer&rsquo;s  activities) which Revenue carried out on section 110 companies was 348 in 2016 and 203 in 2017 (a total of 551 for the two years).  As of 28 February 2018, 36 aspect queries in respect of section 110 companies have been finalised in 2018 to date.  Moreover, there are 192 aspect queries currently underway in respect of section 110 companies. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s money laundering compliance regime is governed by the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. </p><p>In common with any other business or person operating within the State, Section 110 companies which fall within the definitions of designated entities under the Act are subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulatory measures contained in the Act, and fall under the supervision of the relevant competent authority to ensure that they are in compliance with these obligations. </p><p>In addition to these direct measures, many companies will have solicitors, auditors, bankers, paying agents and registrars, which are subject to AML/CFT requirements in respect of their own customers.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s AML regime has recently been peer reviewed by the FATF and this evaluation found that  &ldquo;<i>Ireland has a sound and substantially effective regime to</i><i>tackle money laundering and terrorist financing</i>&rdquo;.  The competent authorities under the Act follow a risk-based approach in the supervision of their respective sectors and have established good cooperation with financial institutions and designated non financial businesses and professions. Coordination, cooperation and the use of financial intelligence are strong points of the Irish AML/CFT framework.</p></reply>

As a result impacted firms in both Ireland and the UK are extensively engaged in contingency planning which may result in the relocation of business from the UK to the EU (including Ireland) and vice-versa.  The Central Bank of Ireland and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) in the UK are in intensive dialogue with firms who are impacted and it is important to note that not all firms are impacted and/or impacted in the same way. The European regulatory system is formulating the supervisory guidance on the many issues raised by Brexit and the Central Bank of Ireland is heavily involved in the design of these policies through our participation in the SSM and the European Supervisory Authorities.  While many firms are moving forward with Brexit preparation plans, the final impact of Brexit on banks and insurers will depend on the outcome of the EU27-UK negotiations, with the nature and duration of transition arrangements an important factor in determining the speed of adjustment. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s preparation and contingency work is ongoing and continues to examine all possible scenarios and challenges, and is a key input into the whole of Government approach. As part of its contingency planning, the Department is engaged on an ongoing basis in examining the potential impacts of Brexit on the financial services sector and potential mitigants.  As part of this work the Department liaises with other Government Departments and Agencies who have responsibilities in this area, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The Department also engages closely, via the Financial Stability Group with the Central Bank of Ireland, which has the statutory responsibility for financial stability.  Brexit is a standing item on the Group&rsquo;s agenda. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government&rsquo;s strategy to mitigate the impact of Brexit includes fully exploiting opportunities arising.  With regard to the Financial Services sector, Brexit will provide opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services based inward investment. In that regard, Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D. has responsibility for Financial Services, including the implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department, along with the Department of Rural and Community Development are assigned the responsibility of fulfilling the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to "thoroughly investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions".

The Commission on Credit Unions report in 2012 recommended the introduction of a tiered regulatory approach to ensure that &lsquo;regulatory requirements in place for credit unions are proportionate to the nature and scale of the credit union.&rsquo; The Commission recommended a three tier system of regulation.</p>  <p>  The CUAC report in 2016 recognised the significant challenges in the introduction of a tiered system and that the approach adopted can be expected to have a profound long-term effect on the sector and on balance considered a two tier system of regulation more appropriate.</p>  <p>  Tiered regulation was also the subject of a Central Bank consultation, CP76, which finished in 2014. In light of the feedback received, the Central Bank did not propose to introduce a tiered regulatory framework for credit unions at that time.  </p>  <p>  The Implementation Group, established to monitor and oversee implementation of the CUAC Report recommendations, continues to consider tiered regulation. The Implementation Group is finalising a comprehensive paper which will put forward a number of proposals for consideration by the Central Bank. I expect that the Implementation Group will report to me shortly.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can advise the Deputy that my Department will shortly issue an information note to explain all of the levies and charges the credit union sector pays. The Stabilisation Levy review which my Department undertook in 2017 has also been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

For example, in the case of Project Glas, the recently announced project announced by PTSB to sell a portfolio of NPLs, officials were first briefed by the bank on the timing of the sale, and potential composition of the portfolio, in the week commencing 15th January. Officials in turn, briefed me on the matter on 19th January. </p>  <p>  As this information was commercially sensitive, and as I am obliged to comply with stock exchange disclosure and market abuse rules, I was not in a position to discuss it publicly at the time.</p>  <p>  In addition to the regular engagement Department officials have with the banks, I myself have met recently with senior officials of some of the Irish retail domestic banks and intend holding similar meetings with the remaining banks in due course. At these meetings, loan sales were discussed, where relevant. The Deputy will be aware in this regard, that it is not appropriate for me to put any more facts into the public domain, over and above what the banks themselves have disclosed, as I must respect commercial confidentiality and stock exchange disclosure rules.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that, in the case of PTSB, no loan has been sold yet and it won&rsquo;t be known how many loans will be sold for a number of months, nor the composition of these loans. In addition, it is not known to whom the loans will be sold. However, I want and expect PTSB to be transparent with their customers when it comes to this sale process as it evolves.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that there are no changes to the rights or obligations of a customer whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. In addition, as credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), all protections under the CCMA are unchanged. The customer is in the exact same position as they were before their loan was sold. In relation specifically to restructured loans, including splits, any purchaser will be obliged to honour the terms of the restructure agreement, should such loans be included in the final sale. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the protections currently in place, I have made it clear that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other parties in an effort to see if we can strengthen and enhance the protections, in a sensible manner, that are already in place for mortgage holders. I would highlight in this regard the Bill that has been introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath which seeks to regulate credit agreement owners of mortgage loans and which has received Government support.</p>  <p>  For clarity, I should highlight for the Deputy that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. Loan sales do not require my consent, though the banks are required to formally consult with me. In the case of the PTSB loan sale, the bank has not yet consulted with me but will do so in due course.</p></reply>

It will include an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration. The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons. It will also include a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p>  <p>  My Department is advancing work on this matter in conjunction with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government, Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Revenue Commissioners. The purpose of the review will be to inform me in relation to any actions I may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. This will enable me to revert to Government with proposals for change to the LPT in a timely way. Any such change would need to be legislated for by the first quarter of 2019 so that the Revenue Commissioners can be in a position to have the necessary administrative and technical arrangements in place in time in respect of the 2020 LPT year.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that these forecasts are contingent on a number of variables, including updated GNI forecasts, the size of the overall EU budget for the year and other EU budget operational developments which will only emerge as the year progresses. As a result, all forecasts will be monitored and updated on an ongoing basis as new information becomes available. </p>  <p>  The current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) (2014-2020) provides a medium-term framework for financial programming and budgetary discipline by ensuring that EU spending is predictable and stays within agreed limits.

The reduction of NPL's is also being given high priority at EU level with the Commission announcing their "Action Plan to Tackle Non-Performing Loans in Europe" in July 2017. The action plan calls upon various institutions including the Commission to take appropriate measures to further address the challenges of high NPL ratios in Europe.</p>  <p>  In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPLs since the financial crisis. Despite this progress, the level of NPLs in the sector remains well above the European average of c.5% (of gross loans). Hence in recent years the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.</p>  <p>  Progress to date in reducing NPL's has been primarily achieved by customers engaging directly with their banks and agreeing a sustainable restructure which provides the customer with an achievable path out of arrears. However in recent times, loan sales as a last resort have also been a feature of the deleveraging process. This would be in cases where meaningful engagement has not been forthcoming or affordability is not evident and in recognition of the fact that the end of the road has been reached and achieving an acceptable NPL ratio will not be possible without loan sales.</p>  <p>  Under the Relationship Frameworks (RFs) the disposal of loans is a commercial decision for the management and Board of each individual institution and is not subject to Ministerial consent. I therefore do not have the power to stop a loan sale. These agreements are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally and they were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. While loan sales do not require my consent, banks are required to formally consult with me during the process.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to highlight that the contractual terms of borrowers remain in place post any loan sale. In addition, all the protection enjoyed by borrowers under the CCMA is unaffected. In relation to buy to let or BTL mortgages, it should be noted that the rights of tenants remain unchanged if they happen to live in a property connected to a loan sale.</p></reply>

At the end of 2017, it completed its work on the development of this Scheme and on 19 December 2017, the Government approved the General Scheme of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill. </p>  <p>  The Bill is included in the Government Legislative Programme on the list of Priority Legislation for publication this session.  It was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny, and that Committee contacted me in February to indicate that it would not be conducting any further scrutiny on the Bill.  It should also be noted that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel assigned a drafter to the Bill on 26 January 2017 and officials in my Department are currently working with the drafter to finalise a draft of the Bill as soon as possible.  A consultation will also have to take place with the European Central Bank on the Bill once it is published.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it will take a certain amount of time following publication of the Bill, for it to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas however I am hopeful that with the cooperation of all parties in the Houses, the Bill can be considered and approved expeditiously. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the Database can be operationalised quickly following the enactment of the legislation, the Central Bank has continued to work in parallel on the technical specifications for the Database and recently held a series of meetings with the insurance sector as part of its consultations with the sector on developing these specifications.</p></reply>

I stressed the importance of translating into the legal text the commitments and principles agreed in the Joint Report in December, including the backstop.  President Tusk reiterated his strong solidarity with Ireland and said that our concerns were shared EU concerns.  We also discussed the EU guidelines on the future relationship between the EU and the UK (then in draft form), which took into account the parameters outlined by Prime Minister May in her Mansion House speech.</p>  <p>  I said that the draft guidelines reflected our ambition for a close partnership with the UK, while ensuring a level playing field and the integrity of the Single Market.  I welcomed, in particular, the commitment to revisit our position should the UK approach evolve.</p>  <p>  On digital taxation, I said that all companies, including digital platforms, should pay their fair share of tax.  We are committed to global tax reform but we need an approach which is evidence-based, sustainable in the long-term, and focussed on aligning taxing rights with the location of real substantive value-creating activity. </p>  <p>  That is why we have been working through the OECD to achieve the widest possible international consensus.  This is a complicated area and it is important that we get it right.  In our view, short term and uncoordinated measures could lead to unintended consequences. </p>  <p>  On the future of the Economic and Monetary Union, President Tusk noted the Joint Paper which had been published by the Nordic, Baltic, Dutch and Irish Finance Ministers earlier this month, and looked forward to further discussions at the Euro Summit on 23 March.</p>  <p>  We exchanged views on EU trade policy and agreed that Europe and the US should make every effort to work together.</p>  <p>  We also discussed EU relations with Turkey and agreed the importance of continued engagement, notwithstanding our concerns in relation to human rights.</p></reply>

My visit included engagements in Austin Texas, Durant Oklahoma, Washington D.C. and New York. </p>  <p>  In Austin, I paid a courtesy call on Governor Abbott. Our conversation focused on the bilateral economic relations between Ireland and Texas. We did not discuss the Mexican border. I spoke at the South by South West Festival, where I also visited the stands of a number of Irish-owned companies exhibiting at the Festival including; Tweak, Warduck, Food Marble, Mashable, Learnupon, Edgescan, Usheru, Digisoft, Video Elephant, and GirlCrew.</p>  <p>  In Durant, Oklahoma, where I visited the Choctaw Nation of Native Americans, I also had a courtesy call with Governor Mary Fallin during which we discussed deepening bilateral relations between Ireland and Oklahoma, especially economically. </p>  <p>  In Washington D.C. I held political meetings with President Trump, Vice President Pence, as well as with senior members of Congress including Speaker Ryan, House Majority Leader McConnell, Senators Schumer and Leahy, Congressmen Neal and King, and the Friends of Ireland Caucus. My priority in these discussions was to further develop the US - Ireland bilateral relationship, and to advance Ireland's interests, including in relation to trade, and the status of undocumented Irish citizens in the US. </p>  <p>  As has been reported, President Trump indicated that he was favourably disposed towards the possibility of a bilateral agreement on immigration issues, based on a reciprocal arrangement for US and Irish citizens that could help resolve the difficult situation faced by undocumented Irish citizens in the US. However, it is important to recall that finding a solution remains a complicated question that requires support both from the Executive and from Congress. We will continue to work at all levels to secure a positive outcome.</p>  <p>  In relation to our discussion on Brexit, this was an opportunity for me to brief the President on the state of play with negotiations, and Ireland's priorities and objectives. The President thanked me for the update and indicated his hope for a successful outcome to the negotiations process. I did not discuss Russia in detail with President Trump.</p>  <p>  Also in Washington D.C. I attended a roundtable discussion at the US Chamber, which included representatives of Johnson and Johnson Vision, Google, Allergan, Amazon, Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, FedEx, Intel, MetLife, S&amp;P Global and Zimmer Biomet. We discussed Ireland's economic progress, Brexit negotiations, International Trade &amp;amp; Taxation. </p>  <p>  I also attended a roundtable discussion with representatives of Irish-owned companies with operations in the US, including; Kerry, Intuition, Icon PLC, Kingspan, Globoforce, CRH/Oldcastle, Ocean Energy and Wisetek. We discussed the achievements of Irish owned companies in the US, their contribution to the two-way trading relationship between Ireland and the US, as well as the role of Enterprise Ireland and other State Agencies in supporting their continued expansion and growth in the US. </p>  <p>  I attended a series of events hosted by our enterprise agencies, including the Science Foundation Ireland St. Patrick's Day medal presentation, and a joint Irish agency lunch event with 350 business and economic contacts at which I launched the Global Ireland communications campaign.</p>  <p>I also spoke at a number of events, including at the Brookings Institution, at an event hosted by Ireland Funds, at a Reception hosted by Ireland's Ambassador to the US, and at an event marking the 20th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  In New York, I met Mayor Bill de Blasio on a number of occasions including at an event at the site of the new Irish Arts Center, and at the Mayor's Breakfast in Gracie Mansion which was a ceremonial occasion. My discussions with the Mayor were focused on the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and the Ireland-New York relationship. </p>  <p>  Also in New York, I attended a lunch with business leaders, hosted by Michael Bloomberg. Companies represented included JP Morgan Chase, Barclays, Bank of America and Citigroup amongst others. The event was a further opportunity to highlight Ireland's economic progress and our advantages as location for inward investment, including of course in the context of Brexit. </p></reply>

Mr Barnier updated me on the progress made with the UK in advancing discussions on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including an in-depth exchange on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p><p>Mr Barnier also provided an update to the EU27 Member States at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 20 March regarding the progress made with the UK in advancing discussions on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including in relation to transition.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D. </p><p>I welcome that the terms reflected in the draft Withdrawal Agreement are fully consistent with the EU&rsquo;s objective of agreeing a transition period based on the status quo.  This is an approach that I have strongly advocated for in my bilateral contacts with EU partners.  A transition period based on the status quo will provide certainty and limit disruption for our citizens and businesses. Under such an arrangement the UK will be expected to continue to apply the full EU acquis.</p><p>As concerns the duration of such a transition, the Government agrees that in the interests of long term certainty, and to accelerate agreement on the future relationship agreement, it must be time bound.  This is the overall view of both the EU and of the UK.  Therefore a date of 31 December 2020 has been set for the end of the transition period and this has been reflected in the text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.  This also takes account of the EU&rsquo;s budgetary processes and the fact that the current Multiannual Financial Framework will conclude at the end of 2020.  But equally, as the negotiations progress, the overriding objective on both sides must be to avoid any gaps and any cliff edge effects.  It is therefore welcome that the General Affairs Council has agreed to keep this under constant review, taking account of developments in the Brexit negotiations.<i></i>This provides the flexibility required.  </p></reply>

Recommendations for Ministerial travel over the Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day period are based on input from our Team Ireland network of diplomatic missions and state agency offices overseas and wide consultation and advice from across Departments and Agencies at home on where Ministerial visits would have most significant added value in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s interests internationally.</p>  <p>  One of the factors taken into consideration in making decisions on priority locations for Ministerial travel is whether there are any significant Ministerial visits planned in the period immediately before or after Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day which could lessen the impact of an a Ministerial visit during the Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day period itself.  In the case of India significant Education promotion trade missions were planned and took place in the run up to Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 2017 and again this year.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the Minister of State for Training, Skills and Innovation, John Halligan T.D. led 16 companies on a major education promotion mission to India from 18-26 February. On 22-27 February 2018, the Minister for State for Education, Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor led the largest education mission to India to date involving 20 Irish Higher Education institutions.  Given the scheduling of these two major Ministerial trade missions in the immediate run up to the Saint Patrick's Day period it was felt that our trade priorities in the region were already being addressed.  Given the resources associated with a St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit, it was felt that these would be best focussed elsewhere.</p></reply>

These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages.</p>  <p>  The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage.  The majority of online applications are currently being processed within 5 working days, well ahead of this target.  The award winning online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to other categories of renewals by the end of 2018.  I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports, whether residing in Ireland or overseas, to avail of the online passport application service where possible.</p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently 14 working days, one day ahead of the target turnaround time of 15 working days.  Other types of application submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports take longer due to additional security checks.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks we had higher than average turnaround times for some categories of application owing to high application volumes and disruption caused by adverse weather conditions and the subsequent closure of the Dublin and Cork passport offices for 2 days.  However as outlined the turnaround times have considerably reduce and in many cases are now shorter than the published target times.  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed.  Measures taken by the Passport Service include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime. </p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year.  This compares to 310 FTE staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year.  This year, since these figures were released, over 20 additional permanent staff have started with the Passport Service. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, in order to respond to seasonal demands and application increases, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (&ldquo;TCOs&rdquo;) to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork this year.  The vast majority of these TCOs are already in place with the remaining TCOs expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at the latest.  Targeted overtime for the Passport Service was also sanctioned to increase processing capacity. </p>  <p>  In managing increasing application volumes, my Department&rsquo;s approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff but to continue to implement service improvements in order to provide an exceptional service and minimise the impact high application volumes have on turnaround times.  The Passport Reform Programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.

The conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost over 400,000 lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  The recent increase in violence in Syria, in particular the vicious siege of Eastern Ghouta, underscores the extent to which an end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  I was present at the UN Security Council briefing on Eastern Ghouta in New York last month at which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations.  Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access on 24 February.  Ireland regrets that this has not yet been implemented and calls on the international community to redouble efforts to ensure the immediate and full implementation.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 26 February and 19 March. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  The EU hosted a donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling &euro;5.6 billion were made, and will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2018.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone.  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis.  Ireland also supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.</p></reply>

Clearly, a comprehensive, inclusive political solution to the conflict is urgently needed, both to end the suffering of the Syrian people and to prevent any further turmoil in the Middle East.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.

Ireland regrets that this has not yet been implemented and calls on the international community to redouble efforts to ensure the immediate and full implementation.</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned by the impact of the recent fighting in the Afrin region, including the displacement of over 100,000 civilians.  Officials from my Department met with the Turkish Ambassador to Ireland in early February shortly after the commencement of the Turkish operation.  They conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s overarching concern for the protection of civilians, including in the context of this particular operation, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. </p>  <p>  Ireland understands Turkey&rsquo;s concern about the conflict raging on its southern border.  Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the conflict, including in terms of migration and spill-over of violence.  However, our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities. </p>  <p>  I call on all parties to exercise restraint in order to avoid any further exacerbation of this already fragile situation and to cooperate in the effort to find a political solution under UN auspices which alone can bring lasting peace to Syria.</p></reply>

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a UN specialised agency which defines in detail the required format for a passport.  For example in a type 3 document (a standard passport book) the machine-readable zone must span two lines, and each line must be 44 characters long.  The following information must be provided in the zone: name, passport number, nationality, date of birth, sex, and passport expiration date.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service launched the Passport Card in October 2015.  This credit card sized document complies with ICAO specifications and can be used by adult Irish passport holders for travel to 31 countries in total including the EU/EEA and Switzerland and incorporates the very highest levels of cutting-edge security measures.  Since its launch, the Passport Service has issued over 90,000 passport cards to Irish citizens residing in the state and across the world.  I would encourage all adult citizens who hold a valid passport to consider applying for a passport card.</p></reply>

Issuing a passport in a different name is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage, adoption or gender reassignment, where civil or legal documents are available to verify the change.  In all other cases where an individual wishes to apply for a passport in a different name, the Act specifically requires evidence of usage of the new name over a two-year period.</p>  <p>  I am informed by officials in the Passport Service that the person in question wishes to have a passport issued in a name other than that on their birth certificate but that they has not supplied acceptable supporting documentation.  The Passport Service has advised the applicant of the requirements.  Until such a time as the applicant can provide the relevant documents, the Passport Service, in line with the Act, will be unable to issue a passport in the alternative name.</p>  <p>  Given that a name change effectively replaces an existing identity with a new one, the Passport Service must ensure that stringent checks are in place to mitigate any associated risks. The Passport Service&rsquo;s practice is in line with the relevant legislation and is intended to safeguard the high international reputation of the Irish passport and, in turn, protect the wellbeing and security of our citizens travelling abroad.</p></reply>

My aim in announcing the review was to strengthen this most important of relationships for Ireland both at the bilateral level and in the context of our common EU membership.  The review &ndash; which began before Christmas - covers the full spectrum of our relations with Germany, including its political, economic, social and cultural aspects.  This review is timely, given the enormous challenges that Ireland is facing in a rapidly changing EU and global environment.</p>  <p>  Germany is the world&rsquo;s fourth largest economy and a major player internationally as well as in the EU.  It is the second-largest inward investor in Ireland; our fourth-largest merchandise trading partner and one with which we enjoy a trade surplus.  Germany is also our third-largest source of tourism with some 650,000 visiting Ireland in 2016.</p>  <p>  I am convinced that there is still scope to build further on these numbers.</p>  <p>  All relevant government departments whose work touches on the terms of the review have been consulted, and their views are being fed into a draft report which is at an advanced stage of preparation.

As I have previously outlined, despite repeatedly stating its commitment to improving its human rights record, the Bahraini Government appears to be targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive attitude to those opposing or challenging the Government in any way.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution ring hollow when there are so many examples of violations of the most fundamental freedoms, including those of opinion and expression.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues and restrictions of civil liberties in Bahrain is regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain.  Most recently, last month, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain and Embassy officials in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.   At the 32nd session of the Human Rights Council in June 2016, Ireland, on behalf of a cross-regional group of States, delivered a statement proposing possible objective criteria which could guide the Council when deciding how to act on emerging situations of concern.  These criteria included, among others, whether there has been a call for action by the UN Secretary General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights or a relevant UN organ, body or agency. </p>  <p>  These criteria, often referred to as the &lsquo;Irish objective criteria&rsquo; may offer a useful guide, to help decide, in an objective and non-selective manner, when it is appropriate and necessary for the Council to engage with a concerned State.  These same independent factors are also a valuable guide for States in assessing whether to bring a specific country to the attention of the Council by issuing for, example a statement on the matter at the Human Rights Council.   </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017, and more recently at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  At the Human Rights Council session earlier this month, Ireland supported an EU statement under Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) which reiterated calls on Bahrain &ldquo;to maintain its commitments as to the respect of freedom of speech and human rights defenders.&rdquo;  Ireland also made reference to Bahrain in our national Item 4 statement.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

Concerns around these issues have led to significant tensions and even violence in recent years, which we have discussed in the Oireachtas.  The issues involved can be very complex and multifaceted.  There are many Christian denominations present, and their churches and traditional status and rights predate not only the foundation of Israel but even the former British Mandate, and go back to the Ottoman period or even earlier. Some European partners have historical and treaty links to various Christian denominations, and the Jordanian Government retains a role as guardians of the Muslim holy places.  Jerusalem is uniquely sensitive, and Israel&rsquo;s discriminatory treatment of Palestinians and their land rights under the occupation has meant that any proposed changes to the regime pertaining to religious properties are viewed with deep suspicion.I do not wish to comment on the specific issues which led to the brief closure as a protest of some of the Christian churches in Jerusalem last month. While the immediate threat was lifted, and the churches reopened, these matters are not resolved and could recur.</p><p>However, both Ireland and the European Union have consistently and on a number of occasions in recent years stressed the important principle that there should be no change in the <i>status quo</i>with regard to religious affairs, properties and rights in Jerusalem and the Occupied Territory, pending the final resolution of the position of the city and the holy places in a peace agreement. I have made this point myself directly to the Israeli authorities, and I repeat that principle again now.  My Department has also met with religious representatives from the city and the region. We will continue to do so, and to address the Israeli authorities on these issues.</p></reply>

The report acknowledges that such measures are likely have adverse impacts on investment and growth and risk increasing double taxation and complexity for taxpayers and tax authorities alike.  For those countries who wish to persist towards implementing interim measures in advance of an agreed global approach, the Report has identified some hazards to be avoided so that the damaging effects are mitigated in so far as it is possible to do so.  </p>  <p>  I share the view expressed in the Report that further analysis is needed to achieve a globally agreed, evidence based solution, sustainable in the long run and focussed on aligning taxing rights with the location of real substantive value creating activity.  It has long been our position that it has been the mis-match arising from different tax systems which has facilitated aggressive tax planning and the only sustainable way to address this is for countries to cooperate globally through the OECD.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to actively engage with work in the area of the digital economy at both OECD and EU level.  As you are ware, the European Commission have also last week published proposals for two Directives in this area.  We have been a strong voice in the many tax directives that have been agreed at EU level in recent years and we look forward to critically assessing and discussing the Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals with all Member States. </p></reply>

During the height of the financial crisis a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers.  </p>  <p>  This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.  As the MART process was rolled out a split mortgage solution or a part capital and interest solution that met certain criteria were accepted by the CBI as being sustainable for the purposes of these targets. </p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014, the focus has shifted from reducing mortgage arrears levels to reducing Non-performing Loans (NPLs).  This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016.  In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely. </p>  <p>  While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  </p>  <p>  Aside from direct interaction with the SSM, Department officials have also been actively involved in the discussions on NPLs through its involvement in the European Council&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee subgroup on NPLs, and the more recent European Commission Expert Group on NPLs.  While this has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s views are voiced and considered on the matter, ultimately the final arbiter on the resolution of NPLs for the Irish banks is the SSM. </p></reply>

The event, which was hosted by my colleague Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, is now in its third year and is a key deliverable as part of the Government&rsquo;s International Financial Services 2020 Strategy. </p>  <p>  Following a review of the 2017 forum IDA Ireland were tasked with planning and executing the European Financial Forum 2018.  As the department responsible for the delivery of  the IFS2020 Strategy officials from my department engaged regularly with IDA Ireland as to progress on the planning of the event and assisted with invitations to overseas speakers and delegates where required.</p>  <p>  The EFF 2018 was a tremendous success with almost 600 delegates in attendance from 24 countries representing over 350 different organisations.  Preliminary planning for the 2019 forum is currently underway, led once again by IDA Ireland.  We hope that the 2019 EFF will build on the continued success of the EFF as a showcase for Ireland&rsquo;s financial services environment and Ireland as a location for high quality investment.</p>  <p>  The evening before the EFF my colleague Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy launched the IFS2020 Action Plan 2018.  The Action Plan outlines 43 measures designed to improve Ireland&rsquo;s financial services environment, all to be actioned in 2018. </p>  <p>  In addition to Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy hosting the EFF, I had the opportunity to engage with the Vice President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovksis in a joint closing keynote address and conversation. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Forum is to support IFS2020 and the Strategy&rsquo;s aim to create 10,000 net new jobs in the international financial services sector, which translates to a 30% increase in those employed in the sector.  At this year&rsquo;s EFF it was confirmed that to date almost 7,000 net new jobs have been created in the sector since the Strategy began, representing 70% of the target, with two years remaining.</p></reply>

According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, in 2017 the EU and euro area economies grew by 2.4 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.  This would suggest that Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the EU in 2017.  While the 2017 outturn is based on preliminary quarterly data which is highly volatile and prone to revision, the numbers provide clear evidence of continued momentum in the economy.  Other indicators such as consumer spending, labour market trends and taxation receipts confirm Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic position. </p>  <p>  According to the European Commission, Ireland is also expected to be among the fastest growing economies in Europe this year and next.  The European Commission expects Ireland's economy to grow by 4.4 per cent in 2018 and 3.1 per cent in 2019.  This compares with growth of 2.3 per cent this year and of 2.0 per cent next year for the EU and the euro area respectively.  The Commission notes that consumer spending and construction investment are forecast to drive GDP growth in the short-term.  Strong employment growth, particularly for full-time jobs, should underpin a rise in disposable income and household consumption over the next two years. </p>  <p>  My Department will publish updated forecasts with the Stability Programme Update 2018 in April.  Given the strength of activity last year, growth forecasts for this year are likely to be revised upwards.</p>  <p>  However, economic challenges remain, mainly linked to the outcome of the negotiations between the EU and the UK and the potential changes to the international taxation and trading environments.  The best way to deal with the challenges we face, and to support continued economic growth, is through continued implementation of productivity-oriented policies along with sustainable public finances.  That is what this Government will continue to do.</p></reply>

Recently the term has also been used to refer to groups of investors that have broadened their scope to become active in other parts of the Irish financial services market.   </p>  <p>  However for the purposes of the reply from a taxation perspective, I assume the Deputies are referring to the use of the section 110 regime which is often linked to the debate on the activities of such funds.</p>  <p>  Section 110 is intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  It has been part of our corporation tax code since 1991, with significant amendments in 2003.  Securitisation involves the creation of tradeable securities out of an income stream or projected future income stream generated by financial assets.  The transaction can involve the use of a special purpose securitisation vehicle to facilitate the transaction and issue the securities.</p>  <p>  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk, and by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing. </p>  <p>  A section 110 company will be taxed on all of its income but will obtain a deduction for its expenses paid out to investors.  Effectively, the investors will be taxed in accordance with</p>  <p>  the rules in their own jurisdiction.   </p>  <p>  The section 110 regime was designed to improve Ireland&rsquo;s offering as a location for the conduct of financial services.  It has achieved that broad goal and the financial services industry now makes use of these vehicles as a support to financial intermediation.  Such financing is useful for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of finance to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations.  The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union.  This is a European Commission initiative to mobilise capital in Europe.  A main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.  The Capital Markets Union specifically states how alternative sources of finance are more widely used in other parts of the world, and the widely held view is that should play a bigger role in providing financing to companies that struggle to get funding, especially SMEs and start-ups.</p>  <p>  Section 22 Finance Act 2016 restricts the use of the section 110 regime to minimise Irish tax liabilities on Irish property or distressed debt transactions.  The core effect of the amendment removes the possibility for section 110 companies to use what are known as 'profit participating notes,' or PPNs, to sweep Irish property or distressed debt profits out of the company in a way that ensures little or no Irish tax liability arises.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2016, section 43 of the 1997 Act provides that the Central Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017.  This review resulted in the publication of Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) which consulted on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions.  One of the proposals in CP109 was that credit unions be permitted to provide funding for the provision of social housing to Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).</p>  <p>  Submissions to CP109 were broadly supportive of credit unions providing funding to Tier 3 AHBs with a significant number of those in favour citing the alignment of the social goals of both the credit union movement and the AHB sector as the principal rationale for permitting this type of investment. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the feedback provided to CP109, amended regulations commenced on 1 March 2018 which permit credit unions to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of regulatory reserves for all other credit unions.  These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank is open to considering further investment proposals.  Where the Central Bank receives detailed proposals which can demonstrate that an investment could fall within the appropriate risk profile for credit union investments, it will consider further amendments to the investment regulations to facilitate such investments in the future. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has committed to undertaking and publishing analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending investment regulations for credit unions, to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment regulations have had.</p></reply>

The amendment reduces this to 0%.  The effect of the changes are to prevent investors from getting tax relief for investing in their own companies.  This restriction does not apply if an individual and their relatives make their investments in the company while it is still at very initial stages before it commences any of its activities.  I should also emphasise that the restriction does not apply where an individual is only connected with a company through a prior investment to which EII relief applied.</p>  <p>  My Department has been in contact with the European Commission to advise it of the potential failure to comply with the General Block Exemption Regulations and the steps taken to correct this.  The Commission is continuing to examine the issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, as indicated in my press statement of 3 November 2017, the EII scheme will be reviewed in the current year to ensure that it operates as a competitive, efficient and effective measure in accordance with State Aid rules and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  Arrangements in this regard are underway.</p></reply>

The subject of the proposal is the physical printing of the banknotes.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is fully cognisant of its obligations to supply currency in all circumstances to the people of Ireland.  The proposal is consistent with those obligations.</p>  <p>  If the Commission take the decision to cease printing, a total of 45 staff (of the 170 staff in the Central Bank&rsquo;s currency centre) will be impacted.  The staff and their representatives are fully aware of the proposal.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank does not intend to seek compulsory redundancies and is committed to redeployment and retraining opportunities for impacted staff.  A voluntary severance package will also be made available to those staff. </p>  <p>  If a decision is taken to cease printing, the Central Bank is committed to engagement with staff representative bodies through the normal industrial relations channels on the implications for impacted staff.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan.  The Working Group continued its work throughout 2017 and subsequently published the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018. </p>  <p>  Stakeholder consultation formed the foundation upon which the Working Group&rsquo;s two Reports and their recommendations were developed.  This consultation process undertaken by the Working Group involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including Insurance Ireland and the major individual motor insurance providers.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all over the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been  discussed during these engagements.</p></reply>

This would be likely to result in higher premiums.  In addition, the Cost of Insurance Working Group believes that such an onerous requirement could result in the unintended consequence of discouraging new entrants to the market.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that I am seeking to have the previous year&rsquo;s premium included in renewal documentation.  In this regard my Department has engaged with Insurance Ireland on this matter and has made a submission as part of the aforementioned Central Bank consultation process. It will continue to engage on this issue to further improve the level of information provided to policyholders.</p></reply>

In 2012 and 2013, the effective rate was 10.1%.  I would note that while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted measures, such as the R&amp;D tax credit, available in Ireland which may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid.</p>  <p>  The issue of tax avoidance has been at forefront of the international tax agenda in recent years.  The agreement of the OECD BEPS reports in late 2015 represented a landmark achievement in agreeing comprehensive reform of the international tax system.  Ireland has taken a number of steps towards implementing the BEPS recommendations and the Coffey Review sets out a roadmap for Ireland to follow in bringing certainty to the implementation of the remaining recommendations, beginning with the launch of a consultation process which is now underway. </p>  <p>  In keeping with our commitment to transparency, Ireland was among the first countries to implement Country by Country Reporting.  These reports will be exchanged with all relevant countries to ensure tax authorities have a clear picture of the activities of large multinationals and can assess any risk that the correct tax has not been paid in the correct place.</p>  <p>  Ireland was also among the first countries to sign the OECD BEPS multilateral instrument (MLI) in June last year.  This MLI will provide the mechanism for extensive changes to tax treaties globally.  It will ensure that tax treaties are updated to reflect a number of important OECD BEPS recommendations, including agreed standards on treaty shopping and dispute resolution.  The first steps towards ratification were made in Finance Bill 2017.</p></reply>

However, if the taxpayers wish to contact their local Revenue office then officials would be happy to assist them.</p><p>In general the income tax treatment of persons aged 65 and over is as follows:</p><p>- An additional age tax credit is available.  For single individuals the credit is &euro;245 per year and for a couple who are married or in a civil partnership the credit is &euro;490.</p><p>- In addition to the age tax credit, individuals over the age of 65 are exempt from any tax where their income is below a threshold of &euro;18,000 for a single individual or &euro;36,000 for a jointly assessed couple.  If the couple have children that are under 18, over 18 and in full-time education or incapacitated,  the exemption limits are increased by &euro;575 per child for the first two children and &euro;830 per child for any additional children.  However, this exemption threshold is reduced by the amount of any income that is not subject to PAYE.  This reduction includes any pension payments made by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This is to ensure that the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax based on their total income consisting of both PAYE and non-PAYE income.</p><p>- Where a taxpayer&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant threshold, tax is calculated in the normal manner on the full amount of income.  However, if the taxpayer&rsquo;s income is above the thresholds by a small amount, a further relief, known as &ldquo;marginal relief&rdquo; is available. Marginal relief operates by reducing the individual or couple&rsquo;s tax liability for a year of assessment to 40% of the amount by which their income exceeds the threshold.  Where the application of marginal relief gives a more favourable tax outcome than the standard tax calculation, Revenue will apply this option.</p><p>Further information on the age tax credit and related exemptions can be found on the Revenue website at:</p><p><i> .</i></p></reply>

During the height of the financial crisis a key focus of the authorities was on stabilising and ultimately reducing mortgage arrears through the implementation of sustainable mortgage solutions that were agreed with borrowers.  </p>  <p>  This led to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) introducing public mortgage arrears resolution targets (MART) for the banks in H1 2013.  As the MART process was rolled out a split mortgage solution or a part capital and interest solution that met certain criteria were both accepted by the CBI as being sustainable for the purposes of these targets. </p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014, the focus has shifted from reducing mortgage arrears levels to reducing Non-performing Loans (NPLs).  This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016. In the course of their discussions they outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely. </p>  <p>  While my Department has been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  </p>  <p>  Aside from direct interaction with the SSM, Department officials have also been actively involved in the discussions on NPLs through its involvement in the European Council&rsquo;s Financial Services Committee subgroup on NPLs, and the more recent European Commission Expert Group on NPLs.  While this has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s views are voiced and considered on the matter, ultimately the final arbiter on the resolution of NPLs for the Irish banks is the SSM.</p></reply>

I also attend meetings of the Eurogroup, where the ministers of the euro area member states discuss matters concerning their shared responsibilities related to the euro.  The Eurogroup&rsquo;s main task is to ensure close coordination of economic policies among the euro area member states and to promote conditions for stronger economic growth. </p>  <p>  At both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, Ministers of the Member States work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation in the EU and euro area, including on the risks to the European economy&rsquo;s growth prospects. </p>  <p>  The European Semester was initiated in response to the crisis in 2010. It provides a framework for coordination of economic policies across the European Union in which guidance is provided to Member States before they take policy decisions at national level. The guidance is provided in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). As part of the Semester process, the Commission makes country-specific recommendations to provide tailored policy guidance to each EU country on how to boost jobs and growth, while maintaining sound public finances.  Following the economic crisis, budgetary surveillance was enhanced with the 'Six-Pack' and 'Two-Pack' regulations which seek to complement the European Semester through enhanced monitoring and surveillance of the fiscal policies of EU Member States.  </p>  <p>  The European economy is performing well with growth exceeding expectations in 2017.  The latest estimates from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, show that in 2017 the EU and euro area economies grew by 2.4 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.  The upturn is increasingly broad-based across EU countries.  The recovery has been supported by a number of factors including sound macroeconomic policies, strong business and consumer confidence and a gradual improvement in world trade.</p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Autumn Economic Forecast 2017 highlights risks to the European economy as being broadly balanced.  Downside risks relate to the process of the UK leaving the EU, global geopolitical instability and potentially tighter global financial conditions.  While bank fragilities in the euro area have eased, low profitability and legacy issues (i.e. non-performing loans) remain a concern.  Other economic challenges relate to potential changes to the international taxation and trading environments.  On the upside, uncertainties have diminished, economic sentiment has improved and with the rebound outside Europe potentially leading to a stronger, more durable expansion in Europe.</p>  <p>  Given the still high levels of unemployment and public and private debt across the EU, there are clearly no grounds for complacency.

In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future funding needs of SMEs. </p><p>In terms of monitoring the working capital and other requirements for SMEs, my Department biannually surveys the demand for credit by SMEs.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey just published, covering the period April to September 2017, which can be found at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The results of this survey show that, when pending applications are excluded, 88% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Working capital/cash flow requirements are provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 38% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  When asked about sources of finance for working capital, internal funds/retained earnings were the main finance source of working capital with 81% of working capital coming from this source (up 8%) since Sept. &lsquo;16. </p><p>Also, the latest publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Trends in Business Credits and Deposits which can be accessed at</p><p><i></i>recorded an increase in new lending to the construction sector.</p><p>Further, AIB has stated that construction, &quot;is of strategic importance for the economy and the bank. AIB is strongly supportive of the industry and we are ready and willing to increase our support as the industry grows.  We are the main bank to many of the largest developers but also we have a strong focus on mid-sized developers.  We created a new dedicated team in 2017 to serve mid-sized development groups following feedback from the industry that they struggled to get the attention of mainstream banks.  Overall we have more than doubled the Bank&rsquo;s Development Lending Team over the last twelve months&quot;.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and larger businesses which it sees as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish business have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

Growth is broad based with net exports also contributing positively to growth last year.</p><p>The strength of domestic demand is being felt in the labour market. Employment growth remains strong with an annual rate of 2.9 per cent recorded in 2017, representing the creation of over 61,000 additional jobs.</p><p>Data published in the first quarter of this year indicate that:</p><p>- Expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors continued in February with the Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index for the sectors recording their fifty seventh and sixty seventh successive month of expansion, respectively.</p><p>- The Consumer Sentiment Index was 105.2 in February, well above its long run average.</p><p>- The seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate for February was 6.1 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in February 2017.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost two thirds since its peak of 16 per cent in early-2012.</p><p>As part of Budget 2018, my Department forecast real GDP growth of 3.5 per cent this year.  The labour market should benefit from this, with employment growth of 2.3 per cent (48,000 jobs) expected this year.  Strong employment growth is set to further reduce the unemployment rate, to around 5 &frac12; per cent by the end of this year. </p><p>However, there are a number of risks at present including the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU.  In addition, the sharp appreciation of the euro-sterling rate over the last two years is posing significant challenges, particularly for the traditional sector, the tourism sector and areas sensitive to cross-border trade.</p><p>My Department has incorporated the estimated impact of a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; Brexit into the macroeconomic forecasts published as part of Budget 2018.  This shock is projected to reduce GDP growth by approximately &frac34; of a percentage point on average per annum over the 2019-2021 period.  These forecasts were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC).  The Department will publish updated forecasts as part of the April 2018 Stability Programme Update.</p><p>These projections were informed by Department of Finance &ndash; ESRI joint research which modelled the medium to long term impact of Brexit on Ireland. In particular, the forecasts were guided by the &ldquo;WTO scenario&rdquo;, whereby the UK and EU do not conclude a bilateral trade agreement and instead the UK exercises its rights under the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause of the WTO. </p><p>The best way to mitigate risks such as Brexit is to improve the resilience of the economy.  The Government will play its part by continuing to implement competitiveness oriented policies &ndash; including those that address emerging bottlenecks &ndash; and ensuring that the public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.</p></reply>

All of these Brexit-related studies are available on my Department's website. In addition, regular updates of my Department&rsquo;s Macro-Economic forecasts take account of the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  While the results in the 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' study published by my Department and the ESRI, show that the potential impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant under all scenarios, with output below what it otherwise would have been in a no Brexit scenario, it is important to note that the economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than it otherwise would have.  It should also be noted that these results are based on a &ldquo;no policy change basis&rdquo;.  However, with the future trade path between the UK and EU still unknown, it is crucially important that we prepare our economy for the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  Indeed, as we cannot control the international environment, the best way and most immediate policy under the Government's control to counter the likely negative economic impacts of Brexit is to prudently manage the public finances in order to ensure that Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  In this context, the Government has taken a number of important steps to maximise opportunities for the economy and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the Action Plan for Jobs, the Ireland Connected trade and investment strategy, and the preparation of a new 10-year Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  As discussions on the future relationship between the UK and the EU progress, my Department will continue to monitor the economic impacts of Brexit, including carrying out relevant analysis to make provision for issues arising from Brexit, and contingency plan for the future challenges ahead.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.404.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700065#WRH01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 213, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has developed the proposed flood relief scheme for Cork City and upstream to Inniscarra Dam following 11 years of detailed scientific and engineering study and design which has been carried out with the benefit of ongoing and regular public consultation with the general public and other key stakeholders.  The need for the project is beyond question as the City in particular suffers from regular flooding from both fluvial and tidal flood events with particularly severe events affecting the City in 2009, 2014 and the winter of 2015/16.  The scheme has been brought through the formal Public Exhibition or statutory consultation process as required under the Arterial Drainage Acts and detailed reports were put into the public domain at the completion of that phase of the project in December 2017.  These reports (see <i>www.lowerleefrs.ie</i>) deal comprehensively with the issues raised during the above consultative process and set out categorically how the proposed scheme is the only viable solution to the flooding problem in the city.</p><p>Among the detailed reports completed during the Exhibition stage is one dealing with the option of constructing a tidal barrier.  The proposal of a tidal barrier put forward by others was considered in depth and is found to be unworkable for cost, navigational and environmental reasons as well as lacking upstream storage capacity in the likely future climate change scenario.  It is, however, technically possible to construct a barrier elsewhere, at either side of Great Island, but the estimated whole life cost of this of up to &euro;1.7 billion also makes it a non-viable option.  In light of the in-depth analysis on the tidal barrier option for Cork carried out by international experts, the position is that a tidal barrier is not a viable solution for Cork and cannot be considered further.</p><p>Like other similar projects, the scheme for Cork City as exhibited includes a drainage system to cater for both surface water drainage and groundwater behind the flood defences.  The pumping element will only be required to operate during periods of extremely high river levels, for short durations around high tide.  For the majority of the time, the gravity drainage system will operate as at present and the normal groundwater regime will not be altered.  Detailed design is currently ongoing to finalise the finer detail of the drainage system, but what is proposed does not differ in principle from the scheme exhibited.  The published Exhibition Reports deal with the groundwater aspects of the scheme.</p><p>During the development of the scheme, the OPW and its partners, Cork City and County Councils, were acutely conscious of the need to avoid disruption to the city during construction works.  So while there will be some disruption during construction, it will be minimised by careful phasing of the works, traffic management including noise and dust management.  Works will also be co-ordinated in conjunction with Cork City Council to mitigate the overall duration of any disruption.  It is OPW&rsquo;s view that the permanent economic benefits of the scheme in protecting businesses and attracting new business to the city will significantly exceed any short-term economic impacts arising during the construction phase.</p></reply>

Significant reforms have been made in recent years and have made the work of the public service more transparent, decision-making more accountable and service delivery more effective and efficient.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020, which I launched last December, is a new policy framework designed to build on these previous reforms while expanding the scope of reform to focus more on collaboration, innovation and evaluation.  I am confident that Our Public Service 2020 will contribute to the strengthening and further development of our economy over the period of its implementation.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 is a whole-of-public-service initiative.  A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive the reform agenda and lead on its implementation.  This approach will support and enable public servants and their organisations to perform at their best and to work together to deliver high-quality, value-for-money outcomes that will benefit the economy.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable.  There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews.  The actions in Our Public Service 2020  will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020  contains an added focus on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture.  The newly established Reform Evaluation Unit will work closely with units within my Department focused on performance budgeting and spending reviews to strengthen the links between expenditure and reform.  This will take place alongside the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) which leads a programme of evaluation of public service delivery across the public service.  A series of rolling, selective reviews, which will cover the totality of Government spending over a three-year period to 2019, started in 2017.</p></reply>

This assessment, which was published in July 2017, focused on whether the plan met its objectives; provided clear recommendations for the future direction of public service reform in Ireland; and considered and compared approaches in other OECD States.</p>  <p>  The OECD assessment noted that the plan succeeded in completing the majority of the activities it set out to do and that the plan succeeded in creating a public-service wide approach to reform.  It particularly highlighted the significance of the plan in both creating an impetus for reform and identifying actions within each public service body to support the plan.  Key learnings from the OECD assessment informed the development of Our Public Service 2020, a new framework for development and innovation in the public service to 2020 and beyond, which I launched last December.</p>  <p>  In addition to the positive report from the OECD, a recent report by the Institute of Public Administration (Public Sector Trends 2017) includes many positive findings on the development and progress of our public services across the EU28.  This review which draws on data from the World Bank, the IMF and the OECD amongst other sources, found that:</p>  <p>  - Ireland&rsquo;s Public Administration comes first in the EU28 for being the most professional and least politicised.</p>  <p>  - Ireland comes 6th in the EU28 for the quality of its public administration (a relatively consistent score over last three years).</p>  <p>  - Ireland is 5th in the EU28 in the rating of perceptions that Government decisions are effectively implemented.</p>  <p>  Both the OECD assessment of the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16, and the IPA Public Sector Trends report demonstrate that Ireland&rsquo;s public services continue to perform well on an international stage and that there is a solid basis for continuous improvement and development of our public services.</p></reply>

The State buys everything from pens and paper, through to naval vessels and surgical equipment.  In this context, it is essential that the Public Service operates in a co-ordinated and efficient way and delivers much needed public services in a sustainable manner.  That is why the Government established the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).</p>  <p>  The OGP commenced operations in 2014 and, together with four key sectors (Health, Defence, Education and Local Government), has responsibility for sourcing goods and services on behalf of the Public Service.  In addition, the OGP also has responsibility for procurement policy and offers advice on procurement procedures.</p>  <p>  The OGP has progressed the National Public Procurement Policy Framework which enables a more consistent approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procurement procedures to be followed by public bodies.  Last July, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, launched new Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services.  This comprehensive interpretation of the public procurement directives has been designed to improve consistency and promote best practice in the application of the public procurement rules.  In addition, the OGP maintains a proactive line of communication with SME stakeholders to ensure they are informed of policy developments and that these are communicated by them to their members. </p>  <p>  The OGP together with four key sectors, speaks with &ldquo;one voice&rdquo; for the public service to the market for each category of expenditure, eliminating duplication and taking advantage of the scale of public procurement to best effect.  This move is in line with best practice in the public and private sector and is part of the continuing reform programme being driven by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed in the Programme for Partnership Government to examining the new procurement structures in place and where necessary make adjustments according to best international practice and in conjunction with Irish business. </p></reply>

In 2019 the Pension Related Deduction (PRD)will be converted to an Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) for public servants.</p>  <p>  Unwinding of the PSPR is taking place under FEMPI 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, provides for further significant lessening of the impact of PSPR by way of threshold and rate changes to apply on 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020.  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees, comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Act also provides an alternative statutory basis for the setting and varying of fees for contractors currently subject to the FEMPI legislation.  In future the relevant Government Minister, operating with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have the statutory power to set and vary the fees paid to contractors for goods and services based on a range of considerations, including affordability and value for money.</p></reply>

Staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by my Department and are not paid via grant funding.  The 1978 and 1979 schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme. </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services.  Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. </p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries and caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. </p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p><p>Circular 0078/2017: .  </p><p>Circular 0079/2017: </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrators recommendation applies.</p></reply>

My Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  This system uses data from a range of sources.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  Such exercises, involving all school planning areas including the areas referred to by the Deputies, are currently ongoing.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced in the coming weeks, after which patronage processes will be run to decide who will operate each school.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.

The procedures set out in Circular 0071/2014 may be commenced or ceased at different stages by the employer depending on the circumstances of the individual case concerned. The Circular does not set out exceptional circumstances and I have no plans to review this matter.</p>  <p>  As the Circular does not set out exceptional circumstances, my Department has no information on the number of transfers of teachers relying on such circumstances.

For example, the SPHE curriculum at primary level contains a strand on Media Education, and as with all curriculum content, teachers are enabled to mediate this to children. The PDST (Technology in Education) is a dedicated team established and funded by the Department to advise and support schools in the area of digital technologies, including issues of internet safety. Schools are advised on the following matters: the development and implementation of an Acceptable Usage Policy (governing the use of the internet in schools); the promotion of awareness regarding safety online; and the implementation of a content filtering/monitoring system.</p>  <p>  Through the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative which is funded by my department, resources are also provided to support teachers to integrate internet safety into teaching and learning in their schools. Webwise also provide information, advice, and tools to parents to support their engagement in their children&rsquo;s online lives. With the help of the Webwise Youth Advisory Panel they develop youth oriented awareness raising resources and campaigns that address topics such as social networking, sexting, cyber bullying.</p>  <p>  The Webwise Initiative is part of the Safer Internet Ireland Project coordinated by the Office for Internet Safety (an Executive Office of the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality)  to develop national initiatives promoting the safer use of electronic media and enhance protection of the vulnerable, particularly children, against the downside of the internet.  The project is a consortium of industry, education, child welfare and government partners that provide Safer Internet awareness, hotline and helpline functions and activities. Webwise promotes the autonomous, effective, and safer use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting parents, teachers, and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages.</p>  <p>  In 2017 alone there were in excess of 618,000 recorded users of the website (webwise.ie) with a total of 921,000 page views. Supporting resource booklets are free to order or download from Webwise.ie.</p>  <p>  There are no plans for a public campaign at this time.  My Department collaborates with a number of Departments with responsibility in this area. The Department of Justice and Equality has the lead role in coordinating Government policy concerning internet safety, through the Office for Internet Safety. The Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment  (DCCAE) Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills all have key roles.  </p></reply>

Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of this Department.</p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at .</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, this Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p></reply>

It also increases the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  At the heart of the GDPR is a &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo; approach to data protection.  This means that each data controller and data processor is required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure &ndash; and to be able to demonstrate &ndash; that their processing of personal data complies with the new data protection standards.</p>  <p>  The GDPR also imposes an obligation on data controllers and data processors involved in high risk processing to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) prior to the commencement of processing operations.  Where the DPIA indicates that risks identified in relation to the processing of personal data cannot be mitigated, the controllers and processors will be required to consult with the Data Protection Commission before engaging in the processing.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Data Protection Bill 2018 gives further effect to the GDPR in a number of areas in which the GDPR gives Member State a margin of flexibility.  During Seanad Report Stage, I tabled amendments to insert new sections 31 and 32 in the Bill, which will provide for increased protections for the personal data of children.  Section 31 provides that the Data Protection Commission will encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR with regard to the following:</p>  <p>  (a) the protection of children,</p>  <p>  (b) the information to be provided by a controller to children,</p>  <p>  (c) the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental responsibility over a child is to be obtained for the purposes of Article 8 of the GDPR, and</p>  <p>  (d)  integrating the necessary safeguards into processing in order to protect the rights of children in an age-appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  Section 32 introduces a specific &ldquo;right-to-be-forgotten&rdquo; for children.  This will strengthen the rights of children to erasure of any personal data collected during the provision to them of information society services referred to in Article 8.1 of the GDPR.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to possible future establishment of an Office of Digital Safety Commissions are being considered by the Minister and Department for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  In a related context, the European Commission is expected to announce proposals arising from its monitoring of online platforms' compliance with its Communication on Illegal Content Online later this year.</p></reply>

Issues of community identify and numbers of potential participants on GYDPs in the area will be key considerations here.</p>  <p>  The provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them.  I might add that an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by my Department is expected shortly.  This report will help with the further development of the Call for Proposals documentation.</p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of concerns expressed by youth justice workers and their representatives.  I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the ongoing consultation process.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the approach in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued.</p>  <p>  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.</p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.  I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers.  In this regard, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services.  Furthermore, I am advised that the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive e approach that is being developed.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength D.M.R West Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 667.  There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 53 Garda civilian staff attached to the D.M.R. West Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 155 have been assigned to the D.M.R.

West Division. </p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute; &quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a &ldquo;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. </p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.</p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities. </p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. </p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have provided in tabular form, in the attached document, the total strength and Community Garda&iacute;

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.660.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700070#WRN02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 to 312, inclusive, and 320 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults and it is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.</p><p>Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda National Vetting Bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p><p>Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. </p><p>At present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The e-vetting system is available to all registered organisations and I am informed that the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-vetting system to do so. In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.</p><p>That said, there are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant. Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p><p>Regarding the request for statistical information on vetting, I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the National Vetting Bureau does not keep statistics in respect of the number of individuals that have made multiple Garda vetting applications for different organisations.</p><p>I am further informed that the following tables provide a breakdown of the numbers of applications received and processed in 2015, 2016 and 2017.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Applications Received</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>497,026</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>389,548</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>349,910</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Applications Processed </th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>487,934</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>360,395 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>319,592 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy may appreciate that there is a natural variance between what is received and completed as there are applications on hand at the end of each year which would have been received within the turnaround time applicable. These applications are carried over to the start of the following year.</p></reply>

Every other job in the labour market where an employer cannot find a worker, may be eligible for an employment permit subject to certain criteria.  </p><p>Reviews of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) are undertaken twice annually to ensure that they reflect the exigencies of a changing labour environment.  Occupations designated highly skilled and on the HSEOL are eligible for Critical Skills Employment Permits.  </p><p>An occupation may be considered for inclusion on the HSEOL provided that:</p><p>- There are no suitable Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work;</p><p>- Development opportunities for Irish/EEA nationals are not undermined;</p><p>- Genuine skills shortage exists and that it is not a recruitment or retention problem;</p><p>- The Government education, training, employment and economic development policies are supported;</p><p>- The skill shortage exists across the occupation, despite attempts by industry to train and attract Irish/EEA nationals to available jobs.  </p><p>The rationale underpinning the inclusion on or omission from the lists of any particular occupation is driven by skills demands in the economy, and is based, in the first instance, on research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs for the National Skills Council.  This evidence is subsequently augmented by a public consultation process.  </p><p>The current HSEOL can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website, at: .  </p><p>The focus of the employment permit regime in recent years has been to ensure that the skills requirement of enterprise in the State can be met through economic migration where necessary.  However, as we approach full employment, labour as well as skills needs are beginning to manifest.  It is imperative that the employment permits system remains correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they labour or skills shortages.  Consequently, my Department is undertaking a review of our economic migration policy.  I have established an Inter Departmental Group to steer the review and have requested that it report to me by the end of June 2018.</p></reply>

As the first doses of these vaccines are administered to children when they reach two months, these changes took effect from 1 December, 2016.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF have responsibility for the development of this report, although Department Officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review.  The most recent update from the<i></i>NTPF is that the report will be finalised and ready for review in the first half of 2018.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on plans to introduce an independent appeal mechanism within the NHSS to provide third party recourse for nursing home providers that cannot agree a fee with the NTPF, I cannot nor would I wish to, prejudge the outcomes of the NTPF pricing mechanism review.  However I welcome the work to date and look forward to the NTPF concluding the review later this year.</p><p>In relation to variations in the cost of care for public and private nursing homes it is acknowledged that public nursing homes have, in general, a higher cost of care.  It is understood that a number of factors contribute to this such as; higher dependency levels of clients requiring a higher staff skill mix, environmental implications for staffing levels and the geographical provision of residential placements.</p><p>That said, there is a need to undertake a deeper analysis of the factors driving the higher costs of care in public units.  This is why the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme identified the need for a Value for Money and Policy (VFM) review of the cost differentials in public and private/voluntary residential facilities. </p><p>The aim of this review is to identify and analyse these factors.  The VFM review will also make recommendations on how the differentials can be addressed.  This review has recently commenced and is being led by my Department.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The NTPF has responsibility for the development of this report, although Department Officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review. The most recent update from the NTPF is that the report will be finalised and ready for review in the first half of 2018.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on plans to introduce an independent appeal mechanism within the NHSS to provide third party recourse for nursing home providers that cannot agree a fee with the NTPF, I cannot nor would I wish to, prejudge the outcomes of the NTPF pricing mechanism review. However I welcome the work to date and look forward to the NTPF concluding the review later this year.</p></reply>

The manufacturer, CSL Behring, was notified in August 2017 that the HSE was unable to recommend reimbursement. The HSE concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest that patients would derive a clinically meaningful benefit from this treatment and that the current price was not a cost effective use of resources. </p>  <p>  A number of patients were on an access scheme for this product, operated by the manufacturer, for the treatment of Alpha-1 deficiency. This scheme was being run independently by the manufacturer without reference to the HSE. </p>  <p>  Late last year the company decided to terminate the access scheme.  Following interventions by the HSE, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme for a further six months, or until the next clinical trial commences in mid 2018, but stipulated that it would not cover the cost of administering the medicine.</p>  <p>  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement, under which it would fund the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients would continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences in 2018.  The terms of this transitional arrangement, under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug, include a requirement that the lead clinician (who is the patients' treating consultant) ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place in good time for those patients not proceeding onto the next trial.</p>  <p>  The HSE is liaising with the treating consultant and the pharmaceutical company in relation to the longer term care of this group of patients and in order to ensure that appropriate care arrangements are in place for each patient in advance of an anticipated further clinical trial which is expected to begin later in 2018.</p>  <p>  The HSE has asked that the plan for the longer term care of this group of patients would be finalised without delay.  </p>  <p>  This transitional arrangement does not alter the reimbursement decision of the HSE in relation to Respreeza.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the company that it is willing to undertake a timely review of any new application for reimbursement.</p></reply>

It is also available in single ingredient, non-prescription products, as a cough suppressant. These authorised products are available without a prescription through retail pharmacy businesses (pharmacies) only. </p><p>The Pharmacy Act 2007 and the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008 require that all medicines supplied through a pharmacy must be supplied by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and that all non-prescription medicines supplied must be the subject of appropriate counselling. </p><p>The Pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) issued guidance to pharmacists on the safe supply of non-prescription products containing codeine in 2010. This Guidance was updated in 2015 and most recently in October 2017. The Guidance covers the requirements set out above and in addition contains further restrictions which apply to the supply of codeine based products.  </p><p>These restrictions include a requirement that codeine based products are not available to the public for self-selection and should only be supplied when a pharmacist deems such a supply to be necessary and only when a non-opioid analgesic, e.g. paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen, has not proven sufficient to relive the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. The Guidance also states that codeine medicines should be used for the shortest time possible and for no longer than three days without medical supervision. Pharmacists must also ensure that patients are advised of the importance of adhering to the recommended dosage and duration of use as well as the risks associated with overdose and or/prolonged use. Patients should also be counselled in respect of potential adverse reactions or side effects. </p><p>The full Guidance document, along with information on current legislative requirements, is available on the PSI website: //thepsi.ie/Libraries/Folder_Pharmacy_Practice_Guidance/01_3_Safe_supply_of_Codeine_to_patients.sflb.ashx.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanism by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee this review which is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NTPF has responsibility for the development of this report, although Department Officials continue to engage with the NTPF regarding the review.  The most recent update from the NTPF is that the report will be finalised and ready for review in the first half of 2018.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on plans to introduce an independent appeal mechanism within the NHSS to provide third party recourse for nursing home providers that cannot agree a fee with the NTPF, I cannot, nor would I wish to, prejudge the outcomes of the NTPF pricing mechanism review.  However I welcome the work to date and look forward to the NTPF concluding the review later this year.</p></reply>

(Statutory Instrument No. 675 of 2006).  Live exports are an important component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry and my Department promotes an environment in which live exports take place with a strong emphasis on the welfare of all animals being exported. A considerable amount of resources is deployed to the process of certifying animals for export and in ensuring compliance in respect of the welfare of the animals being exported.  My Department is regularly in contact with the Competent Authorities in other Member States through which live animals pass  en route to their final destination. The purpose of these contacts is to ensure that the regulations in place regarding rest, feed and water are obeyed regardless of the location of the animals or the transport vehicle or vessel. For instance, where transporters are suspected of failing to obey the regulations on the protection of live animals during transport in Ireland or other Member States, there is a system in place for official notifications to the Member State of origin of the journey and the Member State where the transporter is authorised.  Any such official notifications are investigated and where there are non-compliances appropriate sanctions are applied to the transporters and organisers of the journey. In terms of the issue raised concerning the export of calves on a replacement ship, there are strict arrangements in place with the shipping companies engaged in transporting animals, to ensure adequate oversight of the animals when in transit. My Department is satisfied that these arrangements are working in a satisfactory manner and that the welfare of the calves is not compromised.</p>  <p>  With regard to the incident leading to the death of calves in the Netherlands, this appears to result from an unfortunate road traffic accident. The Dutch authorities are  investigating the circumstances of the accident. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner and with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported.</p></reply>

Teagasc provide strategic oversight in the form of business planning and technical support and also organise farm walks and visits etc. My Department does not directly aid the operation of these farms. </p>  <p>  The Greenfield Dairy Farm project was set up in 2010 to demonstrate best practise in the design, construction and operation of sustainable grass based milk production systems to Irish dairy farmers. Glanbia, the Agricultural Trust and the farm owners, formed a limited company (Greenfield Dairy Partners Limited), which leased the farm from the owners for a 15-year period. Teagasc  are not involved in the day-to-day operations on the farm. </p>  <p>  Like many other farms, Greenfield was impacted by the extreme weather associated with Storm Emma. Farm staff stayed on the farm for the entire duration of the storm to monitor the stock under the adverse conditions. Additional help was brought in to ensure that all animals were provided with adequate feed and water, which is the main animal welfare priority in such situations. </p>  <p>  Out of a total of 370 cows, there were 290 cows on the farm during the storm. In preparation for the storm, approximately 80 in-calf cows and 30 calves were moved to a nearby farmyard which provided more sheltered accommodation. Unfortunately over the 24-hour period, five calves and two cows died due to the adverse effects of Storm Emma; an additional calf died in the following 24-hours. </p>  <p>  Teagasc regrets the animal deaths that occurred, but faced with the large snowfall and drifting, are satisfied that everything that was humanly possible was done to alleviate the situation. Over the last 8 years, Greenfield has had a very good animal welfare record with cow and calf mortality, one of the key performance indicators that is recorded and reported weekly, significantly below national average rates. </p>  <p>  While an event such as Storm Emma is unlikely to be repeated during the lifetime of this project, Teagasc in association with its stakeholders will carry out a thorough review of the event. This will include a review of the farm infrastructure and recommendations as to how such adverse events are prepared for and alleviated in the future. Teagasc will also prepare a specific set of guidelines to help farmers to cope with extreme adverse events such as occurred with Storm Emma and Storm Ophelia.</p></reply>

The application system allows herd keepers to apply for Certificates of Compliance either manually or online.</p>  <p>  The current facility to record "feedlot movements" on AIM was introduced many years ago solely to assist in the establishment of stocking density for premia payments that is no longer applicable and therefore this movement type is no longer required.

Were the medium exploitation rate used for the Roughty, this would predict a much lower salmon stock and therefore a lower surplus available. </p>  <p>  The wetted area of Irish salmon rivers was first estimated in 2003 when the wetted area of Roughty was 86.9 hectares of accessible wetted area for salmon.  The estimation of salmon habitat was scientifically revised in 2012, and the revised wetted area for the Roughty was 95.2 hectares of which 81.3 hectares were accessible to salmon.  River specific salmon data in relation to egg deposition is used to calculate each river&rsquo;s individual conservation limit.</p>  <p>  Other factors in relation to the make-up of each river&rsquo;s individual stock also impact the conservation limit.  When compared to the Bandon, the lower average weight of one sea winter salmon on the Roughty combined with a lower proportion of large salmon (multi-sea-winter fish) results in a greater salmon egg requirement /m2  and therefore a higher salmon conservation limit for the Roughty river than if conservation limit was based solely on wetted area. </p>  <p>  As each salmon river has its own genetically unique stock and the component parts of the stock vary, the issue of establishing a conservation limit can be complex.  In that regard, I will provide a detailed account of the methodologies for calculating wetted area and establishing conservation limits, including scientific references, for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ireland has transposed all EU Directives relating to air quality.  The Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (2008/50/EC) was published in May 2008, and was transposed into Irish legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 180 of 2011), as amended.  In addition, Directive 2004/107/EC (relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air) was transposed into Irish legislation by the Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ambient Air Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 58 of 2009), as amended.The limit values set out in these pieces of legislation are available online at the following link:</p><p><i><i></i></i></p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) most recent annual Air Quality Report was published in November 2017 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2016 and goes into detail about how the results compare to the European standards.  Values for all network sites were below the EU annual limit value, but exceeded the stricter World Health Organisation guideline values for a number of pollutants at individual sites.  The report can be found at the following link:</p><p><i><i></i></i></p><p>The 7<sup>th</sup>European Action Programme includes the objective of ensuring that outdoor air quality in the EU will have improved significantly by 2020, moving closer to World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.  This is an ambition which Ireland shares.</p><p>In parallel with the requirements of the CAFE Directive, Ireland is subject to, and compliant with, the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NEC) Directive 2001/81/EC, which was transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 303/2012 - European Communities (National Emissions Ceiling) (Amendment) Regulations 2012.  The NEC Directive sets upper limits, or &ldquo;ceilings&rdquo; for national emissions from each EU Member State.  The pollutants covered include sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ammonia (NH3).  </p><p>These targets are set out in the European Communities (National Emission Ceilings) Regulations 2004, which are available online at the following link:</p><p><i><i></i></i></p><p>A revised NEC Directive (Directive 216/2284) is due to be transposed later this year and sets stricter targets for 2020 and 2030, while also including fine particulate matter (PM2.5).</p><p>In support of these pieces of legislation which set air pollution standards, there are numerous Directives and Regulations, such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU), the Medium Combustion Plants Directive (Directive EU/2015/2193), the Paints Directive (Directive 2004/42/CE) and the Non-Road Mobile Machinery Regulation (Regulation EU/2016/1628),  which impose limits on emissions from various sources.  </p><p>In recognition of the fact that air pollution has greater impact on health at lower levels than was previously understood, I am preparing to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first ever National Clean Air Strategy, which will provide the strategic policy framework to identify and promote the required integrated measures across Government to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while also delivering on wider social and economic objectives.</p><p>An important part of the strategy will be an expansion of the current air quality monitoring network.The new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) is being developed by the EPA under section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  The AAMP will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available.  I fully support this important initiative, and have committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. </p></reply>

Section 26 of the same Act gives the Local Authority powers to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission, where it appears necessary in order to prevent or to limit air pollution.  It is a matter for the Local Authority to exercise its judgement in any individual case as to whether a nuisance is being caused, and if so, what abatement action is required.  In circumstances where a complaint has been made to the relevant Local Authority and the complainant is not satisfied with the action taken by that Authority, a further complaint can be made to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The EPA will review the Local Authority's performance and assist where possible.  The EPA will not become involved until the relevant Local Authority has first been given an opportunity to investigate the complaint.  Information on how to make an environmental complaint has been prepared by the EPA and can be viewed on the EPA website, <i><i>www.epa.ie/enforcement/report/</i></i>.</p></reply>

In terms of the number and extent of publicly accessible charging, the National Policy Framework on the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland: 2017 to 2030 notes that Ireland&rsquo;s current EV charging network infrastructure is ahead of current market demand.  However, it is recognised that the future development of the EV public charging does need to progress alongside the growth of electric vehicles.</p><p>The existing fleet of public chargers was rolled out by the ESB, through its eCars programme, and there are approximately 900 EV charge points in Ireland of which circa 70 are rapid chargers.  A map showing the charge points, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB's website at <i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i>.  The operation and repair of these charge points are operational matters for the ESB.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the future ownership of the EV charging infrastructure in October 2017, determining that in keeping with EU provisions, the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.<font color="#0D0D0D">The decision  envisages the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years, ensuring no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.</font>In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Funding has, therefore, been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes. </p><p>To support home charging, I introduced the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant scheme this year. This Scheme, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600 for buyers of both new and second-hand EVs.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the council.</p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for specific improvement grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of rural roads, including bridges, where the proposed scheme cost generally less than &euro;5 million.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The capital plan does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.

Studies show that young drivers and inexperienced drivers are more likely to die or be seriously injured in collisions, and the essential driver training, EDT, the course of 12 one-hour lessons, is one of several measures introduced by the RSA to help improve critical driving knowledge, skills and behaviours of new drivers.  However, the completion of the 12 certified lessons does not guarantee that a learner driver has reached the required level of competence in driving.  This is proven by the fact that the fail rate of driving tests undertaken by candidates who completed EDT lessons was 47.38% in 2016.  This fail rate is the average rate across all test centres, not just in Mullingar.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that there is a cost involved in the process of obtaining a driving licence, however I believe that the cost of the driving test is not particularly high as against the cost to the authority concerned to provide the service.  The fee is for a certificate of competency which must be produced to obtain a driving licence.  The driving test is the means to determine the competency of a driver.  It would not be appropriate to offer a reduced fee to a driver if they have failed to meet the criteria and have to sit the test again.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority, NTA, has statutory responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, GDA, including traffic management.  As the Deputy is aware, the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades.  Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the strategy.  The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  NTA and DCC jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study in 2015 which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre.  In preparing the study, Dublin City Council and the NTA reviewed the current and future transportation needs of the city centre, and the report noted that as the economy continues its recovery and employment rises, without positive intervention, increased congestion and longer journey times on the key routes to Dublin City, and within the city centre itself, will become an increasing feature of the city.  The report also acknowledged that with the introduction of the Luas cross city project, Luas trams would be caught up in traffic congestion, and that the service reliability would be prone to disruption due to general traffic.  Similarly the report also acknowledged the impact to the reliability of the bus network given the interaction with other road traffic.  The report recognised that a rebalancing of the available road space will be required on various streets to facilitate the introduction of additional capacity for public transport, cycling and walking.  Significant changes to the traffic network in the city centre will be necessary, with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.    </p>  <p>  NTA and DCC, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, are progressively implementing the measures set out in that document to enable the continued development and growth of the city with the objective of guaranteeing that the overall transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times.  As the Deputy is aware, the City Council's College Green plaza proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination, and if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green.   </p>  <p>  Looking to the future, as Minister for Transport I have ensured that Budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021.  The 4 year envelope will allocate investment to fund projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, will continue investment in Dublin's light rail network, cycling and walking and traffic management measures in our capital and beyond.  These programmes will be implemented by the NTA which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the GDA. </p>  <p>   Furthermore, Government&rsquo;s Public Transport investment priorities are also set out in the recently published National Development Plan, NDP.  The NDP seeks to protect the quality and value of the existing assets and  deliver a multi-modal public transport network that will provide high-quality passenger interchange points, which facilitate convenient transfer between efficient and integrated public transport services.  All the planned investment in public transport combined will add greatly to the choice and experience of the travelling public, connecting more people with more places and ease congestion in Ireland&rsquo;s cities.</p></reply>

The fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution would exceed the amount currently available for individual larger projects under the SCP. All projects funded under the scheme will be subject to the public spending code and State aid requirements.  In terms of calls for proposals, it is envisaged that the views of the national governing bodies of sport and local authorities would be sought regarding the prioritisation of projects for possible inclusion.</p></reply>

I advised at that time that it is difficult to identify any the benefit or added value for legislation, or clearly identify what the purpose of any legislation would be, to establish a stand alone Coast Guard. I have not heard any compelling arguments to convince me otherwise in the meantime. The Coast Guard is functioning very effectively as a Division of my Department and its role is supported through various legislative instruments. </p>  <p>  Legislating for a stand alone agency is an inherently complex task and the volunteer dimension of the Coast Guard's activities adds to that complexity.  Volunteers are not, as individuals, bound by employee or contract law and offer their services freely on a voluntary basis. In my address to the Seanad, I cited the example of the Civil Defence Act, which does not contain any provisions in respect of its large volunteer force.  My records show that I last received an external representation concerning legislating for the Coast Guard in May 2017.  I have had no recent representations from volunteers on the matter.</p></reply>

Accordingly, in the interests of equity and fairness, an appeals system was introduced for the 2017 round and will be available for all future rounds of the SCP.</p>  <p>  Regarding the appeal process, each appeal submitted was assessed by an official not involved in the original assessment of that application.  All decisions on appeal were also reviewed by at least two more senior officials.  No external appeals board was established.</p>  <p>  A total of 149 appeals were submitted and of these, 35 were upheld.  Appeals were accepted where the appellant demonstrated that the Department erred in its decision to make the application invalid, or where it was agreed that the Department's own guide to making an application was not sufficiently clear, or where it was felt the original decision involved an overly strict interpretation of the SCP terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  All organisations that submitted an invalid or partially invalid application were contacted offering them the opportunity to submit an appeal and all of the appellants have now been informed of the results of the appeal process.</p>  <p>  In relation to future rounds of the SCP, my Department is now undertaking a general review of the 2017 round with a view to making recommendations on how to improve the process for future calls.  This work is also examining what is feasible in terms of the scale and timing of the next round.  I expect this review to be complete shortly and an announcement regarding the next round of the SCP will be made at that stage.  All applicants under the 2017 round of the programme that remain invalid have been informed that they will be given the opportunity of simply submitting corrected documentation when the next round of the programme opens without the requirement of submitting a full new application.</p></reply>

As outlined in the recently published 'National Development Plan 2018-2027: Project Ireland 2040' (NDP), the DART Expansion Programme is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART Network for Dublin with all of the lines linked and connected over the period of the plan.</p>  <p>  The initial sequencing of investment under the NDP will focus on delivery of non-underground tunnel elements of the Programme using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park (which has provided the option for Kildare commuters to access the city centre stations of Connolly, Tara Street and Pearse).  This sequencing and focus includes buying additional fleet for the DART network and measures such as re-signalling, junction and station changes to provide expanded services.  The next step will be to provide fast, high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda on the Northern Line, Celbridge/Hazelhatch on the Kildare Line, Maynooth and M3 Parkway on the Maynooth/Sligo Line, while continuing to provide DART services on the South-Eastern Line as far south as Greystones.  It will also include new stations to provide interchange with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.</p>  <p>  The significant benefit to using the recently opened rail link and existing connector tunnel under the Phoenix Park and the proposed sequence of investment is that it will enable additional passenger services to be put in place much earlier using existing infrastructure with some enhancements.  This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Maynooth and Celbridge/Hazelhatch as well as Drogheda and Greystones.  The route for the remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme, the DART Undeground Tunnel, will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Valuation Office falls under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that the Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Under Schedule 4, paragraph 22, community childcare facilities are exempt from commercial rates, by virtue of the fact that they operate on a not-for-profit basis. The Valuations Office have also advised that, under Schedule 4 paragraph 10, facilities who provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) only are exempt from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  Officials from this Department have met with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality &ndash; under whose ageis the Valuation Office formerly fell&ndash; to discuss the issue of commercial rates for childcare providers. At this meeting it was re-iterated that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable, and that this applies to private childcare facilities offering services over and above ECCE only.  </p>  <p>  My Department sought legal advice in respect of private for-profit childcare facilities to establish if there may be grounds for exemption under the Act. The legal advice received confirmed that childcare facilities established for the purposes of making a profit are indeed rateable, and that no exemptions apply, other than as outlined above.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to the provision of affordable and accessible childcare, and will continue to engage on this matter as appropriate.</p></reply>

The Act also proposes (by way of the insertion of a new Part IVA) a substantial amendment to the Child Care Act 1991 creating a legislative framework within which special care procedures can be governed. </p>  <p>  Under the new provisions the High Court may make a special care order where it is satisfied that the child has attained 11 years of age and that the child's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk of harm to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare and where the provision of continued care other than special care and treatment/services under the Mental Health Act 2001 is not adequate to address the therapeutic requirements of the child. </p>  <p>  The High Court has discretion regarding the requirement for a consultation procedure with parents and their child and in relation to the requirement for a family welfare conference prior to the granting of the order. The special care order has effect for a maximum of three months from the date of the order and must be reviewed in each four-week period for which the order has effect.  </p>  <p>  The High Court is obliged to reassess the requirement for the original order and may vary the order on review.  Reviews of the special care order can be heard even where the child is in special care outside the State. The High Court is granted the power to extend the original order for a maximum of two further three-month periods (the maximum duration of a  special  care order is nine months) where it is deemed that the  child is benefitting from the treatment or where the circumstances warranting the original order continue to exist. The renewal applications must be made prior to the expiration of the original order/repeat order and the extension takes effect at the expiry of the original order/repeat order as the case demands. </p>  <p>  The commencement of the relevant provisions of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011, in conjunction with the making of commencement orders for provisions contained in the Health Act 2007 and the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, has resulted in a legal framework for the making of special care orders by the High Court and whereby all special care units are to be registered and inspected by HIQA (in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 2007). It might also be noted that new (HIQA) standards for special care units, agreed between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Tusla and HIQA, are also now operational.</p>  <p>  The commencement of this new regulatory regime, with effect from 1 January, 2018, is particularly relevant in light of the most recent amendment to the Constitution providing for the rights of the child.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011 provides for a transitional phase for special care units of 12 months &ndash; and during this phase they are deemed to be registered for the purposes of the Health Act 2007. Therefore, HIQA&rsquo;s formal registration of all Tusla special care units must be concluded by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department worked closely with colleagues in Tusla and HIQA in relation to the drafting of all relevant Regulations and standards. I have been informed by Tusla that the Agency has been preparing for special care registration for the last twelve months and a senior manager has been reassigned to ensure that special care units are ready for registration. The Service Director for Residential and Special Care has been in discussion with HIQA and will make the necessary applications for Registration as agreed with HIQA on the 12th of April 2018.  Special Care Services are currently preparing for registration inspections following these applications.</p></reply>

This increased Tusla's budget for the Programme to just under &euro;16.5m. The additional funding provided is being used to support existing Family Resource Centres, and has also provided for expansion of the Programme with the addition of eleven new centres.</p>  <p>  Following a public application process, Tusla recently announced the eleven centres which are being included in the Programme this year.</p>  <p>  I understand from Tusla that the applications to join the Family Resource Centre Programme were of a very high standard. The criteria considered included the size and make-up of the geographical area; the social and economic conditions of the specified area; and the overall population breakdown of the area that would be serviced by the centre. The criteria also considered the structure of the organisation applying to the programme; its objectives, targets, and current relationships with other organisations; and the inclusion of available research, community projects, and needs assessments with the application.</p>  <p>  Tusla received a high number of applications - 47 in total - for inclusion in the programme. One of the applications was for a centre in the Longford area. Tusla was faced with a difficult decision making process in securing eleven new centres for inclusion in the programme. </p>  <p>  It is important that the needs of children and families are met in the best way possible, particularly in areas of disadvantage. I will continue to support the work of Family Resource Centres and family support services throughout the country.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, a three-year Disbursement Scheme is prepared which sets out the priority areas for funding, underpinned by annual Action Plans which outline specific programmes to be funded each year.</p>  <p>  The current Disbursement Scheme covering the period 2017-2019 and the previous Disbursement Scheme for 2013-2016 both include a provision to enable the delivery of measures to people who are homeless through the provision of non-accommodation based facilities such as drop-in/day centres.  It is a matter for relevant line Departments to develop specific proposals in relation to this objective, for inclusion in the annual Dormant Accounts Action Plan.  However, to date, no specific measures addressing this provision have emerged in subsequent Plans.</p>  <p>  It would similarly be a matter for the relevant Department sponsoring a specific measure in the Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to collect data on the implementation of that measure.  </p>  <p>  Following the transfer to my Department in July 2017 of functions relating to the Dormant Accounts Funds legislation, my Department now coordinates the preparation of the Disbursement Scheme and the Annual Action Plans across Government. The preparation of the 2018 Action Plan has commenced and Minister Kyne recently wrote to each Minister requesting them to identify potential measures within their areas of responsibility for inclusion in the new Plan.</p>  <p>  With regard to the review of the 2013-2016 Disbursement Scheme, the key focus of that review is to address the points raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to the administration of the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme, and to ensure that the significant resources currently available from the fund are used in an efficient and effective manner. As part of this work, the review will consider whether the current operation of Disbursement Schemes is resulting in any unforeseen barriers to the funding of appropriate measures in any particular policy area across Government.   </p></reply>

The setting of retirement age remains a matter for agreement between employers/employees and the employment contract. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government believes that labour market practices should evolve to reflect the reality that as people live longer and healthier lives, many people wish to, and can, work longer and make a positive contribution through their work to our society. </p>  <p>  This is why the recently launched &lsquo;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023&rsquo; confirms future commitments on top of a range of actions already taken to support a positive ageing environment, where older people are, to the greatest extent possible, encouraged and facilitated in participating in the workforce.</p>  <p>  To this end, and with the input of the social partners, the Workplace Relations Commission recently published a &lsquo;Code of Practice on Longer Working&rsquo;.  The code informs best practice in managing the engagement between employers and employees in the run up to retirement.  This includes requests to work beyond what might be considered the &lsquo;normal retirement age&rsquo; in the employment concerned.  Following publication of this code, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will now prepare and publish guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined that the provisions detailed in the Roadmap for Pensions Reform will combine to result in greater employee flexibility in the retirement decision.  To ensure this is the case, employment practices in this area will be kept under close review in the near term.  Should it appear that these provisions are not resulting in improved flexibility for workers by the end of 2018, the Government will actively consider measures to restrict the capacity to use mandatory retirement provisions relative to the prevailing State pension age.  To this end an Interdepartmental Group chaired by my Department will be convened to review practices in this area.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Class S contributions do not provide access to short-term social insurance benefits such as illness benefit.   However, the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme may be available to those who are experiencing financial difficulty.  Self-employed contributors have been covered for invalidity pension since December 2017.  This gives the self-employed access to a safety-net of income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of a long-term illness or disability without a means test. </p>  <p>  I have already indicated the Government&rsquo;s intention to examine the further extension of benefits to self-employed people.  In doing this, it will take account of results of the 2017 survey of self-employed workers, which indicated that self-employed people are open to paying a higher rate of social insurance in return for additional benefits, and the actuarial review of the social insurance fund which was undertaken by KPMG and published last year.</p>  <p>  The actuarial review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising to &euro;223 million in 2020.  The review indicated that PRSI rates for the self-employed would need to increase from the current level of 4% to 7.8% to ensure a revenue neutral outcome.</p></reply>

The means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse/partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments. </p>  <p>  The purpose of means testing payments is to ensure that resources are directed to those with the most financial need, with the expectation that those with resources will use them to support themselves.  The weekly entitlement of the person is the maximum weekly rate of payment for the relevant family less the means calculated. In calculating the means of a person, outgoings such as rent, mortgage payments or, as in this case, monies going in to a trust fund are not disregarded.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the income disregard and means test for carers is one of the most generous within the social protection system.  The amount of weekly income that is currently not taken into account is &euro;332.50.  In the case of the income of a couple, the first &euro;665 of their combined weekly income is disregarded. </p>  <p>  In the case of funds on trust, the key issue for means testing purposes is the ownership of such funds.  Trust funds which are owned by a child of a claimant are not assessable on a capital basis when determining the means of a parent who is a welfare claimant.  Once monies are placed into a trust fund for another person, the capital value of that trust fund is not assessable if the claimant is no longer the owner of the funds.</p></reply>

The Government has confirmed its intention to proceed with that policy in its recently published Roadmap for Pensions Reform.  To that end, and to inform the final design of the system, a public consultation will be conducted later this year, and the necessary legislative, technical and administrative arrangements will be determined and developed thereafter.</p>  <p>  The Government also announced in January that those affected by the 2012 rateband changes will also have the option of availing of a TCA-based pension, if it is to their advantage.  The TCA model being made available to them will award a maximum rate pension for those with 40 years contributions (including up to 20 years HomeCaring credits), and pro-rata payments for those with fewer contributions.  Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from the 30th March 2018.  Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture. Instead, the Department will invite pensioners, who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012, to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  However legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence in the 4th Quarter of this year, with the first payments being made in the 1st Quarter of 2019. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In this case, no further evidence relating to the insurance record of the person concerned has, to date, been submitted to the Appeals Office for further consideration.</p>  <p>  The Chief Appeals Officer has power under Section 318 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to revise any decision where it appears to her that the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.  A request for such a review by the Chief Appeals Officer may be made by writing to her at the Social Welfare Appeals Office, D&rsquo;Olier House, D&rsquo;Olier Street, Dublin 2.  If the person concerned decides to take this course of action, it will be necessary for the person to set down specifically the reasons why he believes the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision to be incorrect having regard to her interpretation or application of the law or the facts.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (Section 327) also provides that any person who is dissatisfied with either the decision of the Appeals Officer or of a revised decision made by the Chief Appeals Officer may appeal that decision or revised decision, as the case may be, to the High Court on any question of law.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They only include the appeal processing times for schemes paid on a weekly basis. </p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  </p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s deciding officers are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  </p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first two months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals Processing Times by Weekly Paid Scheme 01/01/2012 &ndash; 31/12/2012</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>27.7</td><td>40.4</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>24.4</td><td>34.7</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>33.5</td><td>42.5</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>27.3</td><td>35.3</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>34.2</td><td>40.6</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>41.9</td><td>50.3</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>27.6</td><td>45.4</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance</td><td>24.5</td><td>39.5</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>23.4</td><td>44.9</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement *</td><td>22.8</td><td>31.2</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>38.8</td><td>48.7</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>29.4</td><td>44.6</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>30.8</td><td>41.7</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>33.2</td><td>59.4</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Con)</td><td>27.7</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>25.1</td><td>49.1</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>19.5</td><td>66.9</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)</td><td>78.7</td><td>87.4</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>14.2</td><td>48.8</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td><td>25.8</td><td>49.1</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td>32.0</td><td>58.8</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>54.6</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>22.8</td><td>38.2</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>24.4</td><td>34.4</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>20.9</td><td>30.8</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td>17.6</td><td>22.9</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Contributory)</td><td>27.1</td><td>60.5</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non- Contributory)</td><td>30.9</td><td>39.1</td></tr></table></p><p>* Now known as Working Family Payment</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to assess the specific cost of State pension (contributory) to those affected by the implementation of the provision as it is not possible to identify these &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo;.   They make a normal Class S self-employed contribution and qualify for social welfare entitlements on that basis.  However, at the time of the introduction of the provision, numbers affected were thought to be relatively small.  Census 2011 data suggested that prior to the change, the exclusion from social insurance affected less than 6,000 assisting spouses/civil partners who assist in family businesses.  The 2011 data indicated that there were 5,872 &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo; of which 3,315 were female and 2,557 were male.  Some of these &ldquo;assisting relatives&rdquo; could have been family members other than spouses/civil partners.</p>  <p>  In addition, many spouses/civil partners who were affected by the exclusion from social insurance and who gained access to State pension contributory in their own right, may already have been entitled to the means tested increase for a qualified adult.  Therefore the incremental costs of entitlement to State pension contributory are unlikely to be significant.</p></reply>

However, it does authenticate customer identities in a face-to-face engagement, including the capture of a photograph.</p>  <p>  In August 2017, my Department commenced inviting NDLS customers to complete SAFE 2 registration by post.  Invites were only issued to customers whose Public Services Identity data, supplied to the NDLS, matched the data held on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection&rsquo;s system and whose interaction with the NDLS had taken place since March 2014. This eliminated the need for the invitee to attend at an Intreo centre or a dedicated SAFE Registration centre specifically for the purpose of registering to SAFE 2.</p>  <p>  If the customer chose to avail of this option, they were required to complete the form supplied with the invitation.  If the customer chose not to complete the process, no further invite was issued. </p>  <p>  As part of the process, the customer also had to consent to the Department using the photograph, already captured in a face-to-face interaction with the NDLS to complete the SAFE 2 process.  Once the customer has completed the SAFE 2 registration process, a Public Services Card may issue. </p>  <p>  The legal basis for sharing data is provided in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended and is prescribed to certain specified bodies and only for the purposes of public service transactions.  The list of specified bodies that may use PSI data under Sections 260-265 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) is contained in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act and includes the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority. </p>  <p>  As Data Controller, for the Public Services Identity, my Department is obligated to ensure, as far as is possible, that the data it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  Legislation also provides that, where a specified body collects from a person any of his/her PSI data, that information shall also be collected for the purpose of maintaining the person&rsquo;s public service identity.  </p>  <p>  A data sharing agreement is currently being formalised with the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority, in line with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities</p>  <p>  Since 1st February 2017, all participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme also applies.  This new measure ensures that places become available to provide opportunities for other farmers and fishermen to take part in the scheme.  There are currently no plans to change the eligibility conditions for persons over 55 years of age.  RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  This includes having an entitlement to one of the qualifying social welfare payments and maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assist.  </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s provides part-time temporary work in the communities, as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a long term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  However, T&uacute;s placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  T&uacute;s is designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.  T&uacute;s participants work for an average of 19.5 hours a week and placements last for maximum of 12 months.  </p>  <p>  The twelve month duration of the T&uacute;s contract is set to reflect a number of inter-related elements.  These include the need to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers.  There are no plans to extend the scheme to longer than a 12 months duration or change the eligibility conditions for persons over 55 years of age.  After three years, a person can become eligible for a further 12 month placement on T&uacute;s.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. </p>  <p>  In the five years since the end of December 2012, there has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed.  In this context the Department is currently engaging with the Irish Local Development Network &ndash; the representative body for the IBs.</p>  <p>  The Department keeps all aspects of its activation programmes under review to ensure the best outcomes for participants and communities.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.1450.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700085#WRCC03900"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, JobPath is a service that supports people who are long-term unemployed to obtain and sustain paid employment.  The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  The aim of the service is to assist persons who are long term unemployed to find and sustain full-time paid employment in the open labour market.  The service assists long-term unemployed people through the provision of career advice, CV preparation support, interview skills training, job search supports and by working closely with employers to source vacancies that can be offered to jobseekers.  </p>  <p>  The service is distinct from the CE and T&Uacute;S schemes which provide part- time work experience and training opportunities as stepping stones back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments.  These schemes do not provide full-time sustainable employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are two phases to the JobPath service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  The duration of the client journey therefore necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting and the updating of individual cohort outcome data over time, as amd when more jobseekers complete their engagement period with the service.</p>  <p>  My Department has published initial cohort based reports on the performance of the service, with the latest being published on welfare.ie in January 2018.  This report detailed employment outcomes for customer cohorts referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.  </p>  <p>  Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during this period, 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  The total employment outcome across all four cohorts at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full-time employment, in addition a further 4% of clients entered part-time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.  It is important to note, that the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016), represent 80% of the 39,603 jobseekers referred between July 2015 and June 2016, and the employment outcomes are expected to improve over time as more  jobseekers from these cohorts complete their full engagement period with the service.</p>  <p>  The figures presented for JobPath provided by the Deputy are misconceived as they do not correctly relate to the service and as they seek to compare the service and the participation costs for other schemes, this is to misunderstand the service.  However taking the deputies approach, the cost per jobseeker supported by the service in the period between July 2015 and June 2016, can be estimated by taking the numbers who participated during the period (circa 39,600 jobseekers) and the payments from the Department during the same period (which amounted to approximately &euro;11.6m) giving a cost per participant of approximately &euro;300. </p>  <p>  The actual cost of the service, over the term of the contract, will be determined by a combination of factors such as, the profile of jobseekers on the live register, the number of people who are referred to the service by the Department and critically, the number of Jobseekers who are successfully placed into sustainable full time paid employment. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the quoted amounts paid in fees to JobPath providers to date are gross figures i.e. the associated savings in social welfare payments have not been deducted.  This is a key feature of a payment by results model of contracting which has been undertaken with regards to JobPath: i.e. job sustainment fee payments are only made were a jobseeker has obtained and sustained paid employment of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks duration were the former jobseeker was not entitled to a jobseekers related payment during that period. </p>  <p>  Given the extended time a Jobseeker may engage with the service and the increase in referral numbers over the reported timeframe the results are positive.  These initial cohort reports are however subject to review and are based on a relatively small sample size.  With this in mind, the department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of Q3 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

There are approximately 904,000 customers in receipt of free travel. </p>  <p>  Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments are eligible for the scheme.  The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.

The Government has confirmed its intention to proceed with that policy in its recently published Roadmap for Pensions Reform.  To that end, and to inform the final design of the system, a public consultation will be conducted later this year, and the necessary legislative, technical and administrative arrangements will be determined and developed thereafter.</p>  <p>  The Government also announced in January that those affected by the 2012 rateband changes will have the option of availing of a TCA-based pension, if it is to their advantage.  The TCA model being made available to them will award a maximum rate pension for those with 40 years contributions (including up to 20 years HomeCaring credits), and pro-rata payments for those with fewer contributions.  Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.</p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from the 30th March 2018.  Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture. Instead, the Department will invite pensioners, who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012, to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.  However legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence in the 4th quarter of this year, with the first payments being made in the 1st quarter of 2019. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In recognition of the crucial work undertaken in rural communities under the scheme, and as part of the social welfare budget package for 2018, I announced an additional 250 places to be rolled out this year together with an increase in the weekly rate of payment for participants from this week beginning 26 March 2018.  Taking into account the 500 additional places already allocated as part of the social welfare budget 2017, this brings the total number of RSS places to 3,350, nearly 30% of an increase in the last two years. </p>  <p>  In the context of savings to the Department as a result of the revised model of funding, it should be noted that all Implementing Bodies (IBs) will receive increased funding in 2018, compared to 2017, due to the provision of increased RSS places.  A budget of &euro;51.04m is provided for the RSS in 2018.  The provisional outturn in 2017 on RSS was &euro;44.4m.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that the Government strongly supports the work being done through the RSS and the vital role such schemes are playing in local communities, including supporting social services, across the entire country. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include the JobPath service. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of  the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register, aged between 18 and 61 years old inclusive, are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of system based stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.  </p>  <p>  The duration of a person's Jobseekers claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment. Jobseeker Allowance claims is made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks are considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims. Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that 52 week period.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are also available for selection for activation services including JobPath. </p>  <p>  Protocols for referral currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks on the JobPath programme within the previous 4 months although in practice it is generally 6 months..   A person who has completed a year with the JobPath service; continues to meet the criteria for long term unemployment and is not engaged in other activation supports and services becomes eligible for selection for a second period of activation with the JobPath service after 4 to 6 months.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  </p><p>There are two phases to the service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months. </p><p>The total number of clients who commenced an employment each year since service was launched is shown in the following table &ndash; <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Commenced Full-time Employment</th><th>Commenced Part-time Employment</th><th>Total Clients  commencing Employment</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,371</td><td>289</td><td>1,660</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>11,839</td><td>2,235</td><td>14,074</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>13,609</td><td>1,321</td><td>14,930</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>216</td><td>17</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>27,035</td><td>3,862</td><td>30,897</td></tr></table></p><p>*2018 figures are up to end of February.</p><p>To facilitate the Deputy in gaining an overview of the service I would call her attention to the published results for the service covering those referred between July 2015 and June 2016. These published reports provide information on customers who not only commenced employment but sustained employment.  The Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on Jobseekers not just finding a job but finding and sustaining their employment.  The companies are, for example, only paid a job outcome fee for each 13 week period of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.</p><p>It should also be noted that jobseekers are supported by the service for up to 30 months and as such the duration of the client journey necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting in order to produce accurate outcome data.  For this reason, the number of clients entering employment is expected to increase in time.</p><p>The Department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of the third quarter 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main purpose of these changes was to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme. </p>  <p>  The changes   for those on the live register see the general qualifying age for CE reduced from 25 to 21 years and are effective from 3rd July 2017.  It will also be easier for previous participants who have exhausted their CE entitlement to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 will be disregarded.  While participants between 21 and 55 years can avail of one year on the programme, this can be extended on approval by the Department by up to 2 more years, if they are working towards a major award/industry recognised equivalent to support their progression to employment.  CE participants aged 55 and over can now avail of up to 3 consecutive years on a scheme.  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to CE participants (7 years if on a disability payment).  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, provided they have not reached their 6 year limit. All CE places are now categorised into one of two strands, either activation, with a target progression of 50%, or social inclusion, with a target progression of 20%. </p>  <p>  The rural social scheme (RSS) provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen/women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities</p>  <p>  Since 1st February 2017, all participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme also applies.  This new measure ensures that places become available to provide opportunities for other farmers and fishermen to take part in the scheme. RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1st February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.  To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  This includes having an entitlement to one of the qualifying social welfare payments and maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assist.  </p>  <p>  T&uacute;s provides part-time temporary work in the communities, as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a long term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  T&uacute;s participants work for an average of 19&frac12; hours a week and placements last for maximum of 12 months. The twelve month duration of the T&uacute;s contract is set to reflect a number of inter-related elements. These include the need to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers . After three years, a person can become eligible for a further 12 month placement on T&uacute;s.  </p>  <p>  JobPath providers arrange for the delivery of a broad range of education and training courses with a particular strong focus on upskilling the long term unemployed. In order to support JobPath providers to refer people to training and education, the Department will extend the initial 12 month JobPath referral period by the duration of any externally delivered approved training course. This can be up to an additional 26 weeks. The JobPath companies remain in contact with the clients while they are on such courses.</p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support over a period of up to 12 months to help them tackle barriers to employment and to find jobs. If they are successful in securing employment the JobPath provider will continue to work with the client providing in-work support for a further period of up to 12 months.</p>  <p>  A person who has completed a year with the JobPath service; continues to meet the criteria for long term unemployment and is not engaged in other activation supports and services becomes eligible for selection for a second period of activation with the JobPath service after a period of 4 to 6 months.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including Part B (Fire Safety), rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in response to the many building failures that emerged in the last decade, my Department has been working on a building control reform agenda, including the following:</p>  <p>  - the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification;</p>  <p>  - working closely with the Local Government Management Agency on the oversight and governance of the local authority Building Control System to improve its effectiveness; and</p>  <p>  - progressing primary legislation, the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017, to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector.</p></reply>

The implementation of  Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and making significant progress. This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published in January, showing nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017. A breakdown of these numbers across all local authority areas, including Kilkenny County Council, will be made available following completion of the necessary validation process. </p><p>There are currently over 12,000 new social homes included in the Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects, which is now published on a quarterly basis and includes projects that are recently completed, on site, or undergoing planning and design. This list is being added to on an on-going basis and the most recent version, covering the period to end Quarter 3 of 2017, is available at the following link: <i><i></i></i>.</p><p>The Status Report includes construction projects of various scale being advanced by all local authorities, including Kilkenny County Council, in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies and these will be advanced as quickly as possible, as will further new projects brought forward by the local authorities. My Department currently has no proposal for the site at  Margaretsfield, Kilkenny, but a new targeted timeline for social housing construction projects has been put in place that sets out the optimum timeframe from initial project concept through to design, planning, procurement and mobilisation of contractor on site.  The programme puts an onus on all stakeholders to advance projects through the process in a timely manner.</p><p>Against the background of the affordability pressures which exist in the rental market, particularly in our cities and other major urban areas, the Government is determined to make cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system. To do this, we will offer more affordable long-term rental options, by leveraging the value of State land to reduce the cost of provision. Cost rental is new to Ireland and a number of pilot cost rental projects are currently being progressed in Dublin, for example, at Enniskerry Road and in Lusk. The projects are being delivered by Approved Housing Bodies, working with relevant local authorities, the Housing Agency and my Department.  The pilot projects are providing very valuable learning in terms of the design and delivery of such a new rental model in Ireland. Working with these and other key stakeholders, my Department is considering the optimal operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, taking account of broader policy considerations on affordable housing. </p><p>I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector and I am satisfied that delivery of the Plan remains firmly on track.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p><p>The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p><p>In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p><p>The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p><p>The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan. </p><p>In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p><p>The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. In finalising the report due consideration had to be given to possible arrangements for the implementation of the review recommendations. This is now almost complete and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.</p></reply>

The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. </p><p>HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet and on the dedicated HAP website, <i><i>www.hap.ie</i></i>, and local authority staff also explain them to each HAP applicant. </p><p>Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  Greater enhanced support is also statutorily provided for in the Dublin Region for homeless households. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Local authorities must also be cognisant of the provisions  of the Residential Tenancies Act when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord and my Department does not routinely collect data in relation to households in receipt of HAP who are making additional payments to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. Local Authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p><p>The data available to my Department  indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland. </p></reply>

A new Part B/TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017, in relation to dwellings. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates.  The existing TGD B volume 1 provides guidance on other building types, including buildings containing flats or apartments.  Work is currently underway on a revision to TGD B Volume 1.  </p><p>With regard to timber framed construction, in accordance with the recommendations of the Timber Frame Housing Report, a standard in relation to timber frame construction was developed.  Irish Standard 440: 2009/A1:2014 Timber Frame Construction, Dwellings and other Buildings (I.S. 440) specifies requirements for materials, design, manufacture, construction details, site work and quality control for platform timber frame construction.  It requires that the responsibilities for the tasks involved in the planning, structural design, site erection and inspection be agreed and recorded prior to the commencement of each project.  I.S. 440 also gives specific details relating to fire, including the construction of separating walls, horizontal and vertical fire stopping, cavity barriers and detailed fire stopping junctions for walls and floors and service penetrations.</p><p>I.S. 440 is currently under review and it is intended that both external and party wall new constructions and methods will be included in the next revision of the document.  Manufacturers of timber frame buildings are assessed under an approval scheme operated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for compliance with I.S. 440 requirements, including Factory Production Control (FPC), and a register of compliant manufacturers is available on the NSAI website at  <i><i>.</i></i></p><p>It should also be noted that my Department has recently issued guidance on Timber Frame Walls, which have been tested to the European fire test standard and meet the performance set down in Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) for external and separating walls in dwellings.  This has been transmitted to all registered users of the Building Control Management System and to all Building Control Authorities.</p><p>Under section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, responsibility for ongoing fire safety in buildings of all kinds (other than dwellings) is placed on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of each building.  In the case of a building containing flats or apartments, this may, for example, be an Owners Management Company. </p><p>Local fire authorities have powers of inspection, and where necessary enforcement, under the Building Control Act 1990 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. </p><p>Typically, in carrying out inspections under the Fire Services Acts, some or all of the following aspects will be reviewed &ndash; </p><p>- The passive or inbuilt fire safety features in a building, such as the layout and escape routes from the building and the construction of the building; the required passive fire safety features relating to the use of the building and the scale and occupancy;</p><p>- The active fire safety features, such as fire detection and alarm systems, which alert persons on the premises to the danger of fire and enable them to use the means of escape;</p><p>- The management of the building, including management of fire safety, to prevent fires occurring in the first place and to manage building services and fire safety to ensure that safety is not compromised. </p><p>Guidance on these features is generally set out in relevant guidance documents and codes of practice rather than in specific legislation or regulation.  My Department has published guidance documents and codes of practice for a range of building types. </p><p>A fire authority may require a &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; over a building, or an owner or occupier of such a building, to carry out a fire safety assessment of such building and to notify the fire authority of such assessment.  In such instances, the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; over a building may engage professional advisors to carry out these inspections and to assist with discharging their statutory duties; however, ultimate responsibility for fire safety in the building remains with the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo;. </p><p>In August 2017, my Department published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.  </p><p>Any member of the public who is concerned about fire safety in a building should contact the person having control of the building in the first instance, and their local Fire Service if the concerns remain unresolved.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p>  <p>   In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  Stronger compliance with building standards and the broader building control reform agenda are key priorities for Government.  In particular, the Government has committed to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI), which was established on a voluntary basis in 2014, on a statutory footing. </p>  <p>  At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill for this purpose, which was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The main objective of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations within the Builder community of the construction sector.  The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the CIRI Bill requires that a builder demonstrate competence in the category of building works to which the registration relates.  Competence is likely to be based on a number of factors including past experience.  While no legislation can have retrospective effect and any breach of another statute must be prosecuted under the appropriate act, the Bill ensures that applicants declare any convictions under health &amp;amp; safety and/or building control legislation in any jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The Bill will also allow for complaints against registered builders to be made on a number of grounds and provides for a range of proportionate sanctions to be imposed after investigation. </p>  <p>  Sanctions may be imposed in respect of any breach of the requirements of registration including, where a registered member of CIRI failed, in connection with the carrying out of building work for which they are registered, to meet the standards of competence required for such registration.</p>  <p>  This legislation will underpin the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.</p></reply>

To do this, we will offer more affordable long-term rental options, by leveraging the value of State land to reduce the cost of provision.</p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and a number of pilot cost rental projects are currently being progressed in Dublin, for example, at Enniskerry Road and in Lusk.  The projects are being delivered by Approved Housing Bodies, working with relevant local authorities, the Housing Agency and my Department. </p>  <p>  The pilot projects are providing very valuable learning in terms of the design and delivery of such a new rental model in Ireland.  Working with these and other key stakeholders, my Department is considering the optimal operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, taking account of broader policy considerations on affordable housing. </p>  <p>  In parallel with the advancement of the aforementioned pilot projects, discussions are ongoing with the European Investment Bank to leverage its extensive experience and knowledge, in developing and supporting cost rental and other affordable housing models, with a view to developing further cost rental projects in Ireland, at a greater scale. </p>  <p>  I expect local authorities to be pro-active in developing and bringing forward innovative concepts regarding the use of their land for the delivery of both affordable homes for purchase and rent.  Arising from the second Housing Summit with local authority Chief Executives in January, I have asked each local authority to furnish a report to me, setting out their plans for delivery of both social and affordable housing, with a particular focus on affordable home provision in the main urban centres, where the greatest challenges exist.  These reports have recently been received and are under consideration by my Department.</p></reply>

The Task Force was requested to oversee and report on a number of initial steps, and to urgently consider any potential life safety issues and appropriate responses.  The work of the Task Force involves reviewing and reappraising existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.  As it carries out its work, the Task Force is considering information and developments arising from inquiries and reviews in the UK in relation to the Grenfell Tower fire.</p><p>The Task Force held its first meeting on 12 July 2017 and has met on 10 occasions in total. Its membership consists of the National Director for Fire and Emergency Management along with a number of senior officials from the National Directorate, the Building Standards Section and the Housing and Corporate Management Divisions of my Department, as well as representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Local Government Management Agency, two Chief Fire Officers, external fire safety consultants and a SIPTU representative.</p><p>In addition to establishing the Task Force, I requested that a number of immediate initial actions be taken. Local authorities were directed to undertake a review of fire safety in multi-storey social housing buildings and to also review fire safety in medium to high rise buildings in their functional areas. The Task Force was mandated to oversee and report on these initial actions as well as reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland. </p><p>This initial work in relation to both multi-storey social housing buildings and medium to high rise buildings has been carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested.  The Fire Safety Task Force established two sub-groups to review the returns received from local authorities.  The returns indicate that multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland are generally designed, built and equipped appropriately for domestic fire risk, although a number of fire safety issues were identified and followed up.</p><p>With regard to the review of medium to high rise buildings (greater than 6 stories or 18m high), more than 800 buildings were identified through the national survey undertaken.  A number of these were identified as having external cladding which gave rise to concerns and in these cases building owners have been required by local authorities, using their powers under the Fire Services Acts, to undertake fire safety assessments in these specific buildings.  National guidance  on further actions in light of the results of these fire safety assessments, taking account of emerging information on the cladding issue from international sources, was prepared by the Task Force sub-group and a guidance note &ndash; &quot;<i>Fire safety Guidance Note 01 of 2017 Assessing Existing Cladding Systems in Buildings of More than Six Storeys, or More than 18m in Height&quot; </i>&ndash; was published by my Department in December 2017.  The guidance note was circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department&rsquo;s website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in medium to high rise building.  The assessment process in individual buildings, and remediation work where deemed necessary in a small number of buildings, is ongoing and in some cases is expected to take a number of months to complete. </p><p>The preparation of the report of the Task Force has been impacted by a number of recent severe weather events, including ex-Hurricane Ophelia and the blizzard conditions and heavy snow arising from Storm Emma, which required temporary re-prioritising of the National Directorate&rsquo;s resources.  However, the work of the Task Force has now advanced significantly and I expect to be provided with the report by the end of April 2018, which I will consider without delay.</p></reply>

The new loan will enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is targeted at first-time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home.  As with the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only.  This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.</p><p>In order to be eligible for the scheme, single applicants must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 per annum and the combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum. </p><p>The primary earner on the application must have at least two years' continuous employment (this can be self-employment) and the second applicant must have continuous employment for at least one year.  I have asked my Department to liaise with the Housing Finance Agency to ensure that there is consistent information in relation to eligibility for the loan.</p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information is available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website <i><i></i></i>.</p></reply>

The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable, including Family Income Supplement.  The policy provides for a range of income that can be disregarded in terms of housing assessment and local authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced and I expect the results of this review to be available for publication later this year.</p></reply>

The new loan will enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The scheme is targeted at those unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. As with the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only.  There are terms and conditions which apply to the scheme, including income limits and limits on the value of the dwelling being purchased.  Any person who meets the criteria and wishes to apply for a loan under the Scheme should apply to their local authority.</p>  <p>  However, in relation to the Deputy's specific query, it should be noted that, under the credit policy issued in accordance with the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018, there is a range of categories of people to whom the loan scheme is not available.  These include people who are declared bankrupt or currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings who have been involved in a previous settlement which has resulted in a loss to a financial institution. </p>  <p>  Where a person does not qualify for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, they are entitled to apply to their local authority for assessment as to whether they qualify for, and are in need of, social housing support. In such instances, they should apply to the local authority for their area for an assessment. </p>  <p>  I have also announced a package of measures in relation to developing an affordable purchase scheme and a cost rental scheme, the details of which I intend to finalise shortly.</p></reply>

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.

This allows all interested parties to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  The data from the Rent Index Report relating to Limerick City East are detailed in the following table: <table><tr><th>Local Electoral Area  </th><th>Quarters  7% </th><th>Average 2017 Q4 (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Limerick City East </td><td>3</td><td>&euro;1,039.82 </td></tr></table></p><p>In Limerick City East , the average monthly is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,054 per month and in 3 of the last 6 quarters rent inflation has been 7% or greater.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.1581.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700088#WRFF01000"><p>A range of housing options are necessary to ensure a supply of accommodation to meet different types of social housing need.  Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 are targeted to be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including 3,500 homes targeted using the Repair and Lease Scheme (RLS), and 6,500 homes using a  combination of the existing social housing leasing arrangements, and the new Enhanced Lease Scheme.  All homes delivered under leasing arrangements, including a new Enhanced Leasing Scheme, will be funded under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  </p><p>The new Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available.  There are, however, a number of key differences between the existing long term lease and the enhanced lease, the purpose of which is to facilitate larger levels of private investment in social housing while ensuring that the capital investment is off balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. </p><p>Under the existing long term lease agreement, the owner retains responsibility for the structural maintenance on the property.  However, the day to day management and maintenance of the property, e.g. leaking pipes, broken heating etc., is carried out by the local authority or AHB.  Under the enhanced lease arrangement, the owner is responsible for both structural maintenance and day to day repairs.  This is one of the fundamental differences between the enhanced lease and the existing arrangement and is one of the features of the lease that determined the CSO and EUROSTAT classification of the enhanced lease as an &ldquo;operating&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;finance&rdquo; lease, and therefore off-balance sheet. </p><p>The owner will be paid up to 95% of the market rate - as opposed to 80% (85% for apartments) under the existing lease agreements.  This reflects the reduced responsibility of the local authority in relation to maintenance of the property under this type of contract as compared to standard long term leasing.  The local authority will retain the differential rent paid by the tenant. </p><p>The market rent must be evidenced by a valuation prepared by a qualified valuer and each valuation must refer to 3 comparable properties in the locality as evidence of the market rent for the property.  Rent reviews will be carried out every 3 years, linked to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The term of the enhanced lease is 25 years, rather than the 10-20 year term under the existing agreements.</p><p>Local authorities will determine the suitability of the proposed properties, having regard to the standard of the properties, the requirement for social housing in the area and the criteria set out in each authority&rsquo;s Development Plans, including, in particular, sustainable communities considerations. </p><p>The scheme will be governed by my Department and operated by local authorities.  It will be funded through my Department's SHCEP.  The Housing Agency will manage and administer the scheme on behalf of my Department and will act as a national co-ordinator. </p><p>A call for proposals is currently open and the Housing Agency is accepting submissions from interested parties until 12 April 2018.  All proposals are subject to a range of criteria as set out in the &ldquo;Calls for Proposals for Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme&rdquo; and the proposals will be assessed and marked in accordance with the terms set out therein.  The Call for Proposals is available on the Housing Agency website at the following link:  <i>.</i></p><p>Further information with respect to the numbers and locations of the units proposed for leasing under the Scheme will only be available once the individual proposals have been assessed, marked and accepted in accordance with the terms and methodology set out in the Calls for Proposals document.</p></reply>

The level of contribution and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  In this context, my Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, on the implementation of development contribution schemes to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions.  </p>  <p>  This guidance updated and supplemented non-statutory guidance previously issued to local authorities by my Department by way of Circulars PD 4/2003 and PD 5/2007.  Both of these Circulars recommended the waiving of development contributions by local authorities in respect of the provision of social housing generally - including the provision of social housing by voluntary and cooperative bodies approved under Section 6 of the Housing Act 1992.  This has been the effective policy in this regard as advocated by my Department since 2003.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;200 million was originally provided under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million is funded by the Exchequer and local authorities fund &euro;50 million. Further funding was made available as part of Budget 2018, bringing the total fund to &euro;266 million and there will be a second call for proposals in order to allocate the additional funds.</p>  <p>  The total cost of the 34 projects which received preliminary approval under LIHAF in March 2017 was &euro;226 million.  When approving proposals, it was considered prudent to approve in excess of &euro;200 million available at the time to allow for instances where a proposal does not proceed due to planning issues or unforeseen delays or where potential savings are secured through tendering or other efficiencies.</p>  <p>  As required under the scheme criteria and conditions, a key focus has been to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure, as demonstrated by either provision of housing at scale at certain prices, a proportionate reduction in house prices across all of the homes being facilitated or a specified number of homes which will benefit from a larger price reduction.  </p>  <p>  To date, I have given final approval for 30 of the 34 original projects under LIHAF, which will activate supply of almost 20,000 housing units on previously inactive sites, and grant agreements in respect of those projects have been signed.  The cost of these projects is &euro;195.7 million, of which &euro;146.7 million will be funded by my Department and &euro;49 million will be funded by local authorities.  The remaining four projects are being moved for consideration under LIHAF 2 later in 2018.  Summary information on the approved projects will be published shortly, including details of the scale of reduced-price homes being facilitated on these sites as part of the dividend for the funding.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.67 million was drawn down in respect of LIHAF projects in 2017, which was mainly in respect of design costs.  It is expected that this will increase substantially in 2018 as projects move to the construction stage.  Funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall housing budget and will be available for local authorities to drawdown over the lifetime of the projects involved.  Through proactive management of the broader housing programme, the LIHAF underspend in 2017 was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available in 2017 was fully applied to housing priorities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-03-27a.1611.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018032700088#WRFF04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 660 and 661 together.</p>  <p>  In line with general practice for peat extraction, a rolling series of survey work, investigation and excavations have been carried out at Mayne Bog over a number of years.  In 2006, with the co-operation of the landowners, my Department commissioned a full survey of the then known togher (constructed of planks) followed by the excavation of a single cutting across the togher.   During the course of this excavation, a second togher (of brushwood construction) was identified slightly to the north of the plank togher and running parallel to it.  This was also surveyed and recorded. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the landowners commissioned an environmental impact statement in connection with a peat extraction licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency.  As part of the assessment process, the peatlands were fully examined by a qualified archaeological consultant and, aside from the plank togher, no further finds or features of archaeological significance were identified at that time. </p>  <p>  In 2014, at my Department&rsquo;s request, another inspection was commissioned by the landowners to assess the status of both toghers.  During 2015, and also at the request of my Department, the landowners commissioned a series of excavations which were carried out at three separate locations on both toghers.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, with the permission of the landowners, my Department commissioned an Induced Polarisation Survey (an advanced geophysical technique) to examine an area of high bog to the east of the open industrial bog at Mayne.  This methodology was previously used successfully at Edercloon, County Longford, to identify wooden structures outside the road corridor where other parts of the structures were under excavation by the National Roads Authority.   Due to the heavily waterlogged nature of the high bog at Mayne, the geophysical survey was inconclusive in tracking the togher into the higher peatlands.  During 2017, my Department commissioned a further survey using metal probes inserted through the peat, as developed and employed successfully in research at C&eacute;ide Fields in North Mayo.   The survey successfully identified that the togher continues to the east from the edge of the high bog for a minimum distance of 200 metres at depths from the surface varying from 1 to 2.4 metres. </p>  <p>  All the information referred to will assist in the protection and preservation of these toghers.  In that context, my Department is continuing to engage with all stakeholders, including the local authority and the landowners, to progress the preservation of the togher in the high bog. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the measures being taken with regard to the protection of the toghers uncovered at Mayne represent the best approach to securing an optimal outcome.  Unlike cases involving delivery of key infrastructure which are supported by the Codes of Practice agreed and in place between my Department and the various State utility providers, archeological discoveries arising from private development have to be dealt with on a case by case basis.  In such instances, the practice is to seek the co-operation of private landowners with the protection and recording of monuments in line, for example, with my Department&rsquo;s engagement with farmers under GLAS, the current agri-environmental scheme.  Such engagement is undertaken in a collaborative and transparent manner and I am satisfied that it is proving to be the best mechanism for guaranteeing the preservation of these monuments into the future.</p></reply>
