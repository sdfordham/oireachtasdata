In the course of their deliberations, the Working Groups have taken into consideration the inputs received from a wide variety of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Discussions have also been held with a range of other Government Departments on cross-cutting policy issues and likely future demands from Government bodies and State agencies.  This includes the views of international organisations which have been sought, with a particular focus on likely future trends in international peace support operations.</p>  <p>  I hosted a symposium on the White Paper at Farmleigh House on 15 May.  The Symposium provided a wide stakeholder group with an opportunity to discuss differing policy emphases as part of the concluding phase of the preparation of a new White Paper on Defence.  </p>  <p>  I anticipate that the final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval by the end of July.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-09a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015060900071#WRA01300"><p>I am advised that the Defence Forces ambulance fleet consists of both on-road and 4x4 off-road capable vehicles.  Following a tender competition, a contract was awarded in April 2012 to Wilker Auto Conversions in Clara, County Offaly for an initial two 4x4 off-road Iveco ambulances.  This was followed by a further order for four Iveco ambulances in 2013.  The tender competition was carried out in accordance with standard procurement procedures and no procurement issues arose during the course of the competition.  </p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the tasking, purpose and utilisation of the 4x4 Iveco off-road ambulances differs from the normal road ambulance.  Due to the nature of its requirement to be off-road capable, the chassis differs significantly from that of on-road ambulance vehicles.  The Iveco vehicles have a high body necessary for off-road manoeuvrability and as a result, a minimum of four persons are needed to load and unload the stretcher when operating off-road in difficult terrain.  I am advised that this would be standard practice for all military off-road ambulances which are not fitted with mechanical lifting assistance. </p>  <p>  An issue arose with the Iveco ambulance when it was used, from time to time, in normal on-road scenarios and with the normal medical crew of two people.  The crew of two people had difficulty lifting the stretcher into the ambulance.  As a result of a follow-on assessment by the Defence Forces Safety Advisor in April 2015 it was affirmed by the military authorities that the minimum lift requirements in an on-road scenario should also be four people as it would be in an off-road scenario.  Standard operating procedures and training is being provided on the safe use of the ambulance in an on-road scenario. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the focus in recent months has been to develop a cost effective solution to permit the ambulance to be used with a normal medical crew of two people.  Work is ongoing on this solution at present. </p>  <p>  I am assured by the military authorities that ambulances will be capable of safe operation both on-road and off-road.</p></reply>

The pilot focused on the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, such as Acute Coronary Care and Stroke.    </p>  <p>  In 2014, a Working Group, chaired by the Department of Health and also comprising representatives from my Department, the HSE and the Department of Health and Social Services, Northern Ireland, was established to examine options for the establishment of a permanent EAS service into the future. </p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group has been submitted to the Minister for Health.  Ultimately a Government decision will be required to provide for the permanent establishment of a service, including funding arrangements, but in the meantime my Department has agreed to extend the Air Corps' role in the pilot service while the report is being considered.</p></reply>

Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations.  Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved by close co-operation with the Italian Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and other relevant Italian authorities.  </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Eithne is deployed on the high seas in international waters between Sicily and Libya, which is where most migrant activity and search and rescue incidents have occurred.  The Irish naval vessel is working in co-ordination with European navies, including British, Italian and German naval forces.  To date, L.&Eacute;. Eithne has been involved in a number of rescue operations resulting in the rescue of approximately 1160 migrants.  </p>  <p>  The despatch of an Irish naval vessel to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation highlights the Government's commitment to assist with efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.  </p>  <p>  Regarding EU military operations in the Mediterranean, a t the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18 May, a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EU NAVFOR M ED, was adopted as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing the migration crisis in the South Central Mediterranean.  Operational planning for this naval operation is currently underway and it is anticipated that the launch of the operation may   be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council later this month. </p>  <p>  Consideration of participation by the Irish Defence Forces in EU NAVFOR M ED will only occur if there is a UN Security Council Resolution and the applicable National statutory requirements are met.  I understand that discussions on a draft Security Council Resolution are ongoing.  The Deputy will appreciate that any further comment would be premature at this point, pending the outcome of th is process.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime Ireland, through its deployment of the L&Eacute; EITHNE, will continue to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts, to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

Eithne has been involved in a number of rescue operations resulting in the rescue of approximately 1160 migrants.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean remains of great concern to Ireland, and to its EU and Southern partners.  On 20 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality attended a joint meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs Councils in Luxembourg.  At that meeting the Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner presented a 10 point plan of immediate action to be taken in response to the crisis situation in the Mediterranean.  The key focus of the plan is on preventing loss of life.  </p>  <p>  On 23 April the Taoiseach attended a special meeting of the European Council at which the 10-point action plan was considered.  A comprehensive range of commitments were agreed, including at least tripling financial resources for Operations Triton and Poseidon, thereby enabling an increase in the search and rescue possibilities within the mandate of FRONTEX.  EU leaders also committed to actions to prevent illegal migration flows, to reinforce internal EU solidarity and responsibility in relation to the processing of asylum applications and relocation of migrants, and to combat traffickers in accordance with international law.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, I attended the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council with Ministers of Defence in Brussels on 18 May, at which a Council Decision to establish a European Union military operation, EUNAVFOR MED, was adopted as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing the migration crisis in the South Central Mediterranean.  Operational planning for this naval operation is currently underway and it is anticipated that the launch of the operation may be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council later this month. </p>  <p>  Consideration of participation by the Irish Defence Forces in EU NAVFOR Med will only occur if there is a UN Security Council Resolution and the applicable National statutory requirements are met.  I understand that discussions on a draft Security Council Resolution are ongoing. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to participate actively in discussions on the various strands of the EU's comprehensive strategy.  In the meantime, through the deployment of the L.&Eacute;. EITHNE, our focus will remain on continuing to assist the Italian authorities in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea.</p></reply>

The approach of utilising open policy debates as a means to inform policy formulation is a key strategy within the Government's Civil Service Renewal Plan.</p>  <p>  The audience comprised top level civil and military staff of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, representatives from across Irish State Departments, representatives from Irish and international think tanks and academic institutions, international organisations including EU, UN, NATO, Civil Defence, the Representative and official veterans Associations of the Defence Forces and other interested parties.  </p>  <p>  The format consisted of panels of experts who gave their opinions on a number of topics throughout the day.  The Symposium was structured to generate an interactive debate with the audience.  Each panellist was given the opportunity to discuss the merits or otherwise of a particular approach.  The discussion was then opened to the wider audience for debate.  </p>  <p>  The sessions were grouped around &ldquo;policy emphases&rdquo;.  These represented key differences in &ldquo;direction of travel&rdquo; advocated by various interested parties in the course of the consultation process.  The sessions were not designed to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive.  Rather, they were intended to provide a framework within which particular courses of action could be championed and challenged.  </p>  <p>  I was very pleased with the open and positive discussion of the topics and the matters raised will be considered in the development of the White Paper.  </p>  <p>  I intend to bring a final draft of the White Paper to Government by the end of July.  Subject to Government approval, the White Paper on Defence will then be published.</p></reply>

Prior to their deployment, I met with the team in Collins Barracks, Cork.</p>  <p>  Irish personnel are part of a UK-led Joint Inter-Agency Task Force tackling Ebola in West Africa.  The Irish contingent rotated last month and five (5) medical personnel returned to Ireland on Friday 22 May 2015 after completing their four (4) month tour of duty. </p>  <p>  The replacement contingent has been reduced to four (4) Irish personnel, due to the success of the operation in tackling the Ebola virus.  Irish personnel are not engaged in direct treatment of Ebola victims but continue to provide a supporting role to front line workers who are so engaged. </p>  <p>  It is Defence Forces' policy to conduct after action reviews with all contingents returning from overseas missions.  With regard to the deployment of the Central Medical Unit Detachment to Sierra Leone, active contact was maintained throughout their service in Sierra Leone.  The information gleaned in operating in such a hazardous environment has been captured by the Defence Forces for future use.  The lessons learned were utilised to develop the medical protocols necessary to train Naval Service personnel for the current humanitarian deployment in the Mediterranean.  The returning medical personnel will be deployed to roles within the Defence Forces Central Medical Unit and are available to support the HSE with the skills they have acquired should a requirement ever be necessary.</p></reply>

These changes were the most wide ranging and fundamental to have occurred since the establishment of the Society in 1939.  Arising from these changes, the current legislation provides that Government may nominate up to 10% of the membership of the Society's General Assembly.  On 20 May last I received Government approval for the nomination of Ms. Mary Flaherty and Mr. Darren Ryan to the Society's General Assembly for a three year term.  The maximum number of Government nominees is three and I anticipate that a third appointment will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  A further consequence of the legislative changes made in 2012 is that the Society itself now has responsibility for the appointment of its Chairperson.  In this regard, I understand that at its General Assembly meeting on 23 May last, the Society elected Mr. Pat Carey to this position.  I would like to take this opportunity to wish Pat well in his new role.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in accordance with a Programme for Government commitment, my Department is continuing to progress a legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Irish Red Cross.  In this regard, it is proposed that the existing primary legislation which dates back to 1938 is to be repealed in new primary legislation that will re-define the relationship between Government and the Irish Red Cross Society.  This will further underpin the independence of the Society.  Draft Heads of the Red Cross Bill are currently being finalised and will be brought to Government for approval shortly.</p></reply>

Our ability to protect the health and safety of Irish troops deployed on the Golan Heights is of paramount concern. </p>  <p>  The current Irish contingent, the 48th Infantry Group, who deployed in March 2015, undertake regular drills and exercises to ensure that all personnel are aware of the force protection actions to be carried out in the event of a deterioration of the security situation.  Defence Forces personnel serving overseas are appropriately trained and equipped with the most modern and effective equipment to carry out their mission. </p>  <p>  The security situation in the UNDOF Area of Responsibility remains volatile and unpredictable.  Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in the mission area and personal equipment and force assets are continually reviewed, to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their role.   </p>  <p>  Following the significant events in August 2014 in the area of separation, there was a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimizing unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission's mandate.  Most UNDOF personnel are now deployed on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  A number of enhancement measures were undertaken at Camp Ziouani since the relocation of the Irish Contingent in September 2014. </p>  <p>  The reality is that no peacekeeping mission is without danger.

It kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It is a grave threat to any military force operating in that area.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of recent media articles in relation to the Freedom of Information request, released by the British Ministry of Defence to which the Deputy refers.  While I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter, the issues relating to the use of Lariam are well documented.  With regard to the issue in the U.K. Defence Forces to which you refer, the Irish Military Authorities advise me that it is a matter for individual Defence Forces to determine whichever malaria chemoprophylaxis it deems most suitable for use.  Individual Defence Forces may have regard to the operational commitments and the medical and ancillary support available to its personnel on the ground whilst also taking account of the particular licensing regulations in respect of the drug, pertaining to their jurisdiction.  It would be inappropriate for the Irish Defence Forces to comment on other Nations policy in this regard.   </p>  <p>  As you will be aware, the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA) formerly the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority with responsibility for quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland.  The Defence Forces policy in regard to the prescribing of Lariam is in line with current HPRA guidelines. </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications.  Significant precautions are taken by the Medical Corps in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors.  These include the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues.  The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Former Ministers for Defence have had the various concerns surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Lariam must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have the most effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

This includes patients, carers, other members of the public and healthcare professionals.  I can confirm that individual Defence Forces Medical Officers have reported adverse reactions to the HPRA in accordance with standard practice.  I understand, based on the latest information that there were three members of the Defence Forces with serious symptomatology which may have been caused or contributed to by Lariam although there is nothing conclusive in this regard.  I am advised by the military authorities that all three of them have made a full recovery and that their cases were reported to the HPRA.  Again there is no conclusive evidence that the use of Lariam was a factor in any of these cases.   </p>  <p>  The HPRA has informed me that to date it has received a total of one hundred and thirteen adverse drug reaction reports relating to the use of Lariam.  Of those, I am advised that thirty six reports appear to be associated with current or ex-members of the Defence Forces.  However the HPRA advises that these figures are open to an element of duplication due to incomplete material and the manner in which reports are made. </p>  <p>  Given that reports can be made directly to the HPRA by individual members of the Defence Forces or health care professionals, I am not aware as to whether any under reporting of suspected adverse effects of Lariam by the Defence Forces members occurs.  It should also be noted that the occurrence of an adverse reaction may not always be attributable to a particular medication and may be attributable to other causes. </p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis. </p>  <p>  Former Ministers for Defence have had the various concerns surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces.    </p>  <p>  Lariam must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have the most effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

The classification of a death as suicide is based on a Coroner's report and, where necessary, a report from the Garda that attended the scene.  All deaths, whether natural or unnatural must be registered with the General Registration Office (GRO).</p><p>The average annual number of deaths over the five year period from 2007 to 2011 was approximately 28,000.  In many cases the cause of death is known, i.e. the deceased was under the care of a doctor etc.  In these cases the doctor can fill out the Medical Certificate of the Cause of Death<b></b>in a relatively straightforward manner as the cause was generally an illness or sickness the deceased suffered.</p><p>However in approximately 20% of all cases (5,000 to 6,000 cases annually) the cause of death is not immediately known and the case is referred to a Coroner.  Deaths from sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths must be reported and investigated by the Coroner.  The Coroner is an independent office holder with responsibility under the law for the medico-legal investigation into these types of deaths. </p><p>The Coroner's investigation may require a post-mortem examination, sometimes followed by an inquest.  The Coroner's inquiry will establish whether death was due to natural or unnatural causes.  If death is due to unnatural causes then an inquest must be held by law.  Approximately 30% of all cases referred to the Coroner undergo a post-mortem examination and/or and inquest (some 1,500 to 1,800 cases each year).  The death will be registered by means of a Coroner's Certificate when the inquest is concluded (or adjourned in some cases).</p><p>A Form 104 is issued to the Garda&iacute; in respect of most inquest cases.  This form is sent to the Divisional Inspector of the relevant location where the death occurred and is then redirected to the Garda that attended the scene of the death.  The Form 104 collects additional information on the circumstances\location of the death and the information returned on this form is strictly confidential. </p><p>The Garda completing the Form 104 provides his/her opinion as to whether the death was an accident, homicide, suicide or undetermined and then that is taken into consideration by the mortality coder in the CSO.  If there is no mention of suicide on the Coroner's certificate and the Garda states that in his\her opinion the death was as a result of intentional self-harm, the cause of death code is attributed to suicide by the mortality coder in the CSO.  Conversely, if the Coroner's certificate states that death was by suicide and he\she provides enough information to attribute an accurate cause of death code then it is not necessary to issue a Form 104 to Garda&iacute;.  </p><p>The mortality coder in the CSO uses the information from both the Form 104 and the Coroner's certificate to assign the detailed external cause code that described the type and nature of the accident, homicide, suicide or undetermined death.  In cases where a completed Form 104 is not returned, the cause of death is coded based solely on the Coroner's certificate.</p><p>The CSO codes the exact cause of death using World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases and related health problems 10<sup>th</sup>edition (ICD-10).  All death records are given an ICD-10 cause of death code and the code is assigned in accordance with the medical evidence of cause of death detailed on the Medical Certificate of the Cause of Death or the Coroner's Certificate.</p><p>If there is any doubt about the accuracy of a cause of death code it is flagged for manual intervention by a mortality coder in the CSO who will visually inspect the details.  All inquest cases (which always include any possible suicides) are always flagged and selected for manual intervention for coding by a mortality coder.</p><p>There are also a series of edits included in the data capture system that will highlight certain cause of death codes for further checking and correction where necessary.  Where hanging is mentioned on the certificate, the mortality coder always attributes an external cause of death i.e. suicide and intentional self-harm to the record.</p><p>The CSO does not collect statistics from the Prison Service or the Central Mental Hospital but collects data from the GRO and the Garda.</p><p>The National Suicide Research Foundation carried out a study on inquested deaths in Ireland in 2007.  The recommendations of this report were reviewed and, with the exception of the review of the form 104, were outside the remit of the CSO.  The form 104 was reviewed by the CSO and found fit for purpose.  The CSO, in collaboration with the National Suicide Research Foundation, established the CSO Liaison group on Suicide Mortality Statistics in 2015.  The remit of this group is to review processes and documentation relating to suicide statistics but no recommendations have been made yet.</p></reply>

There have been three annual plenary meetings of this Group since 2012 in addition to sectoral bilateral meetings.  The next plenary meeting is due to take place in September. </p>  <p>  These meetings provide a platform to continuously assess progress, map out future work programmes, and look ahead to the next Annual British-Irish Summit. </p>  <p>  The Prime Minister and I remain committed to meeting at these annual summits to review and oversee progress in the joint work.  Three such annual reviews have taken place to date and the next Summit will take place in London on 18 June.</p>  <p>  One of the key outputs from the Joint Statement was the publication in July 2013 of the Joint (British Irish) Economic Study Report which highlights areas for further joint action and has fed into the work programme of the Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries Group.</p>  <p>  There have been significant developments on progressing recommendations outlined in the Joint Economic Study. Examples include further collaboration in R&amp;D to maximise access to Horizon 2020 funding; collaboration to unblock barriers to trade in agri-food products, sharing of best practice on CAP implementation and the successful completion of a joint trade mission, including Ministerial representation from Northern Ireland, to the Singapore Air Show and Exhibition in February 2014. </p>  <p>  Through the framework of the Secretaries General/Permanent Secretaries work programme, there have been other significant achievements, including the joint visit to the war graves in Flanders to honour Irish and British soldiers who died in the First World War, and the roll out of common travel area visa arrangements in 2014. </p>  <p>  Cooperation on EU and wider international issues is a significant feature of the Joint Statement. </p>  <p>  Bilateral meetings at Secretary General/Permanent Secretary level have also taken place between the Irish and Northern Irish Administrations.  The March 2012 Joint Statement also commits the two Governments to continue to work in close co-operation on Northern Ireland issues.  There is very close and ongoing engagement between the relevant administrations in relation to these matters, as evidenced in the recent talks leading to the Stormont House Agreement.  There are ongoing official bilateral links with Northern Ireland in addition to engagement on the areas of North/South Co-operation that are progressed through the North South Ministerial Council.</p>  <p>  The review of the work of the British Irish Council will also examine the scope for better synergies between its work and that of the Secretaries General-Permanent Secretaries Group. </p></reply>

Given the importance of the American export market to the Irish economy and companies, the Government supports an ambitious TTIP agreement.  The decision to open the TTIP negotiations was taken during the 2013 Irish Presidency by the Foreign Affairs (Trade) Council under the chairmanship of Minister Bruton and he has lead responsibility for this matter.</p><p>My Department's officials discuss TTIP on a regular basis both formally and informally with their counterparts from other capitals and administrations, as well as with representatives of EU embassies and the US embassy in Dublin as a matter of course.  The subject is also of course discussed across Government Departments.  TTIP also arises in my contacts with other leaders, and is regularly discussed at the European Council.  It also featured, naturally, during my visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day when I discussed it with President Obama and US Trade Representative Froman.  <b></b></p><p>Given the potential benefits of TTIP to Irish exporters and in particular SMEs, I hope that significant progress can be made before the end of 2015 that will allow an agreement to be concluded before President Obama leaves office.  An ambitious and comprehensive agreement will benefit economies on each side of the Atlantic, promoting job creation, economic growth and investment while reaffirming the importance of our relationship with the United States.</p></reply>

The person concerned was ineligible for IP under national legislation on the grounds that the contribution conditions for the scheme were not satisfied. EU Regulations provide that insurance contributions made in any other EU Member State may be aggregated with Irish contributions in order to satisfy the contribution conditions for IP.  As the person in question does not have the required 260 paid contributions in Ireland and he stated on the application form that he had previously worked in Poland, a request was sent to the Polish social security authorities on 10 March 2015 requesting his Polish insurance record.  This information was requested again on 27 March and 04 June 2015.  To date the requested information has not been received from the Polish authorities. </p>  <p>  As well as satisfying the contribution criteria, a person must satisfy the medical conditions for the scheme.  In order to determine medical eligibility for IP a medical assessment for the person in question is in progress. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, claims processed under EU Regulations are more complex and can take longer to finalise as the department is highly dependent on receiving necessary information from other EU states.  The department will continue to endeavour to establish the entitlement of the person in question and he will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to Family Income Supplement (FIS), a claim for the family concerned was originally received and processed in March 2015.  It was refused, as the income of the family concerned at that time was in excess of the allowed threshold for the family size.  However a new application for FIS was received in May and is being processed.  The department will be in touch with the FIS claimant shortly in relation to the outcome of their new FIS claim in light of the changed circumstances.</p></reply>

However a disregard of &euro;20.00 a day also applies to the spouse/civil partner/cohabitant for a maximum of 3 days a week (maximum &euro;60.00 a week) and the balance is assessed at 60%.  It is in the nature of means tested schemes that there is no entitlement to a payment once means exceed a given amount and there is no discretion allowed as deciding officers are obliged to follow the legislation when assessing means.  </p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) is a social insurance scheme. It is paid weekly to insured persons who are out of work and is based on contributions paid by the claimant.  It is not subject to a means test.</p>  <p>  A person who does not have an entitlement to either jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance may have an entitlement to &lsquo;sign on&rsquo; for jobseeker credits.  Credited contributions can be awarded in circumstances such as unemployment or illness and their purpose is to help protect the social insurance entitlements of insured persons during periods when they may not be in a position to pay contributions.  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual does not have entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or credited contributions, they may be eligible for another contingency based payment or in-work support from my Department such as family income supplement (FIS) or the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  SWA is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p></reply>

As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.

Therefore, with increased numbers of people living longer, it is important to ensure that those qualifying for State pension (contributory) have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions), being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, I considered it more equitable to address this disparity than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.</p>  <p>  The effect of this change has been to reduce the personal rate paid to those with 30-39 contributions (i.e., 57-75% of the maximum) to &euro;207 (90% of the maximum rate), and to reduce the rate paid to those with 20-29 contributions (i.e., 38-56% of the maximum) to &euro;196 (85% of the maximum rate).  The reduced rate of &euro;196 is still higher than the maximum rate that applied in 2007. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person's spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). </p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Work has commenced on changing this to a total contributions approach, where anomalies arising with the current method would not occur.  Under the total contributions approach, the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes. </p>  <p>  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.</p></reply>

This means that, in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the working population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to older people will decrease from 5.3 to 1 at present to 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  Life expectancy in Ireland is also increasing and whilst this is very welcome development, this also has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.  </p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Group was chaired by the Department of Social Protection and included representatives from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Pensions Board.  Further engagement was also undertaken with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health and Children.  The Group, which no longer convenes on a formal basis, met on four occasions and held a 'Forum on Working and Retirement' in Croke Park in December 2012.  The purpose of this forum was to obtain views from representative bodies and stakeholders and identify the wide ranging issues linked to working and retirement prior to the development of any possible policy proposals.  Attendees included employer and employee representative groups, older people's representative groups, representatives from the pensions industry, academic commentators and representatives from the legal profession. </p>  <p>  The agenda for Group meetings included discussion on the wide range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers; enterprise issues and employment and equality law issues.  Whilst the deliberations of the group were not published in a report or single strategy, each participating Department will take the issues that emerged and the views of sectoral interests into account in their development of relevant policy proposals.  In this context and as part of a broader move towards a Total Contributions approach, the Department of Social Protection is considering potential measures to support longer working, e.g., the deferral of the State pension to allow individuals build a more complete social insurance contribution record. </p></reply>

Public servants, who were in employment before 6 April 1995 and continued to be so employed without a break in service, are insured at the modified rate of PRSI contribution, class D; new entrants recruited after 6 April 1995 pay PRSI class A.</p><p>Following on from the 6 April 1995 changes, a number of public sector employers applied the incorrect rate of PRSI in certain situations.  This resulted in an overpayment of PRSI contributions and an underpayment of pension contributions.  The Scope Section of my Department continues to work with some of the larger employers, such as the Health Service Executive and Department of Education and Skills, to resolve these issues.</p><p>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the person concerned was made permanent and formally admitted to the superannuation scheme on 1 September 2006.  The employer should have applied class D PRSI from this date but continued to apply class A.  In 2013, following a request by the employer for an insurability decision, Scope Section determined that the correct class of contribution effective from 1 September 2006 was class D, when the employee was made permanent and formally admitted to the superannuation scheme. Prior to that, the employee was correctly insured at class A.</p><p>The social welfare payments that may be covered by the class D contributions, subject to the particular qualifying conditions for each scheme being met, are carer&rsquo;s benefit, occupational injury benefit, guardian&rsquo;s payment, and the contributory widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension.</p><p>Partial capacity benefit is a social welfare scheme which allows a person to return to work (if they have reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a payment from the Department.  To qualify for partial capacity benefit a person needs to be currently in receipt of either illness benefit (for a minimum of 6 months), or<b></b>invalidity pension.  Persons paying class D contributions are not eligible for partial capacity benefit as the qualifying schemes, illness benefit or invalidity pension are not covered by class D contributions.</p></reply>

Consequently, a day on which a retained firefighter is not otherwise employed or self-employed is deemed to be a day of unemployment for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit purposes.  Retained part-time firefighters who qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit do not have to sign off for days on which they are in training or working as a firefighter.   </p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means tested payment and earnings are taken into account in determining means.  A disregard of &euro;20 a day (up to a maximum of &euro;60) applies up to a maximum of 3 days and the balance is assessed at 60%. In determining the assessable income from insurable employment, the following deductions are allowed: superannuation, additional voluntary contributions, PRSI, the pension levy and trade union subscriptions.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is not payable where the average means are equal to or in excess of the relevant family rate of payment.</p>  <p>  Part-time firefighters are subject to the conditions of being available for and seeking full-time work as are all other jobseekers.</p></reply>

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be assessed by anyone. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  </p><p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.</p><p>In February 2015, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr Alex White, T.D., formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr. </p><p>The Group was established after a review by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. The Group will engage with a variety of stakeholders including those in the public sector, commercial bodies, post office customers and other interested parties. </p><p>The Group&rsquo;s membership is drawn from the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU), An Post, the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p><p>The Terms of Reference for the Group are to:</p><p>- examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network;</p><p>- identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience;</p><p>- engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the above objectives;</p><p>- prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable. </p><p>The Group&rsquo;s work will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network. The final report of the Group will be available later this year.</p><p>An Post has a contract with the Department of Social Protection for cash payment services to welfare customers.  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  The option to be paid at the post office remains on the forms. </p><p>I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option still remains on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

As part of the contract, the CE Sponsoring organisation is given an advance payment at the project commencement (called the Initial Grant) equivalent to 8 weeks estimated wages to cover the initial wages for the Supervisor and participants (who are paid on a current week basis) and other set-up costs (insurance costs, start-up materials, training etc.).</p>  <p>  The CE project year is divided into 13 four-week pay cycles. The Sponsor can claim the actual wages paid out in each 4-week cycle at the end of that cycle. The advance payment/Initial Grant is clawed back in tranches over the last 4 cycles (15% in Cycle 10, 15% in Cycle 11, 35% in Cycle 12 and 35% in Cycle 13). The Cycle 13 payment is withheld pending the audit/final reconciliation being carried out on the project finances at the end of the 12th cycle. On completion and sign-off of the audit, a final payment is issued by the Department to cover Cycle 13, taking account of any net over/under payment up to Cycle 12. </p>  <p>  At the end of each project, the Sponsor must have a record of all financial transactions of the project presented in a coherent manner.  These records must be supported by the submission of an independent, professionally certified, audited Statement of Income and Expenditure. </p>  <p>  The requirement under the CE Procedures for an annual audit of projects reflects the fact that funding for CE comes from the Exchequer and the Department is answerable to the Government, the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee for the administration of this funding.  </p>  <p>  There is a separate legal requirement under the Companies Acts for an annual audit of the registered company, as the organisation running a CE project may have other business interests or activities outside of the CE funding. In the majority of cases the work carried out for the CE audit can be used to assist with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) audit.</p>  <p>  There is a guideline maximum audit fee of &euro;1,000 on CE, but this can be exceeded for larger CE schemes, where justified. This figure was arrived at as part of the Financial Review of Community Employment, carried out in 2012. Prior to that there were substantial variations in audit fees (ranging from &euro;20 to &euro;9,500). </p>  <p>  Overall, the Department seeks to maximise the value for money to be achieved from the CE programme, while maintaining control of the finances in its charge.</p></reply>

It established basic EU requirements for occupational pension funds and their supervision.  The EU Commission published its proposal to review the Directive in March 2014.  In making its proposals for revision of the Directive, the EU Commission highlighted an intention to &ndash;</p>  <p>  - Give greater protection to scheme members and beneficiaries;</p>  <p>  - Require IORPS to provide members with clear and relevant information about their pension entitlements;</p>  <p>  - Remove obstacles for cross-border provision of services; and</p>  <p>  - Ensure that the supervisors have the necessary tools to enable them to effectively supervise IORPS.</p>  <p>  Given its responsibility for pensions policy, between March and December 2014, the Department of Social Protection led negotiations on the proposal at EU Council Working Party level. On the 10th December 2014 the Permanent Representatives Committee agreed, on behalf of the Council, a general approach on the revised draft directive.</p>  <p>  To ensure the Irish position in these discussions at EU level was as fully informed as possible, rather than conduct public hearings, in the period from July to September 2014, the Department of Social Protection initiated an open &lsquo;IORPS Consultation and Invitation for Submissions&rsquo; regarding the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  As well as being made available to the general public on the Department&rsquo;s website www.welfare.ie, the social partners along with consumer and industry representatives were invited to submit comments and observations on Commission proposals.  Whilst submissions received covered a wide range of views, it is reasonable to say that the proposals of most interest and concern to sectoral interests reflected those which Ireland had raised at Working Party level and on which significant progress has been made. Officials from the Department of Social Protection also engaged with the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Education and Social Protection on a number of occasions during the course of IORPS II negotiations.</p>  <p>  Following accommodation of a range of amendments tabled by Ireland and other Member States, agreement on a General Approach was secured at Council in December 2014. Negotiations have now started within the European Parliament.  Once the Parliament votes for its Report on the Directive, discussions will commence between the Council, Commission and Parliament.

It includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Unemployment is measured officially by the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey.  A person is unemployed if, in the week before the survey, they were without work and available for work within the next 2 weeks. </p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  </p>  <p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit may claim means tested jobseeker's allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  </p>  <p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  </p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  </p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p>  <p>  My Department does not keep a record of self-employed persons who are disallowed a jobseeker payment specifically on the basis of failing a means test and there are currently no plans to collate this data.</p></reply>

State pension transition (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left State pension (transition) effective for just one year. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement, with the result that average pensions will be paid for longer periods than they are at present.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  In 2013, despite reforms introduced in 2012, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million, and further increases are required year-on-year to keep pace with this demographic change. </p>  <p>  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical to protect older people from poverty.  Following on from its analysis of its award figures for State pension (transition) in 2011 and 2012 in order to establish the impact of the abolition of State pension (transition), the Department noted that only approximately 12.5 % came from employment, with over 50% coming from another social welfare payment, and the remainder coming from a combination of people already retired, paying credits or self-employed.  This indicates that a significant number of people have left employment well in advance of pension age.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland.  Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age.  It is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age (and beyond if that is there choice) and in such cases they will have a higher income than they would have from their pension.  However, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measures to support them in such circumstances. </p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66, including &ndash; </p>  <p>  (a) Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66; </p>  <p>  (b) Where a jobseeker's benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year); and </p>  <p>  (c) A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker's allowance purposes in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit within the past year. </p>  <p>  Beyond the above measures, there are no plans to introduce a new payment as the demographic reasons for the change remain.  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

My Department is informing customers that their best option is to increase their hours to 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight and claim the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.</p><p>  On that basis, it is vitally important that employers nationwide can assist transitioning one-parent family payment customers to increase their hours of work to 19 hours a week in order to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment and, therefore ensuring that they are eligible for the back to work family dividend.  This will result an increase in overall income for these customers when their entitlement to one-parent family payment ends.</p><p>  The Labour Market Council has established a sub-Group that is specifically examining the issue of how employers nationwide can assist affected lone parents  increase their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for the family income supplement payment and, subsequently, for the back to work family dividend. </p><p>  With regard to lone parents in education, procedures have been agreed to ensure that all one-parent family payment recipients who are participating in training or education when their entitlement to the one-parent family payment ends will be able to complete their course with income support, subject to normal scheme conditions.  </p><p>  For one-parent family payment recipients who are currently in education and, who were scheduled to exit one-parent family payment up to and including 2 July 2015, they can remain on one-parent family payment until their course finishes and then transition to either jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's transitional payment as appropriate. In some cases progression to a new course will be considered as part of this arrangement and so customers should discuss their options with their local Intreo Centre/Social Welfare Office. </p><p>  One-parent family payment recipients who are undertaking courses that are eligible for a SUSI maintenance grant from the Department of Education and Skills can retain this grant until they complete their current course, subject to the normal Department of Education and Skills conditions for the grant.  The maintenance grant will continue to be disregarded for means on one-parent family payment. </p><p>  After 2 July 2015 the age for receipt of one-parent family payment will be 7 years and so the majority of customers will transition to the jobseeker's transitional payment when their one-parent family payment ends.  This allows lone parents who are mid-course from 2 July 2015 onwards up to 7 years to complete their course of education.  The jobseeker's transitional payment has always allowed customers to study full-time and receive a SUSI grant.  The maintenance grant will be disregarded when calculating means for these recipients.  </p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs. </p><p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  </p><p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment. Payments under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme will be based on the local authority differential rent means test under which the full-time employment restriction does not apply and therefore will remove a key barrier to persons on social welfare in getting back to work. Housing Assistance Payment is currently in operation in eight local authority areas in which there are approximately over 2,000 Housing Assistance Payment tenancies already in place. There is a target to achieve 8,400 Housing Assistance Payment cases in 2015 as set out in the 'Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform'. </p><p>  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and housing authorities to ensure the success of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-09a.375.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015060900078#WRH01900"><p>State pensions account for the single largest block of social welfare expenditure.  This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting older people from poverty. </p>  <p>  With increases in life expectancy, more people are thankfully living to pension age and living longer in retirement, with the result that average pensions will be paid for longer periods than they are at present.  In addition, the number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This combination has obvious and significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision with substantial year-on-year increases being required.  Accordingly, to make the State pension system sustainable in the context of these considerable demographic changes and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of reforms to State pensions have been introduced as follows &ndash;</p>  <p>  - The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  - With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.</p>  <p>  - As provided for in Budget 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced from September 2012.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  - As provided for in Budget 2012, the period for which a claim for State pension can be backdated is six months.  This change came into effect in April 2012.</p>  <p>  - From December 2013, the number of paid contributions required for Widow's/Widower's/Surviving Civil Partner's pension increased from 156 contributions to 260 contributions. </p>  <p>  In line with the abolition of State pension (transition) all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  In this context, the main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a jobseeker's benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the jobseeker's entitlement relating to the second benefit year.  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of jobseekers benefit within the past year.</p></reply>

The purpose of these reforms is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by providing lone parents with the necessary education, training and employment supports to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.</p>  <p>  The reforms have been ongoing since 2013 and the final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015 when the youngest child for receipt of OFP will reduce to 7 years of age for all customers.  </p>  <p>  For customers who are working less than 19 hours per week and who are affected by the OFP scheme age change reforms, the most financially advantageous option that is available is to increase their working hours to a minimum of 19 per week, or to 38 per fortnight, and to subsequently apply for the family income supplement (FIS).  The additional hours worked can come from one employer or from a combination of employers.    </p>  <p>  FIS recipients can also claim the recently introduced back to work family dividend (BTWFD).  This income support allows these customers to retain the increase for qualified child (IQC) portion of their former OFP payment, which equals &euro;29.80 per week per child (up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 per week for four children), for two years, with full IQC entitlement (worth &euro;1,550) in the first year and 50% entitlement (worth &euro;775) in the second year.</p>  <p>  While it is not possible to anticipate the numbers of transitioning OFP recipients who will be unable to increase their working hours to avail of the FIS supplement, there has been a significant increase in new FIS applications from lone parents since the OFP scheme age change reforms commenced in July, 2013.  This indicates that many transitioning lone parents who are working less than 19 hours are increasing their hours of employment in order to become new FIS customers.</p>  <p>  Customers who cannot increase their working hours in order to claim the FIS supplement have access to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment until their youngest child reaches the age of 14 years.  This arrangement allows these customers to work part-time without restriction and to simultaneously receive an income support payment, subject to a means test.  If their youngest child is aged 14 years or over, they may still qualify for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA).   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Labour Market Council has established a sub-group that will specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist transitioning OFP customers with increasing their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for FIS and, subsequently, the BTWFD.

These initiatives build on the existing supports that are provided for, and implemented by, the D/CYA in the child care sector, through which child care is provided to some 25,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates. </p><p>  The D/CYA has established a group at senior level to carry out an economic and cost-benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility, and affordability of quality child care, including early years (i.e. early childhood care and education for children aged 0 to 6 years) and after-school (i.e for school-going children) child care.  The group is led by the D/CYA and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Education and skills, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation and my Department.  It is intended that it will finalise its work in the summer of 2015.</p></reply>

In general, they work in teams and are dedicated to working and supporting clients to help them regain employment.  This number is supplemented by a further 160 mediators who are employed by Local Development Companies as part of the Local Employment Service which the Department contracts on an annual basis.  </p>  <p>  The number of case officers assigned by the Department to any given area is kept under review in the context of demand for services locally.  Resources are allocated in areas of greatest need and are reviewed regularly to reflect local pressures.  Therefore, the number of vacancies fluctuates on a weekly/monthly basis - and also by region - as resources are rebalanced to particular offices/centres to reflect emerging work and client demands.  The national figure of 42 vacancies is, therefore, a snap-shot at a particular point in time and subject to change on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  Overall, staffing needs within the Department are subject to on-going review.  This is to ensure that, firstly, the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing as efficient a service as possible to those who rely on schemes operated by the Department and that, secondly, the services are reconstituted, where that proves necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society. </p>  <p>  The majority of case officers employed by the Department are at the Higher Executive Officer (HEO) level.  The figure used by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the cost of a while-time HEO (including pensions, PRSI and overheads) is currently &euro;74,447.  </p></reply>

The rate of consistent poverty for children in 2013 was 11.7 per cent, based on official statistics from the Central Statistics Office. This compares with an average of 8.7 per cent for the years preceding the crisis (2005-2008). </p><p>Using the at-risk-of-poverty measure, 17.9 per cent of children were in poverty in 2013, which is less than the average figure of 20.8 per cent in the years preceding the crisis. Using this indicator, Ireland is ranked 9<sup>th</sup>best of the 28 EU member states, well below the average. Furthermore, through social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced by 60 per cent. Ireland is the third best performing of the 28 EU member states in this regard.</p><p>The Government has already adopted a key recommendation of the UNICEF report - to make an explicit commitment to end child poverty - by setting a child poverty target in April 2014, which is to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020. Under Better Outcomes, Better Futures, the Government is implementing a multi-dimensional approach to child poverty. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection helps to prevent child poverty by providing a comprehensive range of income supports for families, amounting to &euro;3 billion in 2014. In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children, including an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit. </p><p>In order to break the cycle of child poverty, the Government is investing in prevention and early intervention services targeted at disadvantaged children through the Area Based Childhood programme and the DEIS programme. </p><p>Finally, through Pathways to Work and the Action Plan on Jobs, the Government is helping families to get back into work, supported by in-work benefits such as the family income supplement and new back to work family dividend.  </p></reply>

Other cohabiting couples are, however, liable to inheritance tax where the surviving partner inherits property from the deceased partner. The relationship between the deceased person and the person who inherits the property determines the maximum life-time aggregate tax-free threshold below which inheritance tax is not charged. There are, in all, three separate relationship thresholds (set out below). The value of each of a person's inheritances since 5 December 1991 is aggregated and inheritance tax is charged, where the aggregate value exceeds the relevant threshold, on any amount that exceeds the threshold. </p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the deceased person. This threshold also applies to parents where they inherit an absolute interest in a property from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150</b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor (for example, a grandparent) or lineal descendant of the deceased person.</p><p><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075</b>applies in all other cases, for example, from uncle to niece, between in-laws and persons with no relationship to each other. </p><p>Cohabiting couples can, however, in certain circumstances be exempt from the payment of inheritance tax in respect of the inheritance of a dwelling house. The main conditions attaching to this exemption are that the person who inherits the dwelling house must have lived there for a minimum of three years prior to the inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling-house. Also, with the exception of persons who are aged 55 years or over at the date of the inheritance, he or she must continue to live in that dwelling-house, as his or her only or main residence, for a period of six years commencing on the date of the inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be liable to inheritance tax when it is the subject of an inheritance.</p><p>Given the existence of this provision I do not consider it necessary at this time to modify the tax legislation with regard to unmarried cohabiting couples.</p></reply>

I understand from my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who has responsibility for that matter that he intends to bring proposals to Government shortly regarding the public sector pension reductions made in recent years.</p>  <p>  The details supplied primarily refer to the Pension Fund Levies which I introduced in 2011 and 2014 on the assets of private pension funds.  I announced in my Budget 2014 speech that the 0.6% levy introduced in 2011 to fund the Jobs Initiative would be abolished from 31 December 2014.  I did, however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015.  I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.  I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy will expire at the end of 2015. </p>  <p>   The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. </p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State.  Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p>  <p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved by Revenue through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p>  <p>  Revenue co-operates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.</p>  <p>  Revenue's action against the illegal trade has resulted in significant seizures of illicit products, and in convictions of persons involved in the smuggling or sale of illicit products.  In 2014 53.4 million cigarettes and 9,824 kilogrammes of tobacco were seized, and seizures this year, to the end of April, amounted to 22.1 million cigarettes and 634 kilograms of tobacco.  There were 53 summary convictions and 4 convictions on indictment for tobacco smuggling, and 49 summary convictions and 5 convictions on indictment for the selling of illicit tobacco products, in 2014.</p>  <p>  A strong legislative framework is in place to combat the illegal tobacco trade.  It is an offence to hold, produce, deliver or deal in untaxed tobacco products and to sell unstamped tobacco products.  A court may impose heavy penalties for these offences and the tobacco products concerned in the offence are liable to forfeiture. On conviction following summary prosecution, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  On conviction following prosecution on indictment, the court may impose a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both a fine and imprisonment.  A higher fine may be imposed where the value of smuggled tobacco products (inclusive of any tax or duty payable on them) is greater than &euro;250,000; in such cases the court may impose a fine of an amount not exceeding three times their value. </p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of legislative measures in recent years to assist Revenue in dealing with tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco sales.  Measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excisable products.  In the Finance Act 2013, I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production.  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, I strengthened the obligation of a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination.  The measure also allows the Officer or Garda to search any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade and I will support any proposals for additional measures that are shown to be of assistance to Revenue in this area.</p></reply>

To this end, the Special Liquidators have published advertisements and have written to known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation.  Creditors in the UK and Ireland had until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US had until 31 May 2015.  </p><p>There were c. 2,700 claims made by creditors by 31 May 2015.  The adjudication of all creditor claims is ongoing.  Once the creditor adjudication process is complete, the Special Liquidators will write to each claimant to confirm whether their claim(s) have been admitted as valid claims against Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (in Special Liquidation).</p><p>The Special Liquidators are unable to comment at this stage both on the level of proceeds that will ultimately be generated from the liquidation and on the level of valid creditor claims that will ultimately be received in respect of the liquidation.  It is the balance between the proceeds generated and level of valid claims that will ultimately determine the dividend to which each creditor may be entitled. </p><p>The ultimate level of dividend paid, if any, to each creditor cannot be known until such time as all loan assets are sold, the total level of adjudicated creditors is finalised and the other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise, including those from litigation, are known.</p><p>For the payment of proceeds from the liquidation, unsecured creditors will rank in priority to the holders of subordinated debt.  The priority for the distribution of assets under the Companies Acts is generally:</p><p>- Costs and expenses of the ongoing liquidation (these claims are certain to be paid in full) ;</p><p>- Preferential creditors, including certain taxes and employee and pension claims arising prior to the date of liquidation (these claims are certain to be paid in full);</p><p>- Amounts owing to NAMA under the Facility Deed acquired from the Central Bank which were secured by a floating charge over the banks assets (these claims have been fully repaid and the floating charge has been released); </p><p>- Unsecured creditors, including: </p><p>- Debts owing to the Minister/NTMA under ELG</p><p>- Debts owing to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme</p><p>- Unguaranteed debt/depositors</p><p>- Unknown, including:</p><p>- Local authority development bonds</p><p>- Suppliers/other &quot;normal&quot; unsecured creditors</p><p>- Employees that are not preferential creditors</p><p>- Contingent creditors and other potential costs principally relating to litigation, etc. </p><p>- Subordinated creditors</p><p>- Members of the company - the Minister currently holds 100% of all shares and preference shares in the company.</p><p>The Special Liquidators hope to be in a position to make an interim dividend to those unsecured creditors whose claims have been deemed valid in Q4 2015. </p></reply>

RCT deductions are treated as a down-payment for income tax due for the period in which it is deducted or there is the option to have RCT offset against VAT or PAYE/PRSI.</p>  <p>  In this instance &euro;318 of an overall RCT credit of &euro;2,268 has been offset against an existing VAT liability that had been paid and a refund of the payment of &euro;318 will issue to the person concerned shortly.  The balance of the RCT credit of  &euro;1,948 is available for offset against any further tax liability that arises in 2015.  When the income tax liability for 2015 is determined, i.e. on the filing of the return for that year in 2016, any excess RCT for 2015 at that stage will be refunded.</p></reply>

A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits, as well as certain petroleum, mining and land-dealing activities, and chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.</p><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that published statistics regarding receipts of corporation tax are available on the Revenue website at . </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note the amounts of profits, before allowing credits and reliefs, that are taxable at the different rates of corporation tax are published under the heading &quot;Total Taxable Income&quot; at <i></i>. </p><p>The total amount of corporation tax collected in 2014 was &euro;4.617bn.  </p><p>Due to the interaction of reliefs and allowances after the calculation of gross tax at the various corporation tax rates, it is not possible to identify the amount of receipts that are in respect of profits taxable at the 12.5% rate alone.  However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the vast majority of the net receipts are from the standard rate of tax. </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have advised that it is not possible to accurately estimate the additional revenue that may be brought in from increasing the 12.5% tax rate to 15%.  This would require ex ante knowledge of any behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers as a consequence.  In terms of any increase in the 12.5% rate, the negative impact of behavioural effects on the corporation tax yield are likely to be relatively significant.</p><p>To give the Deputy an idea of what the effects of such a change could be, I would highlight that an OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland's inward investment by nearly 10%.  This OECD study assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland, given the economic challenges faced by a small island.</p><p>Last year my Department published the Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy.  This contained the results of extensive research which was carried out and commissioned by the Department of Finance in 2014 which sought to quantify the effect of corporation tax policy on the Irish economy.</p><p>As part of this project, the Economic and Social Research Institute ('ESRI') were commissioned to carry out a study into the impact that the corporation tax rate has on the decision of firms to invest in Ireland.  This independent research found that if the Irish corporation tax rate had been 15% over the period of their sample, then the number of new foreign investments into Ireland would have been 22% lower.</p><p>Another paper, titled Literature Review of the Economic impacts of Corporation Tax highlighted research by the OECD and others that point to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage economic growth.</p><p>The maintenance of the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax is therefore extremely important for Ireland's economy.  Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe.  A competitive corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting FDI to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.</p><p>This evidence underpins the Government's continued commitment to the 12.5% rate.  </p><p>These documents (and the others from the project) can be viewed on the Departments website at the following link: .</p></reply>

The NPRF now legally only exists to manage the transfer of its assets to the ISIF.  </p>  <p>  As you will be aware, the NPRF was set up with the intention to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 to at least 2055. While the need for the State to provide for social welfare and public service pensions obligations has not abated, fostering economic activity and employment is currently a greater priority and this will in turn put the State in a better position to meet its pensions obligations in the longer-term.</p>  <p>  It also must be noted that there is expected to be a significant reduction in public sector pensions following the pay and pension cuts since 2009 and the freeze in pay and pension rates until after the Haddington Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  A key result of the most recent actuarial valuation carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to update the accrued liability in respect of Public Service occupational pensions was that the total accrued liability was estimated at &euro;98bn as at December 2012.  This compares with the previous estimate of &euro;116bn for 2009 which was arrived at by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG). Therefore, over the three years from 2009 to 2012 the liability fell by &euro;18bn or by 16%. </p></reply>

Individuals who dispose of shares in order to purchase agricultural land are no different to any other taxpayers who may decide to dispose of shares or other assets.  </p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that it is only an actual chargeable gain that is subject to capital gains tax, not the entire consideration that is derived from a disposal of shares.

The measure applies where an individual, who has paid capital gains tax on the disposal of assets, makes investments in a new business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of investment.  The CGT payable on the disposal of the new chargeable business assets will be reduced by the lower of (i) the CGT paid by the individual on a previous disposal of assets in the period from 1 January 2010 and (ii) 50% of the CGT due on the disposal of the new investment. This measure was included in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013, subject to receipt of EU State Aid approval, and was subsequently put into effect in Finance Act 2014 with certain amendments to comply with EU State Aid rules and to improve the effectiveness of the relief.</p>  <p>  Due to the conditions attaching to the relief, as outlined above, no Exchequer cost arises in either 2014 or 2015. </p></reply>

The outcome of the review was the consolidation and replacement of outdated reliefs by Finance Act 2007.  The overall thrust of the measures was to ensure that any intermediary (such as brokers or counter parties) in the chain of a share dealing transaction would continue to be exempt from stamp duty where they do not hold shares as an investment for their own benefit.  The ultimate purchaser in the chain of a share dealing transaction continued to be liable for stamp duty at the prevailing rate on the consideration given for shares. This rate was 1% when the reliefs were introduced and remains at 1%. Therefore, the new measures, in themselves, would not have resulted in any change in stamp duty revenue for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's question is hypothetical in that it asks about the effect of not having introduced a tax measure that was in place for a particular year, i.e. 2014.  It cannot be assumed that, in the absence of the new measures the removal of the existing reliefs, would have yielded a certain amount of stamp duty as it may have been counterproductive and had the effect of discouraging share transactions. It would therefore be inappropriate to speculate on the matter.</p>  <p>  In relation to actual share dealing transactions, I am advised by Revenue that there were in excess of 10 million individual transactions carried out through the CREST share settlement system in 2014. Obtaining details of the cost to the Exchequer of reliefs claimed under central counter party and intermediary relief would require an extensive investigation and analysis of Revenue's records which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</p>  <p>  In any event, my view is that the usefulness of carrying out such an exercise is questionable.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Resolution Fund under the 2011 Act is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution. In particular the Resolution fund may be used for:</p><p>- the payment of financial incentives for transfers;</p><p>- providing capital for a bridge bank (details of a bridge bank are set out in Part 4 of the 2011 Act);</p><p>- meeting the expenses of the Central Bank incurred when discharging functions under the Act, and</p><p>- making certain payments under the Act, for example, the payment of expenses to an assessor appointed under the Act. </p><p>To date, the resources of the Resolution Fund have been utilised to fund the resolution of 4 credit unions. In the case of 3 of those credit unions, the resolution action taken was a directed transfer under the 2011 Act, and the Resolution Fund funded a financial incentive for the transferee. The remaining case was a liquidation, and no incentive was paid from the Resolution Fund in respect of that resolution. In each of the 4 cases, the Central Bank discharged its third party resolution related costs against the Resolution Fund.</p><p>The amounts paid or payable to date from the Resolution Fund for incentives in each of the 3 transfer resolution cases are as follows:</p><p>- Newbridge Credit Union Limited: &euro;27 million</p><p>- Howth Sutton Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>- Killorglin Credit Union Limited: &euro;2.15 million</p><p>- Central Bank resolution related expenses that have been discharged against the Resolution Fund to date amount to &euro;2.7 million.</p><p>To date &euro;35.4 million has been drawn down from the Resolution Fund by way of expenditure relating to incentives for credit union resolution, Central Bank resolution related expenses and interest expenses.</p><p>The breakdown of expenses per year of operation of the Resolution Fund is as follows:<table><tr><th>October 2011 to December 2012*</th><th>&euro;1.3 million</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;26.9 million</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;6.9 million</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (YTD)</td><td>&euro;0.3 million</td></tr></table></p><p>The Resolution Fund has income over the period amounting to &euro;29 million.

It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I do not see this as a wide-spread Initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention. However, as is the case with all tax reliefs, the scheme will be kept under review.</p></reply>

In circumstances where they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is possible that their capital position can be affected with a consequential effect on prices. In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers across the EU known as Solvency II, which will come into force from the start of 2016, will place a greater emphasis than the existing regime on the need to price risk appropriately, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy.</p>  <p>  Government initiatives such as the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety, which has reduced accidents significantly, continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level. </p>  <p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met elsewhere, thus protecting policyholders who would otherwise suffer a loss.  It is funded through a  levy which is applied to home, motor and commercial insurance  This levy, which operates under the Insurance Act 1964, came into effect from 1 January 2012 and continues to be required give the current liability on the Fund.  Under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland. Where, in the opinion of the Central Bank, the state of the ICF is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  This determination is based on a review carried out by the Central Bank annually.  The last such review was carried out in October 2014 following which the Central Bank made a determination that the levy should remain at 2%.</p></reply>

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks. </p>  <p>  I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.  There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.</p>  <p>  The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates. </p>  <p>  The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will review progress over the coming weeks and a follow up set of meeting with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget. </p>  <p>  The details supplied in relation to this question are similar to those supplied in representations made to me recently.  I have been informed that due to different market and funding dimensions in Northern Ireland, First Trust Bank's current SVR is 4.75%. (First Trust is AIB's Northern Ireland subsidiary). </p>  <p>  Introductory rates are commonly offered by banks in Northern Ireland, including First Trust Bank. These exist for a relatively short period (normally 2-3 years). Up-front loan administration and arrangement fees are a feature of markets outside the Republic of Ireland, and are often charged to customers who wish to avail of these lower introductory rates. After the expiry of the discount period, the mortgage rate typically reverts to the SVR which, at 4.75%, is higher than the current AIB SVR rate in the Republic of 3.90%. Loan administration and arrangement fees are not currently charged to mortgage customers in the Republic of Ireland.</p></reply>

The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. Should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. Where a decision is taken by the trustees of a pension scheme to pass on the impact of the pension fund levy to scheme members as outlined  then the impact on the scheme in terms of  its solvency position would be neutral.</p>  <p>  I announced in my Budget 2014 speech that the 0.6% Pension Fund Levy introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011 would be abolished from the 31st of December 2014. I did, however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I did this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative. I confirmed in my Budget 2015 speech that the additional 0.15% levy will expire at the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax was being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p>  <p>  The pension fund levy does not apply to public service pension schemes because they are unfunded. However, the pensions of public servants have been subject to a public service pension reduction (PSPR) since 1 January 2011. The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. The PSPR is not a levy but is a pension cut affecting public service pensions.  On introduction, the PSPR was estimated as reducing public service pensions by 4% on average, with more severe effects experienced at higher pension levels due to the progressive multi-band structure of the reduction.</p>  <p>  A change to the PSPR was made on 1 January 2012, when a 20% reduction rate (previously 12%) was imposed on pension amounts above &euro;100,000. With effect from 1 July 2013, more changes were made to the PSPR to deliver on the Government's commitment to further reducing those public service pensions above &euro;32,500 by between 2% and 5% in certain circumstances, including the pensions above that level of individuals who retired after end- February 2012.</p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy tax collected as suggested in the details supplied. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the  tax burden on low and middle income earners. </p></reply>

NAMA holds 49 million A ordinary shares of NAMAIL. The remaining 51 million B ordinary shares of the company are owned in equal proportion by three private companies (Walbrook Capital; New Ireland Assurance Co. plc and Percy Nominees Ltd., a nominee of Prescient Investment Managers).  Under the shareholders' agreement, the maximum return which will be paid to the private investors by way of dividend is restricted to the 10 year Irish Government Bond Yield applying at the date of the declaration of the dividend. In addition the maximum investment return to the private investors is capped under the Articles of Association of NAMAIL.</p><p>On 13 March 2014, the Board of NAMAIL declared and approved a dividend payment of  &euro;0.0302 per share (2013: &euro;0.0424 per share). The amount of the dividend per share was based on the ten year Irish government bond yield as at 31 March 2014, and amounted to &euro;1.54m (2013: &euro;2.162m). The dividend was paid to the holders of B ordinary shares of NAMAIL only. </p><p>More generally NAMA, as a whole, has reported profits after tax in each year since it was established, other than in 2010, its first full year of operation, when it incurred an impairment charge of &euro;1.5 billion.  In 2014, NAMA itself reported its fourth successive year of profit, generating profit after tax of &euro;458m (2013: &euro;213m).  </p><p>The Annual Reports and Accounts for each year since inception (2010 - 2014) are available on the NAMA website, . The latest Annual Report for 2014 was published on 27th May last. </p></reply>

Following a number of reviews to assess the costs and benefits of property-based tax inventive schemes, these reliefs were wound down on a transitional basis. </p>  <p>  The Living City Initiative, which was enacted in Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5 May 2015, was introduced following a comprehensive, independent ex ante cost benefit analysis.</p>  <p>  This Initiative is targeting particular areas of six cities which are most in need of regeneration. I do not currently intend to extend the Initiative further to towns. However, my Department will closely monitor the progress of the Initiative in the six cities, and will keep the matter of potentially extending the relief further under review.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is a targeted scheme, and is not intended as a wide-spread initiative, as it is focused at those inner city areas which are most in need of attention.</p></reply>

Up until the introduction of this Scheme individuals exporting vehicles had no way of recouping the residual VRT contained in the vehicle. An administration charge of &euro;500 was initially necessary in order to recoup the significant investment necessary in setting up the technological platforms for operating the refund scheme and the interface with the third party to which the export examinations have been outsourced.</p>  <p>  However, as I have said before, now that the necessary systems are in place and the scheme is operating effectively, I believe that there is an opportunity to reconsider the level of the charge with a view to a reduction in the context of this year's Finance Bill process. I have instructed my officials to examine the level at which the administration charge is set. Any new rate at which the administration charge may be set must continue to reflect the significant ongoing administrative and enforcement costs of the Scheme.</p></reply>

I will however, give my initial views on the most significant issue raised by the Council.  </p>  <p>  The Fiscal Council stated that the fiscal projections contained in the Stability Programme Update did not show Ireland complying with our requirements under the Stability &amp;amp; Growth Pact, ie. the improvement in our structural balance was not the required minimum.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the European Commission will judge compliance with the fiscal rules on the basis of two assessments. First is the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance and the second is compliance with the expenditure benchmark. The minimum improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark are designed to be complementary.</p>  <p>  The fact that the estimated structural improvement was less than required was explicitly addressed in the Spring Economic Statement. Indeed, based on my Department's estimates at that point in time, compliance with one assessment, the expenditure benchmark, results in not meeting the other assessment, the annual improvement in the structural balance. This somewhat counter intuitive outcome emphasises the material problems posed by some of the technical aspects the rules can generate.  </p>  <p>  While on the basis of the forecasts contained in the SES, Ireland is not projected to meet the minimum structural adjustment required under the preventive arm of the SGP, in general, Commission assessments of the fiscal stance have taken a pragmatic approach to some of these country specific aberrations and is not expected to be a substantive issue for Ireland.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the assessment of the SPU by Commission staff found that, assuming execution of the fiscal measures set out in the SPU, the outlook for 2016 is indeed compliant with the structural pillar under the Budgetary Rule. </p>  <p>  While I will address other issues comprehensively in my formal response to the Council, I would strongly make the point that when formulating Budget 2016, the Government are acutely aware of the importance of adhering to the fiscal rules and our fiscal policy will reflect this.</p></reply>

Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the assistance with fuel costs used by members of the Scheme, based on provisional figures the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;48.6 million to the Exchequer in 2014, an increase of &euro;5.1 million on the 2013 cost. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  I regularly receive correspondence from individuals with disabilities that do not meet the criteria but who believe they would benefit from the Scheme.

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. In Budget 2015 I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax.</p>  <p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out. </p>  <p>  The aim of the incentive is to stimulate increased activity in the construction sector and boost employment. It is aimed at supporting fully tax compliant builders and moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy as all expenditure and relief claims have to be registered electronically with the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query as to whether the HRI will be extended beyond 2015, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. However, as with all tax reliefs, the HRI will be considered as part of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

Specifically, banks are required to demonstrate compliance with the EBA Guidelines on Outsourcing, dated 14 December 2006, which sets out the relevant requirements for banks in respect of any outsourcing arrangements.  The Central Bank reviews a bank's outsourcing proposal against these guidelines and indicates its non-objection or otherwise, it does not formally approve these proposals.</p>  <p>  The effect of provision 2.10 of the Code is that a regulated entity must ensure that any company operating under an outsourcing arrangement from that regulated firm, acts in accordance with the rules of the Consumer Protection Code.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has previously commented in relation to IT failures specifically and stated that  Ultimate accountability for compliance remains with firms and they must ensure that they maintain oversight of outsourced activities.  Where firms and their management fail to ensure that robust governance arrangements are in place for in-house and outsourced IT systems, they should expect vigorous investigation and follow up by the Central Bank, and for the Central Bank to exercise its powers, including sanctioning powers where appropriate.</p>  <p>  All financial institutions are expected to have adequate systems and controls in place and where issues that impact customers arise they should be addressed and rectified urgently, particularly as customers are increasingly using and becoming dependent on online and mobile banking services.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Central Bank expects firms to communicate clearly and promptly with affected customers when a technical incident occurs, including details of the impacted service, details of alternative access to services and an undertaking that identifiable loss will be remediated.  The Central Bank's expectations have been communicated to banks and are provided for in the Consumer Protection Code as follows:</p>  <p>  Section 2.4 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it has and employs effectively the resources, policies and procedures, systems and control checks, including compliance checks, and staff training that are necessary for compliance with this Code.</p>  <p>  Section 10.2 also provides that a regulated entity must resolve all errors speedily and no later than six months after the date the error was first discovered, including: </p>  <p>  a) correcting any systems failures; </p>  <p>  b) ensuring effective controls are implemented to prevent any recurrence of the identified error; </p>  <p>  c) effecting a refund (with appropriate interest) to all consumers who have been affected by the error, where possible; and </p>  <p>  d) notifying all affected consumers, both current and former, in a timely manner, of any error that has impacted or may impact negatively on the cost of the service, or the value of the product, provided, where possible.</p></reply>

This system applies to the public service also.</p>  <p>  This process has served the public service well during the years of fiscal and economic crisis.  The negotiation and agreement by public service employers with staff interests of the Croke Park and Haddington Road Agreements have provided an agreed stable and effective industrial relations framework to manage a reduction of some 20% in the public service pay bill and a 10% reduction in public service staff  numbers since the end of 2009.  The Agreements have delivered increased productivity through a range of measures including the introduction of a new single pension scheme, reformed annual leave and sick leave arrangements and through the provision of additional working hours in a climate of industrial peace.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of discussions on pay and reform in the public service on 29 May last, the negotiators on both sides, with the expert assistance of the LRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals to form the basis of a new agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This will extend the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement to September 2018, while securing an Industrial Relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change at the level of the workplace.</p>  <p>  The proposals which provide for the beginning of the gradual unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation, which was put in place in response to the financial crisis, are prudent and sustainable in the fiscal space currently available to Government.</p>  <p>  Future pay determination in the public service will continue for some time to be dominated by the legislative constraints imposed on public service employers under the FEMPI legislation.  Alternative pay determination structures which can provide a sustainable public service pay policy into the future and can apply when the FEMPI legislation is brought to an end will have to be considered by Government in due course.</p></reply>

The legislation was amended from 1 January 2012 to increase the top rate of PSPR from 12% to 20% on the portion of any public service pension amount in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 also provided for additional Public Service Pension Reduction rates ranging from 2% to 8% to be applied to all annual public service pensions in payment in excess of &euro;32,500 from 1 July 2013.  Full-year savings from these pension measures is currently in excess of &euro;125 million.</p>  <p>  There were no discussions with the public service unions regarding the application of the PSPR.  However, in relation to the impact of PSPR on the income of public service pensioners I met with representatives of retired public service pensioners in May 2013 and indicated at that time that it was my intention as a matter of priority to move towards reducing the burden of public service pension reductions, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  I also met with the representatives of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants in March last and further meetings have been held between the Association and my officials regarding issues raised in a detailed presentation and submission made by the Alliance in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  Following the recently announced proposals formulated by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the Lansdowne Road Agreement I indicated it is my intention to begin the orderly restoration of public service pension reductions made in recent years.  In line with my stated commitments I will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly for approval providing for a reduction in the impact of the PSPR on public service pensions.</p></reply>

This will extend the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement to September 2018, while securing an Industrial Relations framework that will foster and support further productivity and change at the level of the workplace.  The proposals provide for the gradual unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation, which was put in place in response to the financial crisis.  The Government is satisfied that they are in keeping with the commitment to give priority, in any unwinding of FEMPI measures, to those public servants on lower pay rates.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will extend the existing Public Service Stability Agreement from 2016 to 2018.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">  These proposals, which will partially unwind the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants, are prudent and sustainable in the fiscal space currently available to Government.</font><font color="#181818">The estimated overall gross cost of these pay measures (inclusive of the previously committed costs attributable to the Haddington Road Agreement) in each year of the Agreement is &euro;267m in 2016, &euro;290m in 2017, and &euro;287m in 2018 or a cumulative &euro;844m by 2018 of which &euro;278m is attributable to the pre-existing Haddington Road Agreement commitments.  This should be compared to public service pay bill savings of &euro;2.1bn annually, achieved as a direct result of pay reductions under the FEMPI legislation.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">With regard to the net cost of the pay measures, each employee's tax, PRSI and USC treatment is an individual matter while the mix of pay increases and a reduction in the Pension Related Deduction which are provided for within the proposals attract different treatment under the tax code.  However, as a rule of thumb, fiscal deductions to increases in gross pay to employees generally are estimated to amount to about a third of any gross pay award.  When the deductions that are specific to public servants are included, the average is likely to be in the region of 50%.</font></p><p><font color="#181818">Negotiations in relation to the Lansdowne Road Agreement proposals were undertaken between representatives of the Government and the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.  The declared position of the Committee was, in entering those discussions, to enter a single collective agreement with the Government.  A similar parallel process was conducted with the Representative associations of the Garda and Defence Forces.

The PRD applies on a progressive basis to the annualised remuneration of public servants currently employed.  It does not apply to retired public servants.  The recently announced proposals formulated by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the Lansdowne Road Agreement provide inter alia for a two-step increase in the exemption threshold from &euro;15,000 per annum to &euro;28,750 in 2016 which will give an annualised reduction in PRD liability to each public servant of up to &euro;1,000 per annum. </p><p>The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), commencing 1 January 2011, applies to retired public servants and imposed reductions on annual public service pensions in payment in excess of &euro;12,000, using a progressively tiered set of bands and rates.  In relation to the impact of PSPR on the income of public service pensioners I met with representatives of retired public service pensioners in May 2013 and indicated at that time that it was my intention as a matter of priority to move towards reducing the burden of public service pension reductions, with the initial focus on the people in receipt of low pensions, at the earliest date economic progress permits.  I also met with the representatives of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants in March last and further meetings have been held between the Association and my officials regarding issues raised in a detailed presentation and submission made by the Alliance in recent weeks. </p><p>Following the recently announced proposals formulated by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the Lansdowne Road Agreement  on 29 May last, I indicated it is my intention to begin the orderly restoration of public service pension reductions made in recent years.  In line with my stated commitments I will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly for approval providing for a reduction in the impact of the PSPR on public service pensions.</p></reply>

This is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  The CFRAM Programme, which is focused on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (or &ldquo;AFAs&rdquo;) countrywide, is the principal vehicle for implementing national policy on flood risk management and the European Directive on the Assessment and Management of Flood Risk (2007/EC/60).  Further information is available on the Programme website . </p><p>  In brief, the CFRAM Programme has three principal milestones:</p><p>- Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (Completed 2011)</p><p>- Predictive Flood Mapping (for finalisation 2015)</p><p>- Flood Risk Management Plans (for finalisation 2016)</p><p>Draft predictive flood mapping for Birr, Co. Offaly, which incorporates flood mapping for Riverstown, Co. Tipperary and part of the Little Brosna, has been produced by engineering consultants under the Shannon CFRAM Study.  A Public Consultation Day on the draft flood maps was held in Birr on 12th November, 2014.  The draft flood maps are currently available for inspection on the Study website and members of the public may provide feedback on same.  A national statutory consultation is due to be held later this summer.  All feedback received during the draft flood maps consultation period will form part of the process of finalisation of the flood maps. </p><p>Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the assessment of appropriate flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for future State investment in flood defences. </p><p>The Little Brosna river itself is part of a Drainage District, day to day responsibility for the maintenance of which lies with the Local Authorities in question, Tipperary and Offaly County Councils.</p></reply>

It is accepted practice, when considering changes to the remuneration of public servants in the context of inclusive negotiations on pay and conditions, to have regard to gross salary scales at all levels for the purpose of calculating increases or decreases to base rates.  The consideration of salary scale levels in this way has also applied to the discussions which have taken place in relation to the Public Service Stability Agreements. There is no anomaly as such.  The difference in pay reflects the now long-standing employee contribution towards pension benefits, allied with the revised and improved social welfare benefits available to that class of public servant and I have no intention of making any changes to these arrangements.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the 2013 legislation provides that the legislated pay reductions should in no case serve to bring the then existing annualised pay rate of a public servant from marginally above &euro;65,000 per annum (up to &euro;68,783) to below &euro;65,000. In such cases the reduction is restricted to reducing the scale to &euro;65,000 only.</p></reply>

The task of valuing c. 146,000 properties is significant as is the process of engagement with occupiers of properties who wish to make representations on their proposed valuations or to appeal their valuations to the Commissioner of Valuation or to the Valuation Tribunal.  To date revaluation has been completed in the four Dublin local authority areas, in Waterford and in Limerick. These revaluations represent 1/3 of the number of commercial properties but over half of the valuation base.  From a slow start, the revaluation programme has built a momentum and 2/3 of the revaluations have been completed between 2011 and 2014.  This progress has primarily been achieved with the current staffing levels.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 was recently enacted and I signed the Order to commence this piece of legislation on 8 June 2015.  This Act will allow the Commissioner of Valuation to outsource revaluation work and to value areas using Occupier Assisted Valuation.  It also streamlines the appeals process, removing the appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, and extending the period to make representations on proposed valuations.  These measures will help to accelerate progress on the revaluation programme.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the acceleration of the revaluation programme has increased the volume of appeals going to the Valuation Tribunal and additional staff were assigned to support the Valuation Tribunal on a temporary basis.  Under their delegated sanction from DPER to incur expenditure in 2015, both bodies may fill vacancies up to Assistant Principal level within their approved pay bills.  My Department also liaises with the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal on workloads arising from the reform and overall staffing levels are kept under review as necessary.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-09a.822.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015060900086#WRQ03300"><p>Since 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices improved.  We have moved from 20th to 16th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook and from 29th to 25th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 13th out of 189 countries, up 3 places since 2012.</p>  <p>  A key objective of the Action Plan for Jobs process which this Government commenced in 2012 was to rebuild our competitiveness and provide a solid foundation for future growth.  The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvement in competitiveness that has taken place in recent years.  Prices and labour costs have grown less in Ireland than in our trading partners.  Combined with the recent depreciation of the euro, this has seen Irish competitiveness - as measured by the real effective exchange rate - recover most of the deterioration recorded during the boom years.</p>  <p>  As noted in the Government&rsquo;s Spring Economic Statement, this recovery in competitiveness has facilitated a reallocation of resources towards the tradable sectors of the economy.  In the longer term productivity performance must be the vehicle through which we must improve our competitiveness and grow the economy.  Relentlessly pursuing cost competitiveness which remains vital to us as a small, export oriented economy is important but we must also sustain our focus on productivity growth across all sectors of the economy.  Structural reform, as championed through the Action Plan for Jobs, is essential to deliver the necessary productivity gains and improvements in competitiveness.  Such reforms are recognised as essential to improving the competitiveness of our exporting sectors, which will be at the heart of delivering on our ambition of having full employment by 2018.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of initiatives underway in the research, development and innovation space that entail significant cooperation with the UK. </p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) researchers are engaged with 145 companies in the UK.  These include British Sky Broadcasting, BT, Smith and Nephew, AstraZeneca, Cambridge Chemicals, Eli Lilly and many more.  This represents about 12% of overall SFI funded researcher collaborations with industry partners.  Eight of the top 10 international partner institutes for collaborations with SFI researchers in 2014 are UK based.  These collaborations amount to just under 9% of all international academic collaborations.  SFI and the Biotechnology and Biological Research Council (BBSRC) plan to launch a formal partnership in late Q3 2015.  The BBSRC, one of seven Research Councils in the UK, is the largest UK public funder of non-medical bioscience with key priorities in the areas of agriculture and food security, industrial biotechnology and bioenergy and bioscience for health.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland recognises the strategic importance of the development of an all-island economy on the basis that, in taking on the global market challenge, we can be more than the sum of our parts and extensive links have been forged with various agencies and bodies in Northern Ireland and with the UK.  Work in this context is focused on liaison with, and participation in, cross border bodies, close cooperation between Invest NI (INI) and Enterprise Ireland and close cooperation with UK agencies.  The inter-agency 2015 work programme between Enterprise Ireland, the UK Trade and Investment Agency and Invest NI includes a project to explore options for collaboration related to our national contact point Horizon 2020 activities, which has the potential to be beneficial to all.  Elsewhere, the all island Innovation Voucher initiative continues and this assists small firms to access innovative solutions available in the higher education sector north and south of the border, with the vouchers of &euro;5,000/&pound;4,000 giving these companies the financial support to get them on the first rung of the innovation ladder.</p>  <p>  Horizon 2020 represents a significant opportunity for North South cooperation.  Increasing successful applications and funding awards from Horizon 2020 is an important objective not just of the Irish Government but also of the Northern Ireland Executive.  The international collaborative nature of Horizon 2020 makes it ideally suited for Ireland and Northern Ireland to work together for mutual benefit.  The importance of North South collaboration is recognised by both Administrations and the alignment of our Horizon 2020 support structures, North and South, means that there is now a strong basis on which to grow this cooperation.</p>  <p>  The work of InterTradeIreland, the North South Trade and Business Development Body, has stimulated a move towards a more focused, coherent approach to co-operation that will be mutually beneficial.  This work is paying dividends and the number of North/South collaborations has been rising steadily.  To ensure that we build on this success and maximise the level of co-operation for the Horizon 2020 programme, a Strategic Action Plan for North South Cooperation in Horizon 2020 was launched in December 2014.

Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar are to the forefront of the 2015 investment programme with others scheduled to follow in subsequent years.  Galway, Dundalk and Limerick are earmarked for 2016, while Athlone, Carlow and Waterford are earmarked for 2017.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland regularly assesses property requirements in Regions and has identified locations where quality building and site solutions would enhance the winning of FDI for a region, commencing with the nine identified locations over the next 3-5 year period.  The locations identified provide a good offering to companies seeking to invest, for example, a good population base, the presence of a third level college, an existing base of FDI and indigenous companies and good transportation links.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the Advance Facilities announced recently represent less than half of total investment in property solutions as part of the new IDA Strategy.  Significant resources will be invested in utility intensive strategic sites which have a track record of attracting FDI as well as a substantial upgrade of large sections of the existing Business Park network to ensure an attractive suite of investment location options are available to potential investors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Action Plans for each of the regions, including the North East Region, which will be published in the near future.</p></reply>

Ireland was actively engaged in its formulation at that time.  The EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy asked Member States to develop national plans on the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles in 2013.</p><p>The Government decided on 24 June 2014 that Ireland would develop a national plan for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is leading the development of the plan.</p><p>An inter-departmental working group has been formed consisting of focal points from each Government Department and state agencies.

The Forum provided an opportunity for business, NGOs, trade unions and academics to exchange views on best practices in relation to Business and Human Rights and in particular with a view to informing the process of development and the content of a Plan to implement the UNGPS. </p><p>That Department also invited submissions from interested parties and received 30 submissions from civil society and the business community.

All military licence applications are subject to rigorous scrutiny and are considered in the light of the spirit and objectives of the 2008 EU Common Position on Arms Exports.

The remainder were from organisations including trade unions&rsquo; representatives, county councils, the Irish Farmers Association, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Organisation, Chambers Ireland, the American Chamber of Commerce, European Movement Ireland, Faith in Action, Ash Ireland, Peoples Movement Campaign Against TTIP, the Irish Recorded Music Association, the Future We Need, the Irish Cancer Society, the Young Friends of the Earth, and the European Filmmakers.</p>  <p>  As the issue of the negotiations on a possible trade agreement between the EU and the US is discussed on an ongoing basis, it would not be possible to provide the dates and details of all meetings that take place.  I regularly meet the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, and hosted her visit to Ireland on 27 March last when she also took the opportunity to meet with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on EU Affairs. I also meet regularly with fellow EU trade ministers.  </p>  <p>  I have met three times with the US Trade Representative, Mike Froman, in March 2013, just before he was appointed as USTR, in April 2013, when he came to Dublin at my invitation to the informal meeting of EU trade ministers during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, and in October 2014, during a trade mission to the US.  </p>  <p>  I frequently engage with Oireachtas Committees and individual Oireachtas members.  I met with Irish Members of the European Parliament on 28 May.  I have been invited to attend a special joint session on 23 June of three Joint Oireachtas Committees: Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Agriculture Food and the Marine, and EU Affairs, meeting in single session, to discuss TTIP.  </p>  <p>  I have hosted two seminars in Dublin Castle on TTIP, in June 2014 and in March 2015, to which Oireachtas members, all Irish MEPs, and business, trade unions and farm representative groups were invited.  I have participated in two round table discussions at the European Parliament Dublin office, one in December 2014, and the other, which took place on 26 May.</p>  <p>  Meetings at official level take place mostly between other officials.  My officials regularly meet EU Commission, Council and Parliament officials, as well as officials from other EU Member States.  Officials of my Department convene regular meetings of officials of other departments and agencies.  Other official level meetings that take place are with stakeholders including business, workers, farming and NGO interest groups.  The opportunity was provided recently to an NGO umbrella group called Uplift to meet with the interdepartmental group of officials.  Official level briefing sessions have been held for Oireachtas members and their advisors, and Members of the European Parliament and their advisors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-09a.872.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015060900087#WRR02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 421, 423 to 425, inclusive, 429 and 438 together. </p>  <p>  The provisions covering eligibility inspections under the Basic Payment Scheme and other Direct Aid Schemes are provided for in Title III of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 (previously Commission Regulation (EC) N0 1122/2009).  In accordance with this Regulation, such eligibility inspections can take the form of a ground inspection as part of a Remote Sensing inspection.  A review of the accuracy of the data held in the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is also provided for in the same Regulation.  Articles 28 and 29 of the Regulation provide that, applications under the Direct Payment Schemes should be subjected to both administrative and cross-checks to verify their accuracy and their compliance with the eligibility requirements of the Schemes.  One of the most important cross-checks undertaken is to verify the accuracy of area declared and land usage against the data stored in the LPIS.  In order to protect EU funds paid out under the Direct Payment Schemes, it is expected that the information held is as accurate and up to date as is possible.  The EU Commission can, and do, propose financial correction where the data held is not accurate or up to date.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, farmers in general, who submit applications under the Direct Payment Scheme and various other schemes and who are not satisfied with a decision made by my Department in the processing of these applications can appeal to the Agricultural Appeals Office.  In some instances where the volume of appeals submitted is extremely high, it is necessary to provide for an alternative appeals mechanism to process these in an efficient manner.  This was the case in respect of appeals submitted under the 2013 LPIS Review.  I, therefore, established the Independent LPIS Appeals Committee to deal with such appeals.  In view of the sheer volume of the number of appeals received - over 10,000 - it would not have been possible to process appeals under LPIS Review using the normal process.</p>  <p>  This Committee comprises of an independent Chairman and Appeals Officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office.  The Schedule to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 was amended by the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations 2013 (SI No. 10 of 2013) to exclude the Land Parcel Identification System Review 2013 (LPIS Review 2013) cases.</p>  <p>  Where persons were dissatisfied with a decision affecting them under the 2013 Review of Eligibility of Land parcels, they were entitled in the first instance, to have the decision reviewed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, where applicants were dissatisfied with the outcome of the review, they were granted the option to seek a review of that decision from the LPIS Appeals Committee.  If they continued to remain dissatisfied following the outcome of the Appeals Committee review, they were then afforded the option to pursue the matter with the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Terms of Reference of the Appeals Committee is available on the website of the Agriculture Appeals Office.  Each appeal case is decided on its own individual merits and an individual recommendation is forwarded from the Committee to my Department. </p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that the review and appeal process is as robust as it should be and applicants are given every opportunity to make their case.  If there are any queries arising from the applicant&rsquo;s review and/or appeal procedure, my Department arranges to carry out an on-site verification check to confirm the information submitted by the applicant. </p>  <p>  During a LPIS Review Process, ineligible areas and features are excluded from the LPIS land parcels as declared by applicants.  In many instances, such exclusions will not have any monetary impact as the farmers were declaring lesser areas than the adjusted reference areas.  In other instances, as many applicants declare more land than the number of entitlements held, the adjustment will not lead to the imposition of any deduction or penalty on BPS.  In any event, all applicants, whose parcels were adjusted following a LPIS Review, are written to in relation to the adjustment.  This letter is accompanied by map(s) of the adjusted parcels which details the new as well as existing exclusions.  The letter and maps are issued irrespective of whether the adjustments led to a deduction in payment or not.  In fact, many of the appeals submitted by applicants under the LPIS Review related to cases with no financial deductions or sanctions.  Applicants in receipt of these notifications are entitled to avail of the review and appeal process already outlined.     </p>  <p>  A LPIS Review involves the assessment of the latest ortho-imagery available for lands parcels, on the Land Parcel Identification System, which are declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes.  The objective of the assessment is to identify and exclude any ineligible areas or features from the land parcels declared by farmers in their applications for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes in order to ensure that the applications are validated correctly.  The assessment is normally undertaken using the latest ortho-imagery available but in some instances it is necessary to carry-out a follow-up verification visit on the ground to confirm the findings of the assessment.  Such verification visits may relate to one or more parcels on a farm.

These inspections are mandatory and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.</p>  <p>  Rules regarding the advance notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials in my Department.  The regulations allow my Department to give notice for land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRs other than those related to animal identification and registration, food, feed, and animal welfare.  However this notice must be strictly limited to the minimum time period necessary and shall not exceed 14 days.  For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration the maximum advance notice is 48 hours. For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an un-announced basis.  Where it is considered that the purpose or effectiveness of any type of inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice, the inspection will take place on an un-announced basis.  In determining the type of notice to be given for an inspection a number of factors are considered so as to ensure that the inspection process is not jeopardised.   </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a revised Farmers Charter in conjunction with the various Farming Organisations and this document will include details on the notification periods for inspections, as prescribed in the governing EU legislation.</p></reply>

Rather, the principle of equivalence will be the basis for trade.  Essentially this means that, while food production processes need not be identical in the EU and US, these processes must provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production in order for trade to take place.  Under the equivalence principle, it is the importing Party that decides whether the conditions for equivalence have been met.</p>  <p>  In addition the negotiating directives agreed by the EU for these negotiations preserve &ldquo;the right of the Parties to take measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives on the basis of the level of protection of health, safety, labour, consumers, the environment and the promotion of cultural diversity..., that they deem appropriate&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The principle of equivalence together with the right of reservation on policy grounds should provide good protection for Irish consumers and will allow the EU to retain its current approach to food standards.  This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production.  The EU Commission has made it clear in the negotiations that it will not countenance the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.</p>  <p>  The reality is that Ireland has strong offensive interests in these trade negotiations, particularly in the agri-food sector.  We are seeking greater market access for dairy products both in terms of tariff reductions and removal of regulatory barriers.  Key exports would be branded packaged butter, powdered products and sports products.  We are also interested in meats &ndash; both beef and pork &ndash; and in opening the US market to Irish lamb.  The expectation in the past was of a limited opportunity or niche market for exports of beef to the US.  However, because of the recent higher prices in the US, the US market will become more attractive for other lower value beef cuts.  Consumer foods are also a potential area for growth, particularly porridge oats.</p>  <p>  Of course, on beef, we have defensive interests as well although our defensive interests are tempered by recent developments in US prices and our gaining of access to the US market for Irish beef.  Nevertheless it is important that any quota granted to the US does not undermine the absorption capacity of the EU.  Furthermore any quota agreed with the US would need to be matched with a quid-pro-quo quota for EU beef in the US.  Ireland would be well placed to benefit from such a quota, with our first mover advantage on the US market.</p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with Minister Bruton and his Department on this matter.</p></reply>

EU Regulation 1380/2013 sets down Ireland&rsquo;s Fishing Capacity ceiling from 1 January 2014.  This ceiling is expressed in terms of gross tonnes (GT) and engine power (kilowatts &ndash; kW) and covers the total fishing capacity of fishing vessels flying Ireland&rsquo;s flag.  Each Member State must manage entries into its fleet and exits from its fleet in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is compensated by the previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the &ldquo;entry/exit regime&rdquo;.  As Minister I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under Section 3 (3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006.  I am precluded from  getting  involved in individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p><p>Segmentation of the fishing fleet has been a feature of the industry from the establishment of the EU Fishing Fleet Register in 1990.  The Irish fishing fleet is divided into five segments in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The segments are as follows: Refrigerated Seawater (RSW) Pelagic Segment; Polyvalent Segment; <i>Beam Trawler Segment</i>: <i>Specific Segment: Aquaculture Segment.</i></p><p>In addition, the policy sets out a number of sub-segments of the fleet including a sub-segment for vessels exclusively using pots, vessels targeting scallops and polyvalent vessels under 18 m in length.  The transfer of capacity between the segments and sub-segments is not permitted, and equivalent &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; capacity must be taken out of the segment or sub-segment into which a vessel is being introduced. </p><p>In order for vessels to qualify for either a mackerel and/or herring Authorisation, vessels must be licensed with 100% capacity having the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies. </p><p>Please note that fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded commercially, bought and sold independently of the Department and the Licensing Authority.</p><p>The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  The current fleet policy allows operators to introduce new or replacement vessels and to modify existing vessels subject to the operator providing replacement capacity from the relevant segment and sub-segment.  The current policy has been put in place over many years and a change, as requested, would impact many elements of the fishing fleet. It could potentially have significant impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  I do not want to create an expectation we can go down the road of &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo;, which is what was available based on the application of very strict criteria, in the past, because &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo; is specifically not provided for in the new Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>There are many diverse views within the fishing industry and these often conflict.  It is important for the further development of the industry that views on any changes to be made are debated widely internally in the industry and that there is the maximum possible level of agreement and support within the industry for any proposed changes being sought by the industry.  Where the industry, preferably through the recognised representative structure of Producer Organisations, makes a business case for changes to the licensing policy on the basis of changed circumstance, I would examine any such case.  I would encourage the group of vessel owners who are calling for this major change to long standing policy to engage widely with the Producer Organisations so that any proposed changes can be brought forward with widespread support from across the industry.  The changes being proposed would significantly impact many operators in the industry.  Any amendments to licensing policy, that I might bring forward, will be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

EU Regulation 1380/2013 sets down Ireland&rsquo;s Fishing Capacity ceiling from 1 January 2014.  This ceiling is expressed in terms of gross tonnes (GT) and engine power (kilowatts &ndash; kW) and covers the total fishing capacity of fishing vessels flying Ireland&rsquo;s flag.  Each Member State must manage entries into its fleet and exits from its fleet in such a way that the entry of new capacity into the fleet is compensated by the previous withdrawal of at least the same amount of capacity.  This is known as the &ldquo;entry/exit regime&rdquo;.  As Minister I have responsibility for policy in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing under Section 3 (3) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2003, as amended by Section 99 of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006.  I am precluded from getting involved in individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the licensing authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p><p>Segmentation of the fishing fleet has been a feature of the industry from the establishment of the EU Fishing Fleet Register in 1990.  The Irish fishing fleet is divided into five segments in accordance with Ministerial Policy Directive 2 of 2003, as amended.  The segments are as follows: Refrigerated Seawater (RSW) Pelagic Segment; Polyvalent Segment; <i>Beam Trawler Segment</i>: <i>Specific Segment: Aquaculture Segment.</i></p><p>In addition, the policy sets out a number of sub-segments of the fleet including a sub-segment for vessels exclusively using pots, vessels targeting scallops and polyvalent vessels under 18 m in length.  The transfer of capacity between the segments and sub-segments is not permitted, and equivalent &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; capacity must be taken out of the segment or sub-segment into which a vessel is being introduced. </p><p>In order for vessels to qualify for either a mackerel and/or herring Authorisation, vessels must be licensed with 100% capacity having the required track record as stipulated under the individual mackerel and herring fleet policies. </p><p>Please note that fishing capacity is privately owned and is traded commercially, bought and sold independently of the Department and the Licensing Authority. </p><p>The request for a change in licensing policy involving the removal or amalgamation of segments or sub segments would have a substantial impact on the Irish fishing fleet.  The current fleet policy allows operators to introduce new or replacement vessels and to modify existing vessels subject to the operator providing replacement capacity from the relevant segment and sub-segment.  The current policy has been put in place over many years and a change, as requested, would impact many elements of the fishing fleet.  It could potentially have significant impacts on access to fishing resources and the management of quotas.  I do not want to create an expectation we can go down the road of &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo;, which is what was available based on the application of very strict criteria, in the past, because &ldquo;safety tonnage&rdquo; is specifically not provided for in the new Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>There are many diverse views within the fishing industry and these often conflict. It is important for the further development of the industry that views on any changes to be made are debated widely internally in the industry and that there is the maximum possible level of agreement and support within the industry for any proposed changes being sought by the industry.  Where the industry, preferably through the recognised representative structure of Producer Organisations, makes a business case for changes to the licensing policy on the basis of changed circumstance, I would examine any such case.  I would encourage the group of vessel owners who are calling for this major change to long standing policy to engage widely with the Producer Organisations so that any proposed changes can be brought forward with widespread support from across the industry.  The changes being proposed would significantly impact many operators in the industry.  Any amendments to licensing policy, that I might bring forward, will be subject to a public consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence.  The fact that producers will face a super-levy bill in relation to the final year of the system is obviously unwelcome.  However, the rules governing the imposition of a super levy were set by regulations agreed at EU level. It was not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.</p><p>However, new arrangements recently introduced by the Commission, following consistent requests from Ireland and other Member States for some relief on the super levy bills being experienced by milk producers, allow Member States to facilitate the payment by milk producers of this super levy liability in three annual instalments, without interest.  The first instalment must be collected by the milk purchaser in the normal way and paid to my Department before 1 October 2015 and the two subsequent payments must be paid by similar dates in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>I certainly recognise the severe financial hardship that is being placed on milk suppliers because of high levels of super levy and for that reason<b></b>I have taken the decision to avail of this new arrangement.</p><p>Officials in my Department are currently finalising procedures for the collection of the first instalment before end of September 2015; and the introduction of a Scheme to collect the remaining instalments in end September 2016 and end September 2017.  I expect to be announcing the details of the scheme in the very near future.</p><p>It is worth mentioning at this stage that I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new quota free era with confidence.  Ongoing contact has been maintained with the Minister for Finance to ensure that existing and future taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.  Of interest to dairy farmers here will be the announcement in last October&rsquo;s budget to provide for income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills.  I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan.  In addition, I have impressed upon the Irish banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015.</p><p>I am satisfied now that this mix of measures, the worst impacts of the superlevy have been mitigated to the greatest extent possible and that the dairy sector can look to the future with confidence.</p></reply>

The framework for this is provided under the European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations 2010 (SI 558 of 2010).  In accordance with these Regulations the public notification of applications is by way of the Department&rsquo;s website and details of all applications for consent to afforest are placed on this site.  My Department is currently reviewing the legislative basis for consents following the passage of the Forestry Act, 2014.  The issues raised about wider public notification of applications will be considered in that context.  The submission of forestry management plans is a condition of receipt of payments under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme.  Standard templates are provided at establishment stage with a more detailed forest management plan to be submitted for forests of 5 hectares or greater when they have reached their 11th year of maturity.  The Department is currently working on an on-line forest management plan system which includes the design features of the plan.</p>  <p>  As regards set back distances from buildings from new forestry, the standard set back distance is 60 metres from dwellings and associated buildings, or 30 metres where the written consent of the owner is give before approval.  In advance of the submission of an application, forest developers are advised to consult with neighbouring owners where issues are likely to arise in relation to the proximity of the development.  The Department may also require such consultation as a condition of any proposed application for approval. While the 60 metres setback is considered reasonable in the majority of cases, my Department may insist on greater setbacks, or the exclusion of areas from an application, where it considers that this is necessary for landscape reasons.   </p>  <p>  The species selection as part of an application under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme is a matter for the landowner subject to it comprising a minimum of 10% broadleaves.  The tree species proposed for planting must also have regard to its suitability to the site and soil conditions.  The premiums payable under the Scheme are highest for broadleaves reflecting their longer maturity and reduced commercial potential in the short to medium term. </p>  <p>  The rates of premium payable under the Scheme have been approved both at national and EU levels and represent an increase, in annual terms, on the rates available under previous Schemes.</p></reply>

BiaFoodInitiative have met <font color="#222222">Tesco, who are providing equipment and some other support.  </font>The Department of Social Protection is supporting staffing of the hub and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has provided advice on carrying out the business in a safe way in compliance with the food regulations, given that such organisations come under the definition of a food business in the general food law.  In March BiaFoodInitiative joined Bord Bia&rsquo;s online Origin Green Platform , which provides access to a network of over 400 companies, who could include this as a waste reduction measure in their Origin Green action plans.</p><p>FoodCloud connects businesses that have too much food to charities in communities that have too little.  Using the FoodCloud app, or the website, participating businesses can upload details of their surplus food and the time period in which the food can be collected.  This automatically sends a text message to the most appropriate charities in their community.  The first charity to accept the offer collects it directly from the business.  By donating surplus food to various charities, businesses can assist them in reducing their food costs and therefore allow them to redirect funding to programs assisting those who are disadvantaged, creating long tangible and long lasting local benefits.  Following a successful pilot programme, Tesco Ireland and FoodCloud last year announced a partnership that will see all surplus food from Tesco&rsquo;s stores redistributed to charities and community groups through the use of FoodCloud&rsquo;s innovative app.</p><p>There is much to be said for promoting voluntary engagement by the industry with such initiatives before consideration by Government on whether legislation is appropriate.</p></reply>

The sampling of 103 deer was completed in January 2015. The study revealed that some 4.8% deer had visible lesions and 15.5% cultured positive overall.  A previous survey in this region in 2008 found a lower visible lesion rate but the culturing methodology used was different.</p>  <p>  The exercise also involved the culling and examination of badgers from the same area.  26% of the badgers were cultured positive for TB.  Strain typing to show linkages between the TB in deer, badgers and cattle in the area has not been completed yet.</p>  <p>  The findings in Wicklow indicate that, as expected, there are pockets of deer where infection is present.  The high level of TB infection in badgers is also of concern and may well be a key factor in this multi-host outbreak of the disease.  There is an active badger control programme in operation in Wicklow and this has led to a reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle in recent years.</p>  <p>  Under the Wildlife Acts, responsibility for wild deer rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Officials from my Department provide on-going advice to keepers and their veterinary practitioners on disease control measures and bio - security in relation to wildlife, including deer, and are available to discuss these issues with herdowners.</p>  <p>  A non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF) has recently been established, with an independent chairperson and includes representation from stakeholder groups, including farming, forestry, conservation, hunting and other interest groups as well as Coillte and officials from my Department and from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Results from the Wicklow deer study have been passed on to the Forum and these will be discussed at the next meeting, due to take place this month. It is intended that this forum, including all of the stakeholder representatives, will assess and progress all aspects of deer management.</p></reply>

The BDGP utilises the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.</p><p>The BDGP was approved under the agri-environment provisions of the Rural Development Regulations and will contribute to an important reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd. The Programme&rsquo;s six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers. Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration. The commitment timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, facilitating planning and budgeting on their farms for the duration of the Programme. </p><p>It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases a penalty will be applied. However, I am satisfied that the approach reflects a proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment applies only in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is caused by circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as illness or disease. My Department has also confirmed that where an applicant sells or leases his/her land, or transfers it by inheritance or gift, there will be no clawback of funds. Of course, where an applicant retains sufficient land to fulfil the requirements of the programme (the maximum payable area), he/she is required to continue to meet its terms and conditions on an ongoing basis. </p><p>While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014. It was not possible to select a future date because a scheme approved under the RDP could not provide an incentive for increasing stock numbers. Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facilitate early payments under the scheme. The provisions do, however, allow the use of 2015 as an alternative base on an exceptional basis for new entrants, applicants impacted by force majeure circumstances in 2014 and for those who would have been excluded from the scheme as a result of a reduction in stock numbers in 2015. Applications to use 2015 as a base will be considered as a case by case basis.</p><p>Many farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for 4 and 5 star animals. Analysis undertaken by ICBF on the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme has indicated that some 30% of herds are already compliant with the requirement that the number of 4 and 5 star females are equal to 50% of the reference animals on each farm. Furthermore, 52% are already compliant with the 2018 requirement that 4 and 5 star females are equal to 20% of the reference animals on each farm. All farmers will receive comprehensive training and advice to assist them in introducing the required breeding strategy. These requirements will take time to introduce and this is why there is a 5 year lead-in time included in the design of the programme. </p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &lsquo;reference animals&rsquo;. The number of reference animals will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme. For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype nine cows/heifers/calves/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition. While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. </p><p>The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.</p><p>Both my Department and the ICBF have published Questions and Answers documents to address queries being raised by farmers. Scheme applicants can contact my Department directly with any specific queries they may have and, in addition, they will also receive additional information specific to their herds in the coming week which will provide a useful overview of the current position of their herds.</p><p>Finally, I believe the high level of applications reflects the significant interest in this programme and the benefits it can deliver to our beef sector. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review. Should a need to change aspects of the Programme arise, I will address these issues subject to approval of the EU Commission, in a manner consistent with the objectives of the programme and relevant regulation.</p></reply>

These fisheries primarily target bivalve shellfish including mussel seed, razor clams, scallops and cockles.</p><p>With regard to protected sea-floor habitats, the Department is continuing to give a high priority to the risk assessment of sea-fisheries in accordance with the Programme of Measures in the Birds Case.  The Department has introduced a number of risk mitigation responses, particularly in the case of bivalve dredge fisheries, in order to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Birds and Habitats Directives for protected habitats and species.  These include precautionary closures of Natura 2000 sites to activities which require appropriate assessment; regulatory closures of sensitive features within Natura 2000 sites and requirements to report the location and nature of fishing activities, including the use of GPS monitoring devices.  Information on this work is publicly available on .</p><p>Stakeholder involvement in the process of regulating sea-fisheries is enshrined in both the Common Fisheries Policy and, in the case of Natura 2000 sites, the Aarhus Convention. In order to ensure that adequate opportunity for early and effective participation is provided, I announced the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) in May 2014. The NIFF delegates comprise the Chair and Vice Chair of six multi-stakeholder Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) for which membership includes a broad spectrum of marine users, including environmental representatives. To date, the work programme for Natura 2000 sea-fisheries has featured highly on the agenda of the Inshore Forums and I must commend the NIFF delegates for their continued engagement on this complex issue. Natura 2000 sites such as Blacksod Bay include a variety of habitats and species, each with varying sensitivities and in introducing measures to manage sea-fisheries regard must be had to the specific conservation objectives for each habitat and species within the site. I have committed significant resources to implementing the work programme, including funding the costs of studies, surveys and GPS monitoring devices and the programme continues to draw heavily on the expertise of the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p></reply>

Its role is not to agree those rules in the first place; that is the responsibility of the Regional Group of Member States, the North Western Waters Group.</p><p>That Group has, only last week, unanimously agreed on a Discards Plan for demersal fisheries that will cover all of the waters around Ireland as well as the Channel that will come into effect from the 1<sup>st</sup>of January 2016.  The development of the Plan was undertaken in close consultation with stakeholders, including Environmental NGO&rsquo;s, through the North West Waters Advisory Council.</p><p>The Environmental NGO&rsquo;s had a full opportunity to engage in this process of developing this new Regional Plan and in fact a representative of the Environmental NGO&rsquo;s was invited (by Ireland, as Chair of the Group) to, and attended all of the meetings of the Member States Group. Their views were fully taken into consideration throughout the intense negotiation process that finally culminated in an agreement last week.</p><p>It is the fishing industry which will now have to implement this new agreement. It is the individual vessel operators who will have to abide by the new rules as they are phased in and who must deal with the practical issues arising from the application of the landing obligation. Consequently, I must reiterate that I do not consider it necessary that environmental non-governmental organisations, which will not have any direct role in implementing the landing obligation, become part of the DIG. The Environmental Pillar have been and will continue to be regularly updated on the Group&rsquo;s deliberations and this will remain the case.</p><p>I reject the assertion that my Department is in thrall to commercial interests at the expense of the public interest in protecting the environment. The work that I and my officials have done, and continue to do, to try and ensure long term sustainable fisheries firmly demonstrates that this is not the case.</p><p>My overarching objective since becoming Minister, and that of my Department, with regard to fisheries in Ireland, is to do all I can to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector. That objective is always balanced with the need to ensure that fish stocks will be protected for future generations and negative environmental impacts from fishing activities are reduced to the lowest possible level.</p><p>I work closely with <i>all</i>stakeholders and will continue to do so to achieve these objectives.</p></reply>

Accordingly, competitions are open to any individual or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions. There are no such restrictions or embargoes in place on Israeli companies.</p>  <p>  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.</p>  <p>  The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition usually on the e-tenders site in line with the EU Directive on the procurement of Defence and Security equipment.</p>  <p>  The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has consistently been opposed to proposals for trade, diplomatic, cultural, academic, sporting or other boycotts of Israel. In the absence of a general trade embargo of Israel, the Department of Defence cannot unilaterally preclude Israeli companies from participating in tender competitions for military or any other type of goods.</p></reply>

It operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  Eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters, including the Deputy Force Commander, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. </p><p>Following the significant events in August 2014 in the area of separation, there was a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimizing unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  Most UNDOF personnel are now deployed on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  The UN provides regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.  The presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East region. </p><p>  Participation by the Defence Forces in UNDOF is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  On 17 June 2014, the Government approved continued participation in the UNDOF mission for a period of twelve months up to June 2015.  I intend to bring proposals to Government in due course for the continued participation by the Defence Forces in the mission beyond June 2015, subject to the renewal of the UN authority for the mission.</p></reply>

In July 2014 the alleged perpetrator, Mr. Mahmoud Bazzi, who had been residing in the United States was arrested for administrative immigration violations.  Following an immigration court hearing in August, the Judge ruled that Mr. Bazzi be deported to Lebanon.  Mr Bazzi was deported from the United States to his native Lebanon on 30 January 2015.  On arrival in Beirut, Mr. Bazzi was arrested and detained by the Lebanese authorities where he remains in custody. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government have requested the support of the Lebanese Government in seeking justice for the murdered Irish UNIFIL peacekeepers, should such action be feasible.  During my visit to the Lebanon last December, I met with the Lebanese authorities at the most senior levels of Government and highlighted the Irish Government&rsquo;s continued commitment and interest in progressing this case.    </p>  <p>  It is now a matter for the Lebanese authorities to investigate the case and to determine any future action in accordance with their national legislation and judicial procedures.  The Irish Ambassador in the region is continuing to monitor developments in the case and is in contact with the Department of Defence on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence is also maintaining contact with the Barrett and Smallhorne families in relation to the case.</p></reply>

Discussions at the meeting covered a wide range of European Defence and Security issues and associated challenges. </p>  <p>  I am also kept fully apprised of issues arising from meetings which officials from my Department attend in the area of European Defence and Security.  As with the formulation of any policy, best practice and lessons learnt in other jurisdictions will always inform EU policy formulation to ensure that it is robust, coherent and meets the needs of member States.   </p>  <p>  As previously advised in response to the Deputy's Question No. 416 of 24 March 2015, the response to acts of terrorism within the borders of the EU falls outside the remit of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).

In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes.  All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels in addition to their fishery protection role undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard.

The events show that all States must remain vigilant and attentive to the risks posed by international terrorism. </p>  <p>  The issue is a matter of ongoing concern to me and my ministerial colleagues across the European Union and will be on the agenda for the upcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council on the 15th and 16th June next.  Officials from my Department meet regularly with their European counterparts and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close links with their European and international colleagues in relation to the threat posed. </p>  <p>  Ireland, like any other democratic country with similar values, is not immune to a threat from international terrorism.  While an attack on Ireland is possible it is not assessed as likely and there is no specific information in relation to a threat to Ireland, there are a small number of people based here who support extremism.  The activities of these people are closely monitored by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also keeping the level of threat from international terrorism under continuous review in light of ongoing developments and continuing to take all appropriate measures to counteract this threat. In this they have the full support of the Government. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into force on the 8th June 2015, creates the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.  These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. </p>  <p>  While primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.

In accordance with relevant international and European Law any claims for international protection by persons who are rescued is the responsibility of the state of disembarkation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that section 8 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) provides that any person who arrives at the frontiers of the State or any person who at any time is in the State seeking the status of a refugee may apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality for a declaration of refugee status.  There is therefore no legal basis for accepting extra-territorial applications.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the granting of refugee status, the Deputy might also note that the processing of asylum applications in Ireland takes place within a well defined national and international legal framework.  All applications for refugee status are examined in accordance with the statutory requirements set out in the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  Accordingly, where a person makes an application for refugee status in Ireland their application is examined at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and, on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as a further part of its response to the crisis, the Government has agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people as its contribution to helping alleviate the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.

This office provides those services to non-nationals who are resident in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  This service is currently run by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Visa section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality also operate from this office to issue re-entry visas to non nationals travelling outside the State who require such a visa to return to the State.</p><p>In relation to the visa services provided, the Deputies will be aware. that there was, during December last, an unprecedented level of demand for re-entry visas &ndash; well above volumes of previous years - which led to long queues forming.  Decisive immediate action was taken with significant additional resources re-deployed to the re-entry visa office with the result that by the end of the first week in December all persons who came to the public office were dealt with on the same day.</p><p>To avoid a recurrence of such unexpected demand and queues developing, I asked my officials to bring forward their proposals for the introduction of an on-line appointment service for the re-entry visa process.  Design of the system is at an advanced stage and is expected to be in place shortly.  I should reiterate that applications for re-entry visas may be made by post so there is no necessity to attend at the public office and I would urge applicants to make as full use of this service as possible.</p><p>Extensive arrangements in place to deal with demand at Burgh Quay office which is one of the busiest public offices in the State with approx 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office.  Specifically, in relation to the GNIB The GNIB public office is one of the busiest in the State and at its peak period from September to mid November, when student registrations are at their highest, it will process up to 500 persons per day.  Special arrangements are put in place in September, October and November to facilitate the registration of students in major public and private colleges.  Periods of time in these months are set aside in the public office of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), specifically for registration of students. </p><p>The GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open 13 hours a day from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, thus ensuring those attending are dealt with on a <i>'first come first served&rsquo;</i>'  basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each non national on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation that is required for registration, so that delays are avoided.  Last year the office opened on some Saturdays to deal with the high level of demand in the autumn peak.  In recent weeks the Garda National Immigration Bureau with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has established an alert on the &quot;latest news&quot;  section on the home page of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Website for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an alert is posted on the Garda Website alerting persons to the number of available tickets remaining at Burgh Quay. </p><p>Tickets are not issued to non-nationals whose registration relates to their presence in Ireland for study related purposes, until after 9am so as to facilitate those non-nationals whose permission to reside in the State is work related and who attend at the office between 8am and 9am.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau endeavours to provide a 'same day service', for non-nationals who pay the required fee for a 'registration certificate' by way of Debit/Credit card.  A person paying the said fee by way of 'bank giro' is required to return to the registration office on another day when the said payment has been verified, for the purpose of being issued with a registration certificate.  Otherwise, a situation where a non-national is required to attend at the registration office on a second day will usually arise only where he/she attends at the office at a time of the day when a significant number of persons availing of the registration service who have arrived earlier in the day, have yet to be attended to.</p><p>It is a requirement of the registration function that persons seeking to register present in person to their local registration office.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  The registration process includes an interview with the person, the examination of relevant documentation, photographing and biometric capture and the issuing of a registration certificate.  It also includes the placing of the appropriate permission to remain endorsement on the passport of the person concerned.  It should also be noted that for most persons, renewal of their registration is at most a yearly requirement and that for the majority of customers the GNIB provides a same day service<i></i>at its Burgh Quay office.</p><p>As I indicated in earlier replies on this matter, it is my intention to transfer the registration of non nationals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  This work is underway and it is also intended to develop customer services such as on-line booking systems to ensure greater certainty for the customer.</p><p>I place a high value on customer service and both GNIB and INIS will continue to examine and introduce any practical changes to improve the customer experience and to ameliorate demand.  Naturally, any public office operates with a fixed capacity and at particularly busy periods and not withstanding any arrangements put in place, there may be occasions when, based on the numbers seeking to register and estimated processing times, processing capacity is reached for that day; persons attending beyond that point will be asked to return at another time.  In such circumstances GNIB &amp;amp; INIS manage demand on the day in a  sensible, proactive and safe manner. There is no necessity for people to queue outside of office opening hours. </p></reply>

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p><p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325</i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. </i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

This Unit acts as a conduit between RIA and Tusla, the latter having statutory functions in this area.  RIA has a well established Child Protection Policy which is based on the Tusla's 'Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children' and this policy was agreed in cooperation with Tusla.  All centres have designated Child Protection Liaison Officers and all staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.</p><p>Notwithstanding that the recommendations in the Report are directed to Tusla, both that body and RIA are engaging in relation to its findings and both are committed to working together to improve services for children and families in direct provision.

In this regard, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to implement a range of strategies based on existing legislation and enhancing partnerships with local communities.</p>  <p>  A range of strong legislative provisions are available to an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between local Garda&iacute; and the community and the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Within this framework, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to tackle local crime issues including public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities and business groups, to reduce crime and enhance community safety.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour and related criminality. I am advised that there is a community policing team in each Garda District.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the question of establishing additional task forces or other structures are concerned, I would point the Deputy to the existing structures, both formal and informal, for local cooperation and problem solving in relation to crime and community safety issues.  In particular, the Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) provide a forum for the development of strategic responses on issues such as anti-social behaviour, in cooperation with the local authority and the elected members for the area as well as community representatives.  New guidelines published in August last year specifically require JPCs to take a strategic and coordinated approach in developing their plans to address issues of local concern, including issues along the lines referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

All information that the applicant wishes to have taken into consideration should be included with their application.  </p>  <p>  Where the stated purpose of the application is to marry in Ireland, it is advisable to provide evidence of that intention in the form of an acknowledgement from the Registrar.  The applicant must show evidence of their relationship with their prospective spouse. The list of documents required are attached on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The appropriate type of visa is a short stay visa under which the maximum stay allowed is 90 days. </p>  <p>  As with all applications for short stay visas, the applicant must show that they have sufficiently strong family, social or economic ties to a place of residence in a country other than Ireland to assure the visa officer assessing the application that the projected stay in Ireland will be temporary and in accordance with the duration and the conditions of the permission granted by the immigration authorities on arrival in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Where the stated purpose of the application is to join family in Ireland, the comprehensive statement of national immigration policy on the area of family reunification contained in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification was published on 31 December 2013.  This outlines the policies that apply to all decision making in relation to family reunification cases.</p>  <p>  The financial consideration for the Join Family visa where the sponsor is an Irish Citizen states that an Irish Citizen must not have been totally or predominantly reliant on benefits from the Irish State for a continuous period in excess of two years immediately prior to the application and must over the 3 year period prior to the application have earned a cumulative gross income over and above any State benefits of not less than &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  Declared and verified savings by the sponsor or the applicant may be taken into account in assessing cases.  It is not proposed that the Family Reunification determinations should be purely financial assessments.  Nevertheless, the State cannot be regarded as having an obligation to subsidise the family concerned and the sponsor must be seen to fulfil their responsibility to provide for his family if they are permitted to come to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on the visa application process can be found on the INIS website (www.inis.gov.ie).  It should be borne in mind, however, that the information contained on the website is intended to act as guidance only; it does not limit the discretion of the visa officer in dealing with individual applications.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

My aim, if possible, is that all the necessary legal provisions to make civil marriage available to same-sex couples would be in place in August.  The policy intention, made clear in the Heads of Bill published on 9 March, is that where a couple have made a notification or completed a civil partnership registration form for a date after commencement, they will be able instead to have that notification deemed to apply to a marriage, and they may complete a marriage registration form.  This will not be an automatic process, but officials from the civil registration service will, in the coming weeks, be contacting couples to ensure they are aware of the option should they wish to avail of it.</p>  <p>  Civil partnerships will not be automatically converted into civil marriages, because it is a change in status and cannot be imposed without the full, free and informed consent of the parties.  Civil partnered couples who wish instead to marry may do so through the normal procedures applying to a civil marriage.</p></reply>

It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative or at the request of a party to the proceedings, invite all the parties to consider mediation as an alternative means of resolving the dispute and suspend the proceedings to facilitate that process.</p><p>The Mediation Bill is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Supreme Court judgment in the Article 26 referral of the Employment Equality Bill 1996, in which the court found that the provision - which later became section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 - struck a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved here.  Accordingly, it is essential that the reform of section 37 should strike an appropriate balance as between freedom of religion, which incorporates freedom of religious groups to establish their own institutions, including educational institutions, on the one hand and the right of individual as employees to be free from discrimination, on the other.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned before, the Government supports the aims of this Private Member's Bill to strengthen the protection afforded to LGBTI persons and I will be bringing forward a number of amendments to improve the Bill when Committee Stage resumes in the Seanad. The details of these amendments will be published as soon as they have been drafted and approved by Government with a view to the Bill's early enactment.</p></reply>

It was introduced following the advice of successive Attorneys General that it was required, following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the <i>Corway </i>case in order to give legislative effect to the offence of blasphemy contained in Article 40.6.1(i) of the Constitution. Therefore, whether the legislative provision can be removed will depend on whether the constitutional position of blasphemy is changed by referendum.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government agreed last September to hold a referendum on removing the offence of blasphemy contained in Article 40.6.1.1 of the Constitution, in response to the 6th Report of the Convention on the Constitution.

Its enactment will be a key element in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides a capacity test which will be used by the court and by healthcare professionals to determine whether or not a person has capacity.  Where a person is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and lacks the capacity to make decisions without some form of assistance, there will be a number of support options available.  The court will be able to appoint a decision-making representative to take specified decisions on the person's behalf where the court finds that the person lacks capacity to take such decisions.  A person will also be able voluntarily to appoint a co-decision-maker to take decisions jointly with him or her.  In addition, a person will be able, as at present, to appoint an attorney under an enduring power of attorney to take decisions once the person no longer has capacity.</p>  <p>  Where the court has appointed a decision-making representative or where an enduring power of attorney has been registered, it will no longer be possible for the person with Alzheimer's disease to take decisions or to sign documents in relation to the decisions for which a decision-making representative or an attorney have been appointed.  Similarly, the person will have to take decisions and to sign documents jointly with the co-decision-maker on matters encompassed by the co-decision-making agreement.</p>  <p>  The Bill does not give any intervener the right to become involved in the making of a person&rsquo;s will and the normal avenues available to those who wish to contest a will remain open.</p>  <p>  Decision-making representatives, attorneys and co-decision-makers will all be answerable to the Office of the Public Guardian.</p>  <p>  Committee Stage is scheduled for 17 June and it is my expectation that the Bill will be enacted this year.</p></reply>

However, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to my proposal, approved by Government on 6 May 2015, for the drafting of the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill which will provide for the introduction of additional measures for the enforcement of civil debt.</p><p>The proposed Bill will implement a number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission (LRC) in relation to the enforcement of debt.  The<b><i></i></b>LRC Report published in 2010 on <i>Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement</i>made a number of recommendations for wide scale reform of the existing personal insolvency and debt enforcement regimes.  Key elements of that Report were implemented through enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p><p>The new Bill seeks to implement further recommendations of the Report aimed at enforcement and recovery of debts which could be developed to streamline the existing enforcement procedures. Under the proposed Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, creditors may apply to the court for an order enabling either attachment of earnings or deductions from social welfare payments, as appropriate, for the purpose of enforcement of debts to which the legislation will apply.  Attachment of earnings would arise where a court orders the debtor&rsquo;s employer to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s earnings to pay over to the creditor. Deduction from social welfare payments would arise where the court orders the Department of Social Protection to deduct specified sums from the debtor&rsquo;s social welfare payments to pay over to the creditor.  However, these provisions will be subject to a number of safeguards for debtors and will have regard to the debtor's capacity to repay the amount owed.</p><p>Importantly, the Bill will also make provision to provide for the abolition of imprisonment of debtors except in the case of maintenance arising from family law proceedings.  This implements one of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this area.  Under existing law, arrest and imprisonment remains a possibility as an enforcement mechanism of last resort in cases where a creditor has proved beyond all reasonable doubt the judgment debtor has failed to comply with an instalment order due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  The proposed Bill removes this possibility for the vast majority of debtors.&quot;</p><p>The Bill is currently being drafted.  It is expected to be published this month with a view to enactment before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  While the review of all the cases referred to the panel is not yet completed, my Department has received the recommendations of counsel in a significant number of cases. I will consider the recommendations of counsel extremely seriously, and as a general comment let me say that I cannot easily imagine circumstances where I would not follow such recommendations.</p>  <p>  Having received the first batch of submissions on those cases which were completed, I was anxious not only to set out the recommendation of counsel and my decision on it, but to outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  Great care will have to be taken in setting out the main points made by counsel in a way which respects the rights of everyone concerned and ensures the independence and objectivity which have been the hallmark of this process to date.  I have therefore decided to appoint a former judicial figure to advise on the preparation of the letters.  Retired High Court Judge Mr Justice Roderick Murphy has agreed to undertake this task. I believe that Mr Justice Murphy's involvement in the process will offer additional reassurance to those whose cases were considered by the Panel.</p>  <p>  I believe it is better to take that time now so as to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.</p></reply>

Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a fine.</p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy of existing laws in the area of prostitution.  Under section 6 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  It is also an offence under the 1993 Act to organise prostitution, to knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute or to keep or manage a brothel.

As a result, the identification of each individual deportation by scheduled commercial flight could lead to identification of the individuals in question.  Accordingly, it is generally only where Ireland leads on or participates in a deportation charter that a limited amount of detail is published on the INIS website.</p>  <p>  In enforcing the law in respect of deportations, Ireland is no different to other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to remain within their territory.  Ireland, like other EU member states, uses deportation of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers as the policy of last resort.  The process leading to a deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.  It should also be noted that a Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and it is only where they fail to do so that the State is forced to remove them and enforce the rule of law.</p></reply>

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In February 2014, the Government approved the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill, which will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.

While it was originally anticipated that a referendum to amend Article 34 of the Constitution might be required in order to remove any constitutional obstacle to the establishment of a separate Family Court, more recent examination of the issues arising in this context indicates that it will be possible to proceed with the establishment of the Court in a manner which does not require such a referendum. This can be achieved by establishing the family court as a separate division within the existing court structures. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising proposals for future legislation based on submissions which have been received and consultations with interested parties. I intend to bring my proposals to establish the new Family Court to Government as soon as they are finalised.

The organisation is funded by Tusla up to the end of June 2015. </p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are front-line services rooted in the community they serve.  They offer an open door and respectful service.  This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions and timely referrals to appropriate services and for more intensive and targeted work as required.  Acting as a focal point within their community, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families.  This is inclusive of children and families who may have a disability.   </p>  <p>  Tusla values the work of DESSA and recognises the impact of its work across the Family Resource Centre Programme.  I am assured by Tusla that the existing Family Resource Centre network has the capacity to deliver the services in question and to the required level.  Tusla intends to build on the significant strengths of Family Resource Centres in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support.  In this regard, Tusla is providing funding of &euro;13.09m to 109 Centres across the country in 2015.</p>  <p>  In seeking to improve outcomes and well being for children and young people, Tusla must ensure that it makes the most efficient use of its resources and in a way that is efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable. Tusla is giving particular priority in 2015 to the protection of front-line services and those which are best aligned to the priority outcomes as set out in the Agency's Corporate Plan.  </p>  <p>  Tusla is in receipt of Exchequer funding of &euro;643m in 2015 which represents an increase of &euro;34m or 5.6% over 2014. The level of funding provided represents tangible evidence of this Government's commitment to improving services for the most disadvantaged children and families.  </p></reply>

They comprise local representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, childcare providers and parents.  There are now 31 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County CCs.  </p><p>City and County Childcare Committees offer a wide variety of services locally including; advice on setting up a childcare business; childcare information sessions; training courses for those considering a career in childcare; and advice and support on applying for childcare programmes.  City and County Childcare Committees also offer services to parents, such as providing information on local childcare facilities and information on parent networks.</p><p>The role of the CCCs was expanded under the National Childcare Investment Programme to enable greater flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, and they had a key role in the development of local childcare infrastructure, quality standards and training and information.  More recently, CCCs have been increasingly dedicated to locally managing administrative processes associated with the national childcare support programmes (the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and the Training and Employment Childcare programmes).  They also provide advice and support regarding the performance and sustainability of childcare services in their respective areas.</p><p>The CCCs work collaboratively and collectively with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Pobal and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to achieve this.There is ongoing review of programmes to ensure effectiveness and  that there is no duplication.  Pobal's primary function is the provision of technical administrative support in respect of programme delivery nationally while the CCCs focus on more local level issues. The very strong data management role that Pobal plays is a key factor in the Department's ability to review and assess programmes effectiveness, efficiency and value for money.</p><p>Each CCC receives annual funding from my Department and details of the allocations for 2015 are shown in the attached table.</p><p>City/County Childcare Committee Allocations 2015</p><p><table><tr><th>CCC</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div>224,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td><div>234,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td><div>304,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td><div>299,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td><div>482,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td><div>363,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td><div>826,200</div></td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td><div>373,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td><div>460,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>454,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>347,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>385,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td><div>255,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td><div>230,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td><div>209,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick *</td><td><div>546,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td><div>209,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td><div>304,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>313,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td><div>381,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>234,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td><div>241,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td><div>234,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td><div>234,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin</td><td><div>472,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipp North</td><td><div>234,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipp South</td><td><div>245,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford *</td><td><div>458,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td><div>241,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>352,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td><div>307,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>&euro;10,450,200</div></td></tr></table></p><p>*Limerick City Childcare Committee and Limerick County Childcare Committee have merged</p><p>*Waterford City Childcare Committee and Waterford County Childcare Committee have merged</p></reply>

The direct provision system comes under the aegis of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), as part of  the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  HIQA reviewed all referrals to Tusla relating to children living in direct provision over a 12 month period.  Additionally, HIQA visited four Tusla administrative service areas to review files and meet managers and social workers.  The report stated that direct provision centres were present in 14 out of 17 administrative service areas.  The report concluded that the quality of service being provided was mixed, with evidence of good service delivery in the majority of areas and some poor practice in the remaining areas.  The report noted that good support and social work practices by Tusla staff were evident.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has accepted the recommendations from the report and is currently finalising an action plan to address comprehensively the issues raised.  My Department, Tusla and RIA are committed to working together to improve child protection and welfare services for children in direct provision.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, is taking steps to address issues relating to the asylum seeking process by introducing a single procedure to manage applications for protection in the International Protection Bill.  Further, my Department is represented on the Working Group on the Protection Process, set up by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This Group has a particular focus on direct provision and is independently chaired by former High Court Judge Bryan McMahon. My Department has taken an active interest in the work of the Group, and has contributed developmental papers as well as commenting on child welfare and protection issues during their deliberations.

The Centre&rsquo;s budget for 2015 is set at &euro;90,453. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Tusla that representatives met with members of the Voluntary Board of Management last December regarding the provision of funding to the Centre under the Family Resource Centre Programme. The Centre has been without a full-time Co-Ordinator since March 2013. This has impacted on the management and operation of the Centre in terms of services to children and families in the community and the continued development of the Centre in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. Tusla will continue to work with the Centre and representatives from these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to a community-based service that is operating to its full potential and best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families, in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a decision has been made to establish a new Family Resource Centre based in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. A new legal entity will be formed. The current Voluntary Board of Management  of Kenmare Community Care will be re-constituted. It will initially include community representatives from the Family Resource Centre referred to and Kenmare Community Care. </p>  <p>  In time, it is proposed that the new Voluntary Board of Management will also include community representatives from Tahilla, Castlecove and Kilgarvan. The detail of this will be a matter for discussion and agreement under an agreed process which is being managed and facilitated by Tusla.  The first meeting in this agreed process was to take place last month but was cancelled due to the unavailability of some representatives.  Tusla has requested that the first meeting be rescheduled to a suitable date within the next two weeks.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that the existing Family Resource Centre will continue to administer its Programme funding until the process is completed and will continue to receive Tusla funding for counselling services during the process.</p></reply>

There is now a single line of accountability and a consolidated national budget which is reserved for allocation to these particular services.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s budget for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender based violence services is in excess of &euro;19m in 2015. Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of these services over recent months. The purpose was to identify strategic priorities and set out a  roadmap for the future delivery of sexual violence and domestic violence services.  </p>  <p>  Tusla considers, arising from the review, that there is scope for a more co-ordinated and more equitable approach to the provision of these services across the country. As part of this process Tusla has reviewed the configuration of domestic violence services in Co. Westmeath and has identified scope for some degree of re-organisation and reconstitution of services while ensuring continuity for service users. Tusla has assured me that there is no question of services in the county being reduced.  Indeed I have emphasised to Tusla the importance of ensuring that front line services are protected.</p>  <p>  Westmeath Support Services Against Domestic Abuse was in receipt of &euro;47,146 in funding from Tusla last year.

I am assured by Tusla that the change in funding arrangements constitutes a re-allocation rather than a reduction in funding.  Furthermore, Tusla has committed to enhancing the availability of services to women and children experiencing domestic violence in the Westmeath area. </p>  <p>  Tulsa, in reviewing the make up of current services, is seeking to address any identified gaps in services, to avoid duplication and to support effective delivery of frontline services nationally.  </p></reply>

It was intended that officials visit Russia in January of this year; however, it was decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation before continuing the detailed negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports. It is imperative that this matter is fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p></reply>

This funding will provide grant aid, in the region of &euro;500,000, for significant upgrades of community/not-for-profit services, such as major refurbishment or relocation to new premises. Also under this strand of funding, grants of up to &euro;50,000 will be available for essential maintenance, or works undertaken to improve the energy performance.  </p>  <p>  The remaining &euro;2 million in capital funding is being made available for both private and community/not-for-profit childcare providers to access grants of up to &euro;500 for quality improvement measures, specifically in the area of upgrading IT facilities.

The programme was open to both community not-for-profit childcare facilities and private childcare facilities.  The aim of the funding was to provide support to childcare settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment.</p>  <p>  It is a requirement of all early years capital funding programmes administered by this Department that applicants must be providing services under at least one of the Department's childcare support programmes.</p></reply>

The Centre&rsquo;s budget for 2015 is set at &euro;90,453. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Tusla that representatives met with members of the Voluntary Board of Management last December regarding the provision of funding to the Centre under the Family Resource Centre Programme. The Centre has been without a full-time Co-Ordinator since March 2013. This has impacted on the management and operation of the Centre in terms of services to children and families in the community and the continued development of the Centre in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  Tusla fully recognises the need for community-based family support services serving the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. Tusla will continue to work with the Centre and representatives from these communities to ensure that the funding currently available under the Family Resource Centre Programme is directed to a community-based service that is operating to its full potential and best supports and promotes the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families, in line with Tusla&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a decision has been made to establish a new Family Resource Centre based in Kenmare to serve the communities of Sneem, Tahilla, Castlecove, Kilgarvan and Kenmare. A new legal entity will be formed. The current Voluntary Board of Management  of Kenmare Community Care will be re-constituted. It will initially include community representatives from the Family Resource Centre referred to and Kenmare Community Care. </p>  <p>  In time, it is proposed that the new Voluntary Board of Management will also include community representatives from Tahilla, Castlecove and Kilgarvan. The detail of this will be a matter for discussion and agreement under an agreed process which is being managed and facilitated by Tusla.  The first meeting in this agreed process was to take place last month but was cancelled due to the unavailability of some representatives.  Tusla has requested that the first meeting be rescheduled to a suitable date within the next two weeks.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that the existing Family Resource Centre will continue to administer its Programme funding until the process is completed and will continue to receive Tusla funding for counselling services during the process.</p></reply>

This includes a provision of &euro;992 million in current expenditure and &euro;35 million in capital expenditure, which in Vote terms, represents an overall increase of &euro;30 million, or 3%, over the 2014 allocation. </p>  <p>  The Estimate for 2015 contains significant additional resources to fund the services and programmes provided by Tusla - the Child and Family Agency. This amounts to &euro;643 million, which accounts for 63% of the Vote allocation, and represents an increase of &euro;34 million or 5% against the 2014 allocation. While I understand that this level of funding cannot address all of the challenges that the  Agency faces in doing its work, I believe that the additional funding allows the Agency to alleviate the pressures on the range of services currently in place.  It will also help Tusla to build on the extensive programme of reform across the range of services for children and young people, a process which is well underway. Officials in my Department continue to closely monitor the cash position of Tusla and are working on an ongoing basis to monitor its financial requirement. Any discussions regarding additional resources for Tusla will take place in the context of the Estimates process.</p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that there were 1,425.02 whole time equivalent social workers employed at the end of April 2015 and that they are currently recruiting an additional 124 social workers to meet existing vacancies. While a zero rate of vacancies in this specialised area of work would be ideal, it is important to acknowledge that, as staffing vacancies arise for a variety of reasons, including retirements, career breaks, paid and unpaid leave (including maternity and other family related leave) and resignations, in that context there will always be gaps in timing around the filling of posts. Every effort is being made by the Agency to speed up recruitment and develop a comprehensive workforce development plan in 2015 which will assist in addressing staff turnover rates and hopefully lower them further. </p>  <p>  The policy in place and utilised by Tusla states that all children coming into care, and those in high risk placements, have an allocated social worker.  Maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities all contribute to gaps in staffing, which can cause strain on the allocation of social workers.  According to Tusla policy, where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, they are responded to by a duty team on a risk management basis for any change in circumstances.  During this time, specific pieces of work on the child's case may be undertaken by staff working in the duty system. Also, structures are in place to regulate and inspect service provision, including the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I am satisfied that, overall, the necessary services and supports are in place to ensure the care and welfare of children in State care. </p></reply>

Children qualify for the free pre-school provision when they are within the qualifying age range which is 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 will qualify in the school year commencing in September 2015.  There is currently no provision under the programme to enrol children who are below the qualifying age. </p>  <p>  It is likely however, that this current eligibility criteria will be considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education, which I established in February this year. This Inter-Departmental Group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector.

The organisation is funded by Tusla up to the end of June 2015.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are front-line services rooted in the community they serve.  They offer an open door and respectful service.  This universal accessibility allows for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions and timely referrals to appropriate services and for more intensive and targeted work as required.  Acting as a focal point within their community, Family Resource Centres provide a holistic service of child, family and community support and advocacy to all children and families.  This is inclusive of children and families who may have a disability.</p>  <p>  Tusla values the work of DESSA and recognises the impact of its work across the Family Resource Centre Programme.  I am assured by Tusla that the existing Family Resource Centre network has the capacity to deliver the services in question and to the required level.  Tusla intends to build on the significant strengths of Family Resource Centres in meeting its mandate for community-based early intervention and family support.  In this regard, Tusla is providing funding of &euro;13.09 million to 109 Centres across the country in 2015.</p>  <p>  In seeking to improve outcomes and well being for children and young people, Tusla must ensure that it makes the most efficient use of its resources and in a way that is efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable. Tusla is giving particular priority in 2015 to the protection of front-line services and those which are best aligned to the priority outcomes as set out in the Agency's Corporate Plan.</p>  <p>  Tusla is in receipt of Exchequer funding of &euro;643 million in 2015 which represents an increase of &euro;34 million or 5.6% over 2014. The level of funding provided represents tangible evidence of this Government's commitment to improving services for the most disadvantaged children and families.</p></reply>

The Inter-Departmental Group will submit its report to Government by end June 2015.</p>  <p>  The development of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy is also being progressed in my Department. The objective of this Strategy is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  It is my intention that it will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life as well as identifying best practice in other jurisdictions, such as those referred to by the Deputy. I have signalled my intention to conduct focused consultations with relevant parties across the early childhood care and education sector before concluding my own deliberations on this Strategy.  I am also mindful of the importance of other work which is being undertaken in parallel in respect of the future investment priorities in respect of childcare.</p></reply>

It brings together a range of measures designed to support providers in the challenge of continually improving the quality and standards of early years services throughout the country. One of the most important measures relates to the inspection of early years services.</p>  <p>  New Child Care Regulations are currently being finalised.  These Regulations will introduce a new registration system that will require anyone who wants to establish an early years service to register with Tusla before they open.  Premises will be inspected by the Early Years Inspectorate before registration is granted, and there will be on-going inspections once the service is operating and children are attending.  These new Regulations will also be accompanied by new National Standards for Early Years Services, against which services will be inspected. </p>  <p>  In addition to this work, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills is leading focussed inspections of the quality of educational provision in the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme.</p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years settings are also planned. All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification. In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent to qualify for ECCE. To support staff to meet these new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which allocated &euro;3 million to almost 2,500 staff for the purpose of up-skilling.</p>  <p>  The recent establishment of Better Start further demonstrates my commitment to ensuring excellence in early years services. The aim of Better Start is to provide a nationally coherent continuum of support to providers to help them to improve quality, incorporating the work of the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations.  Each year, my Department provides some &euro;13 million to City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisation. This funding supports the valuable work of these bodies in supporting early years&rsquo; services around the country, through training, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups.</p>  <p>  Better Start also incorporates the work of a new nationally coordinated Early Years Specialist Service. This Service has recruited and trained 30 graduates in early childhood care and education to work directly with services in a mentoring capacity to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum.</p>  <p>  While significant progress has been made, my Department will continue to progress the Early Years Quality Agenda. Indeed, this is one of a number of issues that is being considered by the Inter-Department Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education.</p></reply>

This draft report included a separate appendix by a HSE staff member in Cork providing information based on records from the former Bessborough mother and baby home. The author of this draft report acknowledged that its conclusions remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE. </p><p>As these matters were outside the direct remit of the McAleese Committee, the HSE subsequently advised that these wider concerns would be examined separately by the HSE. At that time my Department advised the HSE that any validated findings of concern from this separate process should be appropriately communicated by the HSE through a separate process.  This Department is not aware of any subsequent reports supplied by the HSE in this regard.</p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs became actively involved in responding to the concerns relating to Mother and Baby Homes following the publication of information on the former Bon Secours Home in Tuam around mid-2014. The Inter Departmental Review Group was set up by my predecessor to assist Government in its deliberations on the terms of reference of a Commission of Investigation and to map the important dimensions of the issues in the short time available. The more extensive process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a very significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work. The Group's Report cites a range of academic research and published social histories which explore matters related to Mother and Baby Homes and demonstrates that concerns in relation to the role and purpose of these institutions have been the subject of attention, report and debate since their establishment in the early years of the State.</p><p>This work culminated in the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in February 2015. Using its extensive legal powers, this Commission is now examining matters within its comprehensive terms of reference to ensure that what happened to vulnerable women and children in Mother and Baby Homes is fully examined. Its findings will be published.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, together with the terms of reference set out in S.I. No. 57 of 2015, provides this Commission with all necessary powers to comprehensively examine the broad range of public concerns that have been expressed in relation to mother and baby homes.</p></reply>

In order to ensure the effective implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures my Department has established a robust infrastructure to guide and support cross-governmental delivery of the framework. The Children and Young People's Policy Consortium is composed of high level representatives from all of the key Government Departments and Agencies, and it has responsibility for driving implementation. It is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, with a Deputy Chair from the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of Better Outcomes, Better Futures, each of the five sponsoring Departments have identified a cross-sectoral priority to progress within the Framework.  The Department of Social Protection have identified child poverty as their key cross-sectoral priority.  The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in coordinating government strategies on child poverty and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.</p>  <p>  To support this, the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Advisory Council, which brings together key individuals from the community and voluntary sector, as well as others with experience of working with and for children and young people, have formed a subgroup with the objective of working with key officials from the Department of Social Protection to progress this cross-sectoral priority.

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.  On foot of a Government decision, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed, on the basis that this would prevent hardship and, on an interim basis, alleviate stress, anxiety and uncertainty among a vulnerable group in society.</p></reply>

Cumulative savings and cost avoidance generated from these Agreements between 2006 and 2014 amount to approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</p>  <p>  The State's existing price reduction Agreement with the IPHA commenced in 2012, and will run until the end of October 2015. Savings of over &euro;400 million are to be delivered as part of this Agreement, with &euro;210 million of these savings to be reinvested into provision by the State of new and innovative drugs.</p>  <p>  Consideration is now being given to a range of options available to the State in seeking to deliver further savings on the cost of drugs. Such options include entering into a new Agreement with IPHA as well as the possibility of using the legislative powers afforded to the HSE under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to review and alter prices.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health are currently working with their colleagues in the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the State achieves the best possible deal in terms of future price reductions on the cost of medicines. I am confident that a new arrangement will be put in place which will ensure that further price reductions are achieved for the benefits of patients and the taxpayer.</p></reply>

Reporting on these rates has been hampered by different definitions of stillbirth both nationally and internationally. In Ireland, four difference agencies are involved in the compilation and reporting of perinatal data mortality data.  The analysis presented in the Report of the Chief Medical Officer into Perinatal Deaths in Portlaoise Hospital (February 2014) showed that there are weaknesses and inconsistencies in perinatal data collection, collation and reporting.</p>  <p>  A number of actions are being taken to address these discrepancies as follows:</p>  <p>  - The notification of stillbirths is a mandatory requirement in the Civil Registration Act (2004).  This Act was amended in 2014 to make notification of early neonatal deaths mandatory.  The General Registration Office is working on the commencement of this.</p>  <p>  - In addition the HSE has agreed to progress agreement of definitions and reporting of perinatal statistics in Ireland.  This would include systems such as the NPRS and the NPEC.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 of the CMO's Report states that the HSE should ensure that the National  Perinatal Reporting System (NPRS) and the National  Perinatal Epidemiological Centre (NPEC) are consolidated to create a single national reporting system for official statistics on perinatal events in Ireland.  I am aware that the HSE has commenced work on this recommendation and I have asked the Executive for an update on progress.</p>  <p>  Perinatal death is a rare event in Ireland.  Given the small numbers involved the use of perinatal mortality rates by hospital as an indicator of patient safety creates a risk of false reassurance and also can raise false alerts.  It is, therefore, important to look at these in conjunction with, for example, confidence intervals per hospital and other methods in order to distinguish between the stability of estimates based on small versus large numbers. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of perinatal data by hospital for the reasons set out.</p></reply>

This will provide a roadmap to better maternity services. It will ensure that women have access to safe, sustainable, well staffed maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs. An extra &euro;2 million has been included in the HSE National Service Plan 2015 to address current pressures within the Maternity Service.  The measures proposed by the HSE include the appointment of 7 consultant obstetricians.</p><p>Planning and providing for future manpower needs is pivotal. At present, there are 42 doctors on the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Specialist Medical Training (HST) programme for Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynaecologists 2015/2016, which is a 5 year programme.  This compares to 33 trainees in clinical posts at any given time as approved by HSE, up to 2014. For the 2014/2015 intake year this was increased to 38 trainees in clinical posts<i>.</i></p><p>I also expect that the revised pay scales for new entrant consultants agreed between Management and the IMO at the LRC on 7th January 2015 will help us to keep more of our medical graduates at home and persuade consultants who are working overseas to return to Ireland. I want this new package to send a strong message to Irish medical graduates that pay and also working conditions are improving again and that they can be part of the health recovery in Ireland. The recruitment of additional consultants, in particular, obstetricians, is a priority and arrangements are in train to recruit consultants.  A joint HSE/Public Service Appointment project team has been appointed to progress the recruitment process for consultants.</p></reply>

My Department is completing the legal work to allow for the Act to be formally commenced.  The Act provides that operational responsibility for the identifiers may be assigned to the HSE.  It is intended that the register of Individual Health Identifiers will be implemented first. Preparations for the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier are at an advanced stage by the  HSE.  The necessary management and organisational structure to enable the establishment of the register are being put in place, a development plan is currently being drafted which will give indicative costs for the lifetime of the project, some technical implementation work has begun and a Privacy Impact Assessment has been commissioned and is nearing completion.  When the establishment of the Individual Health Identifier register is complete the next phase will be to allow for other health ICT systems in both primary and acute care to access the register and make it available as the Act allows. This work will take time to complete and I must emphasise that this is primarily a patient safety initiative. The work will be done on a phased basis over a number of years.</p>  <p>  All ICT elements of the project are subject to project approval by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. HSE has estimated the ICT related costs for the initial phases of the project to set up the register for completion in 2015 will cost &euro;1.3 million approximately. Further work on estimating ICT related costs for the roll out the system of identifiers to other areas such as acute hospitals, mental health, etc have yet to be completed.</p>  <p>  HIQA are currently engaged in a public consultation exercise on "Draft Governance and Management Standards for Health Identifiers Operator in Ireland" which will assist in underpinning a governance framework for the operation of the system of identifiers to ensure trust and confidence of the health identifiers system in the country. It is important to point out that the roll out of a system of health identifiers for patients, professionals and organisations has no linkage with any eligibility for any type of health service or benefit. It is primarily a patient safety initiative and a fundamental building block for eHealth and ICT developments into the future.</p></reply>

While the issue of perinatal hospice care is outside the scope of the Strategy, I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the Palliative Care For Children with Life-Limiting Conditions in Ireland - A National Policy, which was published by my Department in March 2010.  The policy places significant emphasis on caring for children in their own homes rather than recommending the development of a children's hospice.  With regard to perinatal services, the best location of care is within the maternity or paediatric setting.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to ensure that quality palliative care is available to all those who need it.  In that regard, the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Hospitals Division, in partnership with the Clinical Palliative Care Programme, the Primary Care Division and the Irish Hospice Foundation, has recently commenced a programme of work to support general, maternity and paediatric hospitals to develop comprehensive plans for palliative, end-of-life and bereavement care.  Each maternity unit will identify how it can best support the palliative care needs of parents and their babies.  It is considered that this approach is preferable to establishing a very limited number of separate services.</p>  <p>  A programme of care for children with life-limiting conditions has been established including the appointment of a Paediatric Consultant with a Special Interest in Palliative Care, based in Crumlin.  As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  Eight Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses have also been appointed, and a further two nurses will be appointed this year.</p></reply>

It is given to prevent the most serious forms of tuberculosis in children such as TB meningitis.  The vaccine is given by HSE community doctors in health centres or maternity hospitals as it is administered intradermally.</p>  <p>  The licensed supplier of BCG vaccine has informed the HSE that the delivery of BCG vaccine has been further delayed.  A lack of BCG vaccine stock is an international problem for EU member states as well as UNICEF who are having difficulty obtaining supplies of BCG vaccine.  BCG vaccination clinics in HSE sites and Maternity hospitals have been deferred until new stock arrives.  The HSE is in close contact with the vaccine manufacturer to expedite delivery of new stock as soon as possible. Local Health Centres will arrange appointments for BCG vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is restored.</p>  <p>  The HSE is aware of alternative suppliers of BCG vaccine which are not licensed in Ireland and is in consultation with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) about sourcing this alternate supply.</p>  <p>  No cases of TB were reported in Ireland in children less than 4 years of age in 2014.  There is no threat to public health from this temporary vaccine shortage.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-06-09a.1588.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015060900100#WREE02300"><p>As set out in my previous reply, Government policy has been to move towards charging the full economic cost for the provision of private acute in-patient services.  Persons who opt to be treated on a private basis on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  Those charges are a per diem rate set out in the 2013 legislation and were informed by overall cost of the provision of the private in-patient services and the policy of moving towards the recovery of full economic cost, but they are not directly related to the cost of specific treatments provided to individual private patients, the level of complexity of a case or the costs of individual hospitals. </p>  <p>  The issue of hospital financing has been the subject of recent Departmental reports. In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended.  It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs.  Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system.  Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).  </p>  <p>  Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.  It would require substantial technical work and analysis on the financial impact on public hospitals.  The focus for the short to medium term is on implementing ABF in the public system, as outlined in the recently launched HSE ABF Implementation Plan 2015-2017.  Until this further work has been completed it will not be possible to present the Deputy with the figure requested.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of health services and will have their choice of health insurer from a mix of private health insurers and a publicly owned health insurer. </p>  <p>  When I became Minister for Health, I reviewed progress to date and the timescales for implementing very important reforms, including UHI.  I concluded that it would not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.  However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing reforms, as set out in the Programme for Government and Future Health, and I want to push ahead with key building blocks for universal healthcare, including the phased extension of GP care without fees, implementation of key financial reforms, including activity-based funding, the establishment of Hospital Groups and improved chronic care management, as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and the HSE, is currently working on a major costing exercise to examine the cost implications of a change to a multi-payer, universal health insurance model as proposed in the White Paper.  Initial draft results were presented to me at the end of May and these are now informing deliberation on next steps, including the necessity for further research and cost modelling.</p></reply>

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The hearings commenced on the 10 March and concluded on the 23 April.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product. MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  It is expected that the Bill will be published during the Spring/Summer Session 2015.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria  including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.

The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita) and the harms caused by alcohol.  The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The other measures (e.g. for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations.  The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and some of these measures are reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2015.  The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse last year, in view of the key they play in co-ordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria  including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014.  The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed. It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The hearings commenced on the 10 March and concluded on the 23 April.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  It is expected that the Bill will be published during the Spring/Summer Session 2015.</p></reply>

This review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise.</p>  <p>  The review is considering the long term sustainability of the Scheme including funding arrangements.  No decisions have been taken nor plans in place regarding changes to the to the way the Scheme currently operates.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively.  A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is almost complete, and it will be finalised and made public as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.  Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region rather than by county and for the intervals as shown below.  The information on waiting times for treatment for Quarter 1 of 2015 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th>1 - 6 months</th><th>7 - 12 months </th><th>13 - 24 months</th><th>25-48<br /><br />months</th><th>Over 48 months</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td>1,140</td><td>875</td><td>1,432</td><td>1,208</td><td>199</td><td>4,854</td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td>258</td><td>483</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,546</td><td>672</td><td>3,969</td></tr><tr><td>HSE South</td><td>783</td><td>740</td><td>758</td><td>1,488</td><td>66</td><td>3,835</td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td>839</td><td>1,152</td><td>2,103</td><td>1,209</td><td>64</td><td>5,367</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,020</td><td>3,250</td><td>5,303</td><td>5,451</td><td>1,001</td><td>18,025</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.  Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  Since 1 January 2014, day-case private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to a daily charge of either &euro;329 or &euro;407 depending on the hospital treating the patient.  The private in-patient charge goes towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital&rsquo;s services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), laboratory services (such as blood tests etc.), medicines, and capital costs.</p>  <p>  People with limited eligibility (those who are ordinarily resident but not eligible for a medical card) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services.  The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 per night, to a maximum of &euro;750 in any twelve consecutive months.  People may take out private health insurance to meet the cost of private medical care.  A person may claim tax relief in respect of the cost of certain qualifying medical expenses paid where the cost is not covered by the HSE or by private health insurance or has been, or will be, the subject of a compensation payment.</p>  <p>  I do hope that this answer adequately explains the current position.</p></reply>

There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card </i>Eligibility and the <i>Medical Card Process Review</i>in November 2014.  Key findings of the Expert Panel were that it would not be feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility and that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  Following publication of the two reports, in November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that a Clinical Advisory Group has been appointed and it will provide an interim update on its work this month on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions, so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them.  </p><p>The medical card system is now operating in a more sensible and sensitive manner.  The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by over 63% from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 85,000 at the end of April this year.</p></reply>

SPHE is mandatory at primary level.  It forms part of the new 'Wellbeing' component of the Junior Cycle Framework.  Schools are encouraged to provide an SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p><p>Schools are active in this area.  The latest data available to the Department of Education is through the Lifeskills survey, 2012.  The findings from this survey indicate that the vast majority of primary and post primary schools are providing their students with the skills and knowledge needed to enable them to make healthier lifestyle choices.  For example, 97% of primary, and 66% of post primary schools, reported in 2012 that they promote healthy lunches.  Similarly, more than 90% of primary and more than half of post primary schools reported having a healthy eating policy in place. </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills is currently finalising guidance for schools that is intended to promote 'Healthy Lifestyles' among the student population.  This guidance encompasses measures to promote P.E. and physical activity, as well as healthy eating and healthy vending.  It has been drafted in consultation with the Department of Health and the HSE.  This guidance will issue in September 2015, to coincide with the publication by the Department of Health of updated Guidelines on Healthy Eating Policies.

In response to the high number of suicides and self-harm presentation in recent years, both jurisdictions have separately agreed national strategies for action: <i>Reach Out &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention</i>(2005), and <i>Protect Life - A Shared Vision - The Northern Ireland Suicide Prevention Strategy</i>(2006).  Both jurisdictions are currently finalising work on the development of two new Suicide Prevention Strategies, and these will be published in June (Ireland) and September (Northern Ireland). </p><p>An All-Island Action Plan on suicide prevention has been developed between the Department of Health, the Department of Health, Social Services, and Public Safety, the Public Health Agency (PHA) and the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).  Particular actions arising from this approach have included, understanding risk issues particularly for young men, the roll-out of Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), the extension of the National Registry of Deliberate Self-Harm into Northern Ireland, and the sharing of training resources.  There has been significant cooperation between the PHA and the NOSP in relation to these measures.  </p><p>The NOSP, as part of its programme of work, will in partnership with the Department of Health and the health authorities in Northern Ireland further develop and implement the All-Island Action Plan focusing on knowledge transfer, sharing of resources and information of programmes that are exemplars of good practice.  Officials from the both departments and agencies meet on an annual basis to share information and to consider further areas for collaboration.</p></reply>

The HSE's current figures are that 56% of babies in Ireland are breastfeeding on discharge from maternity hospitals.</p><p>In 2005 the Department of Health&rsquo;s Breastfeeding Strategic Action Plan was developed to provide for more effective promotion, support and protection for breastfeeding in Ireland.  In order to achieve this the HSE appointed a National Breastfeeding Co-ordinator and a multi-disciplinary National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee to oversee the implementation of breastfeeding strategy and initiatives. </p><p>In 2013, the Institute of Public Health in Ireland was engaged to conduct a Review and Evaluation of the Strategic Action Plan.  The Review concluded that the most significant achievements of implementation related to:</p><p>-  the development of standardised policy to guide consistent service development and monitoring within HSE maternity services; </p><p>-  enhancements in training for nurses and midwives;</p><p>-  the expansion of appropriately trained community-led peer support programmes;</p><p>-  the development of continually refined media messages to promote breastfeeding;</p><p>-  the development of more consistent and readily available information including the national breastfeeding website.</p><p>The review highlighted areas where more work needs to be done.  A core issue related to fostering greater engagement with the issue across a variety of sectors and investing in community level as well as health service-led approaches.  The other priority themes proposed for future action related to enhancements in messaging, training, community support, maternity service staffing, antenatal care and education, managing commercial interests and breastfeeding education in schools.</p><p>All 19 maternity units participate in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative as organised by the World Health Organisation. The HSE also promotes an annual National Breastfeeding Week and provides the website as a resource for supporting women in breastfeeding.  The HSE is developing a Breastfeeding Action Plan 2015 - 2020 in response to the review and there will be a national consultation day.</p></reply>

Four consultant transplant surgeons remain. Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of any vacancies poses a challenge.  Every effort is currently being made to fill the two vacancies.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in relation to a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants, as well as the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service.  It is proposed that pancreatic transplants, of which 6 were performed in 2014, will move to St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital this year.  While the transfer of such transplants to St Vincent&rsquo;s has been agreed in principle, it will take some time to make the detailed arrangements to facilitate the commencement of this work.  Most pancreas transplants are combined with a kidney transplant.  The arrangements being put in place for such cases will involve transplant surgeons from both St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital and Beaumont Hospital working together on the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.</p>  <p>  Gardasil vaccine has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006.  It was first introduced into the national immunisation programme in Ireland in 2010 and it is estimated that over 55 million girls and women have been vaccinated worldwide since it was first authorised.</p>  <p>  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit/risk profile for Gardasil remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.</p>  <p>  Up to the 31/05/2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 861 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions in association with Gardasil.  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p>  <p>  The HPRA published updates relating to national monitoring experience on its website during the first year of the HPV schools immunisation programme, with additional updates on national monitoring experience included in several editions of its Drug Safety Newsletter.</p></reply>

The Commission's registration and enforcement procedures are designed to protect the health, welfare and safety of all residents accessing in-patient mental health services.</p>  <p>  The Commission adopts a responsive approach to regulation.  Where an approved centre is non-compliant under the regulations, rules or codes of practice under the Act, the Commission takes account of the service's conduct and behaviour when deciding on regulatory action to be taken.  Consequently, if a service demonstrates a willingness to comply with regulatory requirements and can provide the Commission with evidence to support these efforts, the Commission will consider these actions.  The Commission endeavours to support services to achieve full compliance.  Where a regulatory breach occurs, the Commission's approach is to use 'persuasion' to assist services to meet requirements, once the welfare and safety of residents is not compromised.  However, the Commission will escalate its actions when notified of a serious concern by the Inspector of Mental Health Services.  In response to non-compliance with the regulations the Commission may request a service to provide a regulatory compliance report or attend a regulatory compliance meeting.  In some circumstances services are required to conduct audits on foot of issues raised in inspection reports. To date, there have been no prosecutions recommended or initiated by the Mental Health Commission under Part Two or Part Five of the Mental Health Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was published in March 2015. During the course of its deliberations, the Expert Group discussed the powers and responsibilities of the Mental Health Commission and the Inspector of Mental Health Services and accordingly has made a number of recommendations in this regard. These recommendations include (i) statutory responsibility for standards in mental health services should be explicitly referenced in a revised section 33 of the Act which specifies the functions of the Mental Health Commission; (ii) a revision to the Act to ensure that there is compliance by approved centres with all codes of practice prepared by the Commission, including the standards in mental health services; and (iii) an amendment to the Act requiring the Inspector to visit a centre and provide a report to the Commission regarding the suitability for registration prior to it being entered into the register of approved centres.</p>  <p>  I have instructed my officials to draw up a general scheme of a bill to reflect all of the recommendations of the Expert Group.</p></reply>

Its principles lie in being physician led, patient focused, shared decision making, evidence based and multiprofessional.</p><p>As part of the Patient Safety First Initiative I appointed the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) to prioritise and quality assure to the level of international methodological standards a suite of National Clinical Guidelines to direct clinical practice decisions for key areas of clinical practice. Clinical guidelines are internationally recognised methods for defining healthcare interventions, improving the effectiveness of care and treatment and reducing variation in care delivery based on the <i>best available evidence</i>. This is a quality improvement approach which promotes cost-effective healthcare that is evidence-based, with subsequent improved clinical decision making and clinical outcomes. Both the NCEC and guideline development groups involve patients and the public in the guideline process.</p><p>NCEC National Clinical Guidelines endorsed by the Minister for Health are mandated for implementation in the Irish health system. Six NCEC National Clinical Guidelines have been published to date: <i>National Early Warning Score </i>(February 2013)<i>, Prevention and Control of MRSA </i>(December 2013), <i>Surveillance, Diagnosis and Management of Clostridium Difficile Infection in Ireland </i>(June 2014), <i>Sepsis Management </i>(November 2014), <i>Maternity Early Warning System </i>(November 2014) and <i>Clinical Handover in Maternity Services</i>(November 2014).</p><p>The NCEC Sepsis Management Guideline has received international recognition and is accredited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).</p><p>In addition the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertakes health technology assessments (HTA) appropriate to decision makers&rsquo; needs to inform national policy and service decisions and National Clinical Guidelines. HTAs are a form of research which evaluates the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies such as drugs, equipment, diagnostic techniques and health promotion activities.  HIQA has published HTA recommendations on treatment thresholds for a number of procedures including gallstone disease and surgeries such as tonsillectomies and cataracts.</p><p>Recommendations based on evidence are made for clinical practice both by NCEC, HIQA and the HSE. For example the decision for targeted rather than universal MRSA screening in Irish hospitals was based on a cost-effective analysis published in the National Clinical Guideline on the <i>Prevention and Control of MRSA </i>(December 2013). The national antibiotic campaign was launched to raise awareness on the correct use of antibiotics. The key message of this campaign is that antibiotics are wasted on viral illnesses, such as colds and flu, and are of no benefit to those suffering from them.</p><p>I will continue to examine new ways that we can drive forward the agenda for increasing the use of evidence for clinical decision making including participation in international campaigns such as 'Choosing Wisely'.</p></reply>

Chairpersons are in place for six hospital groups.  The Saolta Group Chair role is being filled on an interim basis by an existing Board member pending appointment of a new Chair.  Board members have been appointed to three out of seven hospital groups (Saolta, UL Hospitals Group and Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) and it is expected that Board members for the remaining groups will be in place shortly.  Group CEOs have been appointed (with an interim CEO in Saolta Group) and considerable progress has been made in putting Group management teams in place.  Specifically, the RCSI Hospitals core management team, which comprises a Chief Operating Officer, a Director of Nursing, a Clinical Director and a Chief Finance Officer is now in place.</p>  <p>  My priority for 2015 is to get all the Hospital Groups up and running as single cohesive entities before then moving towards developing the appropriate underlying legislation as part of the wider structural reforms.  A key step in this regard will be the development of Hospital Group Strategic Plans.  The Strategic Advisory Group, established to provide objective advice and expertise on the implementation of Hospital Groups, is currently finalising a guidance paper on developing the strategic plans.  This guidance will ensure a coherent approach nationally and will be provided to the Hospital Group Chairs to inform and assist them in developing their strategic plans.  I understand that the Systems Reform Division in the HSE has also been engaging with the Group Chairs and Group CEOs and will be providing them with assistance in the development of their plans.</p>  <p>  Essentially, in developing their plans, Hospital Groups will be expected to demonstrate a co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of services within and across the hospital groups, with an increased focus on small hospitals managing routine urgent or planned care locally and more complex care managed in the larger hospitals and appropriate deployment of staff is key to achieving this.  Hospital Groups are subject to the Employment Control Framework and Public Service Pay Policy in respect of staff numbers, pay, terms, conditions and other relevant matters. However, as part of the drive to empower management, encourage innovation and ensure autonomy with real accountability, it is intended that the HSE will devolve authority to the Hospital Groups to recruit and deploy staff across the Group.</p></reply>

Anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled, subject to certain charges, to receive public in-patient and out-patient hospital services. People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and healthy, whereas in other health insurance systems the level of risk than an individual presents directly affects the premium paid. Under community rating, premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. In effect, older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have supported the older generation when they were younger and can reasonably expect to benefit in a similar way as they themselves now become older.</p>  <p>  When an individual takes out health insurance for the first time in this country, they may have to serve waiting periods before they are fully covered, but accident and injury will be covered immediately.  The application of waiting periods helps to support community rating and is an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community-rated system.</p>  <p>  In the same way, a person who previously lived abroad who becomes resident in Ireland is subject to waiting periods when taking out health insurance for the first time in this country.

This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.</p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service is a national service funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplementing existing services provided by Primary Care.  Within the specialist secondary care mental health service counselling and psychotherapy is provided within community mental health teams when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention and is provided by a health professional on the team.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service and HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House and Console to provide support across a range of needs.</p>  <p>  The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit.  In the first instance however, the HSE Mental Health Division must ensure that the funding currently allocated to CIPC is being used to best effect, to deliver the best outcomes. In this regard, I note the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan for 2015 to &ldquo;Reviewing and improving access to psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic interventions in conjunction with the Primary Care Division&rdquo; as a first step to further consolidate and direct counselling services generally.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific information requested by the Deputy, as this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.

These Clinical Nurse Specialists in psychiatry work in Emergency Departments to provide a more rapid response to those who present with episodes of self-harm. Twenty four of the thirty five nurses approved for this programme have been recruited and are deployed in a number of hospitals. Each nurse is trained in the biopsychosocial assessment of people who self-harm and following such an assessment a care plan is drawn up involving the person and their next of kin (if they consent). Each person is offered whatever support and care is clinically appropriate thereafter. This might include referral to a voluntary agency specialising in the care of people with suicidal ideation or self-harm, referral to the primary care psychology services and or to the local Community Mental Health Team. As part of this Programme, clinical activity is being collected and it is hoped that if this intervention has a good outcome it may be possible to extend the hours and days of working to ensure a more comprehensive response within Emergency Departments.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of an outreach programme operated by the hospitals in Cork, as this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The readiness and compatibility of the professions for designation under the 2005 Act also need to be determined.</p>  <p>  The Council's detailed report on the matter has now been received and is being carefully examined in the Department. The matter remains at an early stage of consideration and consultation with industry professionals and other stakeholders will be considered in due course.</p>  <p>  This answer should in some way go towards clarifying the question for the Deputy</p></reply>

The aim is to reduce alcohol consumption to the OECD average by 2020 (i.e. 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita) and the harms caused by alcohol.  The Bill is part of a suite of measures agreed by the Government in 2013 on foot of the recommendations in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  The other measures (eg for the HSE, professional bodies etc) set out in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant departments and organisations.  The HSE has responsibility for implementing a number of recommendations and some of these measures are reflected in the HSE Service Plan for 2015.  The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse last year, in view of the key they play in co-ordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.</p></reply>

A seventh, the Social Care Workers Registration Board, was recently set up and its inaugural meeting took place on 25 May 2015.  The eighth, the Optical Registration Board, was established earlier this year to regulate the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician.  These optical professions, currently regulated under the Opticians Act 1956, will be regulated later this year under the 2005 Act on foot of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  This implements a Government Decision on the rationalisation of State Agencies and brings to 14 the number of professions designated for regulation by the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.   </p>  <p>  Registration boards are yet to be established for the remaining five designated professions of clinical biochemist, medical scientist, orthoptist, podiatrist and psychologist.

This will result in the discontinuation of undifferentiated surgical cases that present at the hospital's Emergency Department.</p>  <p>  This work is being done to strengthen services in Portlaoise Hospital from a patient safety and quality perspective and to ensure that services currently provided by the hospital that are not viable are discontinued and that services that are viable, are safe and adequately resourced. This is also in keeping with the recommendations of the HIQA Report into services at the hospital.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to securing and further developing the role of Portlaoise Hospital as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Any change to its services will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  The HSE has made it clear that maternity, acute medical and paediatric services will continue, and that elective day surgery is likely to be expanded.  Patient safety and outcome must come first and following concerns raised by HIQA over the potentially unsafe low volume of complex operations carried out at the hospital, the Hospital Group has decided to move complex surgery to bigger centres. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these changes will improve services for patients at Portlaoise Hospital.</p></reply>

The overriding principle is that human health is well protected and accounted for in the development of all EU policies and activities.</p>  <p>  The Treaty also makes clear that the EU shall fully respect the responsibility of individual Member States to define their health policies and organise and deliver their health services and medical care, including any resources assigned to them.</p>  <p>  The EU mostly complements and supports the work that goes on in individual Member States on issues where coordination cooperation and exchange of information, knowledge and best practice is the best way forward.  For example, under the EU Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), the Patient Safety and Quality of Care Expert Group supports and guides Member States in developing their respective patient safety agendas, including the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections.  The Group, which also comprises relevant stakeholders (professional associations at European level and interested agencies) is working to develop a framework for a sustainable EU collaboration on patient safety and quality of care in order to advance the overall patient safety agenda.  It also supports a Patient Safety Joint Action initiative which has worked across Member States to develop practical work packages to support healthcare across the Community.</p></reply>

The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE's Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million will also be made to support the development of therapy services in 2015 (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year).  The transition to this new service model is taking place on a phased basis and includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, including service users and their families.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in respect of the detailed operational issues that he has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

We are preparing for three interlinked international conferences: in Addis Ababa in July on financing for development, in New York in September on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals, and in Paris in December on a new climate treaty.</p><p>I will lead the Irish delegation to the conference in Addis Ababa, the outcome of which will be essential for success in the subsequent conferences.Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.  The contours of agreement at Addis Ababa will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the major Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  It will be important, then, that all<i></i>parties contribute on an equitable basis and that we also look at measures to unlock all available sources of financing.  These measures must include domestic resource mobilisation, the most rapidly growing component of development finance over the last decade, as well as exploring ways of involving the private sector as inclusive partners in development and recognising the importance of science and technology.</p><p>While ODA will not be sole focus of negotiations at Addis Ababa, it remains particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries, including many African countries and fragile states, countries which are the focus of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. The Government remains firmly committed to reaching the 0.7% target and to making further progress towards it as our economic recovery consolidates.  Ireland therefore welcomed the reconfirmation of the EU&rsquo;s collective commitment to reaching the 0.7% target within the timeframe of the post-2015 agenda when Development Ministers met at the Council meeting which I attended in Brussels on 26 May.  We also agreed on the need to direct more aid to the Least Developed Countries, and especially to the poorest African countries.  Ireland is a world leader in the proportion of our aid which we provide to the poorest countries.  Ireland is committed to working with our EU and UN partners to secure an inclusive agreement at Addis Ababa that will support the new, transformative Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

Over 800 million people are estimated to be hungry in the world and under-nutrition is the biggest underlying cause of death in children under the age of five, causing 8,000 child deaths each day.  The eradication of hunger and malnutrition is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme and central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy values.  Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment is set out in our Policy for International Development, "One World, One Future" and in our Foreign Policy document "The Global Island".  Overall, 20% of the development budget managed by Irish Aid is directed to the fight against hunger and under-nutrition, including through promotion of smallholder agricultural production and support for women&rsquo;s empowerment.  We focus particularly on the challenge of improving maternal and child nutrition in the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.  Ireland is committed to increasing political will and investment to address under-nutrition in developing countries, and we have developed a strong and active partnership on this challenge with the United Kingdom. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the UK work closely in our support for the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement which seeks to improve maternal, infant and child nutrition. </p>  <p>  During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union in 2013, the UK supported Ireland&rsquo;s initiative to highlight the linked challenges of hunger, malnutrition and climate change.  In turn, Ireland was a core partner on the UK&rsquo;s G8 Presidency "Nutrition for Growth" event in London in June 2013.  My officials worked closely with their British counterparts to help secure ambitious policy and financing commitments from high level participants to tackle under-nutrition.  During this London meeting, the Taoiseach pledged that Ireland will double its expenditure on nutrition by 2020, and we are on track to fulfil this commitment. </p>  <p>  In this important year for international development, my Department is collaborating closely with the UK, in our role in co-facilitating, with the Government of Kenya, the process at the UN for the development of Sustainable Development Goals.  These negotiations will deliver a new global framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals, with the goal of ending extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.  We will continue our close partnership with the UK on advancing this shared and critical objective.</p></reply>

This was the first official visit by the UN Secretary General since 2009 and it coincided with the launch of a programme of events to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the UN.  The visit provided an opportunity to showcase our unique contribution to the UN over the past 60 years.  After receiving the Tipperary International Peace Award on Sunday, the Secretary-General visited the Curragh for events to mark Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to UN Peacekeeping.  He then participated in a private lunch hosted by President Higgins before meeting resettled refugees and Syrians living in Ireland.  He delivered a keynote Iveagh House Commemorative Lecture on Monday, 25 May in Dublin Castle before attending a dinner hosted by the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the Government in Farmleigh.  On Tuesday, 26 May, the Secretary-General met the Taoiseach, and his visit concluded with a youth event in Iveagh House.</p>  <p>  On Monday, 25 May, accompanied by officials from my Department, I had a bilateral meeting with the Secretary-General and members of his delegation at Dublin Castle.  We reflected on the happy coincidence that the 60th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s membership coincides with the 70th anniversary of the UN&rsquo;s existence.  I reminded the Secretary-General that in line with Ireland's proud history of UN engagement we would campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2020.  We agreed that, significant anniversaries notwithstanding, 2015 is a crucial year for the United Nations.  The International Conference on Financing for Development takes place in Addis Ababa in July, key climate change negotiations take place in December in Paris and Ireland is co-facilitating ongoing negotiations in New York on a set of Sustainable Development Goals which will be adopted at a summit in September to replace the Millennium Development Goals.</p>  <p>  We also discussed human rights, including Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council for the 2013-15 term.  I expressed my serious concern at the increasing persecution of religious minorities, including Christians, particularly in the Middle East, and underlined Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief.  I also stated my concern at the growing restrictions on civil society space and reprisals against human rights defenders in many countries around the world, which Ireland has been active in highlighting at the UN and EU levels.  Finally, I noted our commitment to continue leading our national initiatives on civil society space and preventable under-five mortality at the Human Rights Council after our membership ends in December 2015.  We discussed the Middle East Peace Process and I shared with the Secretary-General my deep concern at the continued expansion of settlements and how damaging this is for the peace process.  I asked that he continue to do what he can to ensure both sides retain the confidence of the UN.</p></reply>

The scale and presence of the network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis.  Any decision to adjust the State&rsquo;s external representation, including the opening of missions, will have regard to national priorities and available financial and staffing resources.  Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Wales continues to be developed bilaterally through the Embassy of Ireland in London, through the British Irish Council and through co-operation on EU programmes.  Visits at official and political level take place on a regular basis, including visits to Wales by both President Higgins and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, during the last nine months. Ireland will also host the next summit of the British Irish Council in Dublin later this month, when we will welcome the leadership of the Welsh Government along with other British Irish Council member administrations.  There are no plans under immediate consideration for the re-opening of a Consulate General in Cardiff and so the question of the estimated cost of such a proposal does not at present arise.</p></reply>

In the course of his meetings there in November 2014, he met with a senior Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative and raised this case, noting that it is a matter of grave concern in Ireland.  Officials in my Department have also raised this case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.  On 18 October 2014, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed deep concern and sadness at the High Court decision to uphold this conviction.  They also called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party.  The death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the then EU High Representative Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October 2014.  In the course of this, it was noted that the EU, particularly its delegation in Islamabad, would continue to both follow the case closely and to advocate for the verdict to be overturned.  While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.</p>  <p>  The current EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis, also visited Pakistan in October 2014 where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.</p>  <p>  Freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.  In recent months, the EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were successfully adopted without a vote by the Human Rights Council in March 2015 and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session in December 2014.  Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these resolutions.  I raised concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief when I addressed the Human Rights Council in March.</p>  <p>  We are aware of the vulnerable situation of persons belonging to religious minorities in Pakistan and will continue to raise this case and others bilaterally with the Pakistan Government as well as through the framework and mechanisms of the EU and the UN.</p></reply>

This issue was discussed in April by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and I have taken note of the views expressed by the Committee&rsquo;s members.</p>  <p>  The centenary commemorations have raised global awareness of the intense suffering endured by Armenians in the Ottoman Empire during that time.  In April, President Higgins conveyed to President Sargsyan of Armenia the sympathy of the Irish people for the suffering of the Armenian people. Ireland&rsquo;s sympathy was also expressed by our Ambassador, John Biggar, through his attendance at the official centenary commemorative event in Yerevan.</p>  <p>  In the spirit which has guided Ireland&rsquo;s own centenary commemorations, I wish to reiterate the hope I expressed in my earlier replies, that both Armenia and Turkey would avail of any opportunity to advance reconciliation between their two peoples for the benefit of both countries and of the wider region.</p></reply>

This is clearly articulated in both &lsquo;The Global Island - Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rsquo;, and in our policy on International Development, &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo;.  We have reaffirmed our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), and to making further progress towards it when economic circumstances permit.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years, in the context of severe economic difficulty, we successfully managed to stabilise allocations to the aid programme.  I believe this to have been a major achievement for the Government.  For 2015, we have again protected overall allocations to the aid programme, and provided a total of just over &euro;600 million for ODA.</p>  <p>  Last month, at the meeting of EU Development Ministers in the Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Brussels, the EU recommitted to providing 0.7% of collective GNP in Official Development Assistance.  At the meeting, Ireland played a strong role in helping broker the agreement to achieve the target within the timeframe of the post-2015 development agenda.</p>  <p>  As our economic recovery continues to consolidate and strengthen, the challenge now is to determine how best we can make sustainable progress towards the UN target, as we continue to build on Ireland&rsquo;s world-class aid programme by ensuring we make an effective contribution to the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger. I will be making the strongest possible case for an increase in the budget for the aid programme for 2016. </p></reply>

We are preparing for three interlinked international conferences:  in Addis in July on financing for development, in New York in September on a new set of Sustainable Development Goals and in Paris in December on a new climate treaty.  The outcome of Addis will be essential for success in the subsequent conferences.  Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, post-2015.</p>  <p>  The contours of a successful agreement at Addis will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the major Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  It will be important to ensure that all countries contribute on an equitable basis and that the Conference can agree on measures to unlock all available sources of financing for development. These will need to include domestic resource mobilisation, the most rapidly growing component of development finance over the last decade, as well as ways of involving the private sector as inclusive partners in development and recognising the importance of science and technology.</p>  <p>  While ODA will not be sole focus of negotiations at Addis, it remains particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries, including many African countries and fragile states, countries which are the focus of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  The Government remains firmly committed to reaching the 0.7% target and to making further progress towards it as our economic recovery consolidates.  At the meeting of EU Development Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Brussels on 26 May, agreement was reached to reconfirm the EU&rsquo;s collective commitment to reaching the 0.7% target within the timeframe of the post 2015 agenda.  We also agreed on the need to direct more aid to the Least Developed Countries, and especially to the poorest African countries. Ireland is a world leader in the proportion of our aid which we provide to the poorest countries.</p>  <p>  I look forward to attending the Conference in Addis Ababa and to working with our EU and UN partners to secure an inclusive agreement that will support the new, transformative Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

The Conferences are interlinked.  They are on Financing for Development, in Addis Ababa in July, on a new framework for global development at the UN in New York in September and on a new climate change agreement in Paris in December.  The aim is to deliver a new and transformative sustainable development agenda for the period up to 2030, with Sustainable Development Goals to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) after 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland is co-facilitating intergovernmental negotiations at the United Nations to agree the new SDGs which will complete the work of the MDGs on the eradication of extreme poverty and will also place sustainable development at the core.  The SDGs will be universal in nature and address development challenges through social, environmental and economic actions in low, middle and high-income countries alike.  They will address a wide range of areas including MDG priorities such as food and nutrition, but also broader challenges, including on climate, sustainable production and consumption, trade and global governance structures, and peace and governance.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities for the post-2015 Development Agenda have been the fight to end hunger and under-nutrition, gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, and good governance and rule of law.  These priorities are drawn from Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development &lsquo;One World, One Future&rsquo; and the priorities set out following the Foreign Policy Review in &lsquo;The Global Island&rsquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s positions in the UN negotiations and in the relevant EU coordination are agreed through a whole-of-Government coordination process involving all relevant Government Departments.  We have advocated for strong goals and targets in each of these key areas, and we have emphasised the need to incorporate human rights in the new development framework, reduce global inequality and protect the role of civil society. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the inter-governmental negotiations on the SDGs which are being co-facilitated by Ireland and Kenya will agree an ambitious outcome which will be adopted by a Summit of world leaders in September in New York.  Ireland is committed to playing an active and constructive role with our EU and UN partners in reaching agreement on these new, transformative goals.</p></reply>

We are committed to identifying specific policy areas where policy coherence for development can be enhanced.  The OECD Peer Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Development Cooperation Programme last year noted the considerable progress already made in this regard.  It also recommended that Ireland develop a more strategic approach and focus on a few policy issues where greater coherence is required.</p><p>Since the publication of <i>One World One Future</i>in 2013, we have made progress in advancing coherence in a number of policy areas, including on taxation and support for developing countries to raise their own domestic revenue for use in their development.  Climate change, energy and agriculture are also areas on which we have focused strongly.  They have a critical relationship with global food and nutrition security and hunger, and are priority areas for our development programmes.  Through Irish Aid support on climate change and development, we have assisted Least Developed Countries to engage in the international climate change negotiations.  On a practical level, we are supporting efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation in Ireland&rsquo;s Key Partner Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  We are working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through collaboration in the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture, and through joint support for and engagement in the Leadership Forum for Climate Smart Agriculture hosted by the RDS and the Institute for International and European Affairs.</p><p>My Department engages fully in cross-Government consultation on these issues.  We work closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which leads on the issue of climate change nationally and internationally, and officials from my Department form part of Ireland&rsquo;s national delegation to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>In line with a whole-of-Government approach to national, European and international climate policy development, my Department participates in the Senior Officials Group on Economic Infrastructure and Climate Change, along with officials from other relevant Government Departments, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Energy, Communications and Natural Resources, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine.  This group supports the Cabinet Committee on Economic Infrastructure and Climate Change which is chaired by An Taoiseach and in which I have participated.</p><p>I would note that the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, which was approved by Government, recognises that the need to ensure a coherent and cost-effective approach to the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector, is a key issue for consideration in the on-going evolution of national climate policy.</p><p>Officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture are in regular contact on a bilateral basis, including on AgriFood 2025.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources takes the lead on Government policy in relation to biofuels including renewable and bio-energy policy.  My Department has contributed to the development of policy on bio-energy in Ireland through inputs to the draft National Bio-energy Plan drawn up by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  My Department will continue to contribute to the development of the National Bio-energy Plan through the consultation process leading to the finalisation of the National Plan.</p><p>The new Sustainable Development Goals due to be adopted at the UN Summit in New York in September will represent a comprehensive and far-reaching set of universal goals and targets which will transform for the better the world in which we live.  The success of the new development agenda hinges on coherence at domestic and international level to ensure policies are focused on poverty eradication and sustainable development.  The Interdepartmental Committee on International Development (IDCD) has recently focused on preparations for the UN negotiations on the new development framework.  For this purpose, the IDCD has been co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure a comprehensive and coherent Irish position on Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the inter-governmental negotiations which are taking place in New York.  It has met five times since December last year, including with representatives from civil society.  The IDCD will continue to meet on a regular basis in this format until September.</p><p>It is my intention, following the UN Summit in New York in September, to review how the IDCD is structured and to ensure it is well placed to deliver on our commitment to policy coherence for development.  I will work with the members of the Oireachtas to identify the areas where Ireland can most effectively make a difference in advancing areas of policy coherence related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, building on the achievements to date.</p></reply>

The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a report 'A study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs' which is available at www.ncse.ie and which contains details regarding the prevalence of special needs among the pupil population including noting gender differentials. </p>  <p>  The recently published NCSE Report Delivery for Students with Special Educational Needs, which is also available at www.ncse.ie, recommended that a new resource teaching allocation model be devised for schools taking into account the profiled need of schools and the educational profile of a school. </p>  <p>  In doing so, the NCSE report recommended that gender should continue to be a factor in deciding on school profile for resource allocation purposes.</p>  <p>  Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, there has not been sufficient time to address all of the concerns which have been raised in advance of the 2015 school year. </p>  <p>  My Department is, however, continuing to develop the new allocation model for schools and is currently working to devise a pilot of the new model. In developing the new allocation model for schools, my Department will take account of the recommendations of the NCSE policy advice in relation to the inclusion of gender in deciding on school profiles for resource allocation purposes.</p></reply>

These type of defects can occur on any kind of road vehicle in normal day to day operations.

The payment was reduced as part of Budget 2011 and as part of Budget 2014 it was decided to cease this payment for all participants commencing courses after 1st January 2014.

The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015.</p>  <p>  This funding will be used to provide 1,700 additional teachers and SNAs for our schools, as well as to fund prioritised reforms, such as implementation of the literacy and numeracy strategy, reform of junior cycle, and the introduction of education focussed pre-school inspections.  The improvements in the Primary Staffing Schedule for small schools which I announced in February last are the only changes that I will be making to the staffing arrangements for schools for the 2015/16 school year.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth.

Principal duties in small to medium sized schools are carried out by teaching principals. </p>  <p>  Circular 25/02 which is available on the Department website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school.  The cost of doubling this release time would be of the order of &euro;10m per annum. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals-teachers.  My Department has done work in helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals.  The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.  A further step forward was the publication recently of Department Circular 0033/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database.</p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.  They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. </p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Minimums and maximums apply to these grants which reflect the estimated minimum running costs of small schools and the economies of scale that may be achieved in larger schools.</p><p>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs.  These classes have a lower Pupil Teacher ratio and as such the unit cost per pupil is higher.</p><p>It is extremely difficult to make valid comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post primary levels.  However it is accepted that the maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools and this forms the basis for the difference in per capita funding.  In general, second level schools have a lower pupil teacher ratio, resulting in more classrooms and this would lead to higher per unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p><p>In addition the second level capitation is required to cover a different range of expenditures.  Second level schools provide a broader curriculum, including technical subjects where the costs of materials may be greater than at primary level. In addition, specialist equipment and rooms are required for some subjects, leading to higher maintenance/replacement costs.</p><p>I am determined that education will be prioritised for further investment in future years, and I believe that increasing the staffing and funding of our schools should be priorities for such investment.</p></reply>

While the research is useful it is important to note that the survey did not include a school management perspective or encompass the role of other teachers in schools given that guidance provision is a whole school activity.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p>  <p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources. </p>  <p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. </p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on "wellbeing" being studied by all pupils. </p></reply>

Those who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2015/16 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. </p>  <p>  Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation, inter alia, to progression.  The progression requirement provides that a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another, where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.</p></reply>

Independent students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to their parents' incomes.  The assessment as an independent mature student has to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period of time before commencing their studies.

The options are that he may appeal to the High Court on a point of law under Section 21(6) of the Student Support Act 2011 and under the Ombudsman Acts 1980 to 2012.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Under the Equal Status Act schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act. However, the Act makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. </p><p>The legislation provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p><p>Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</p><p>The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-8738700.</p><p>I published the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in early April. The Bill is on the Government's legislative programme for enactment in this session. </p><p>The Bill provides an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p><p>The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation. </p><p>  The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

These projections are published on the website. My Department is in the process of updating its estimate of the impact of demographics on expenditure on the Education and Skills Vote, to take account of most recent  projections of pupil numbers over the years ahead. It is planned that this exercise will be completed shortly. </p><p>However, earlier indicative figures of the cost of providing for demographics were set out in an analytical paper compiled by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of Budget 2013. The link to this paper is at the following address: . </p><p>This paper calculated the impact of demographics in terms of teacher numbers in schools and of the cost of capitation grant payments. It estimated additional costs in this regard of some &euro;207 million arising between 2016 and 2021. In addition to these costs, there would also be impacts on other areas such as special needs expenditure, school transport and student grants. Demographic pressures will also create pressures on school accommodation and consequent pressure for capital investment. Much, however, will depend in this regard on the location and distribution of the additional pupil numbers. </p><p>In November 2011 under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework a total over &euro;2.2 billion was allocated to the Education sector of which over &euro;2 billion was assigned to the schools sector (Primary and Post-Primary). Within the school sector allocation &euro;1.5 billion is assigned to the delivery of large scale projects.</p><p>Details were announced in March 2012 of 275 major school building projects to commence over a five year period. These major projects include 106 new schools and 65 large scale extensions at primary level. In addition to large scale projects, permanent classrooms are provided under the devolved Additional Accommodation and Prefab Replacement Schemes where smaller sized projects are capable of addressing increased enrolment numbers.</p><p>Under the Capital Review 2016-2020, the Department presented its submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in July 2014 and awaits the determination of that Department. The enrolment projections at primary level in the submission indicate that numbers will continue to rise until reaching a peak in 2018/19.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. </p>  <p>  Once allocated, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  All schools have been asked to apply to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March, 2015. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA support which have been made by schools and all schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be advised of their revised SNA allocations for the 2015/16 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

Indeed, by creating institutions of greater scale and strength, high quality multi-campus technological universities will be able to bring greater social and economic benefits to their respective regions. </p>  <p>  The Technological University Bill, when published, will reflect technological universities' multi-campus nature and their regional focus.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, Head 69 of the General Scheme provides technological universities with the power to determine and charge fees.  However, this is exactly the same power which is provided to universities under the Universities Act 1997 and the wording of Head 69 is based on the wording of the relevant provisions of that Act.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while Universities have the authority under legislation to set their own fees, the Department of Education and Skills can only provide grant in lieu of tuition fee funding based on fee level increases agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and this would, therefore, also be the case for technological universities.  No increases in fee levels have been approved in recent years.</p>  <p>  With regard to the concerns of the staff of IT Tralee, good communication between the leadership of any institute of technology entering into a merger and the staff and students of that higher education institution is extremely important so that a shared vision and understanding of the new institution can be developed.  That message has been conveyed by the HEA and by my Department from the outset.</p></reply>

Circular 25/02 which is available on the Department website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals teachers.  My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals.  The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.  A further step forward was the recent publication of Department Circular 0033/2015 which updates and simplifies the manner in which primary schools can maintain pupil enrolment and attendance records following the introduction of the primary online database. </p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector.  They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession. </p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

This announcement included a new school for the Drumcondra Marino area, which is within the Dublin Bay North area, although not specifically the area referred to by the Deputy.  A patronage determination process is expected to take place before the end of this year to establish who will be awarded patronage of this school, and any applicant patron must show evidence of parental demand from within the area for the school type they propose.  It will be open to all patrons to apply to run this school, including patrons proposing a non-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  My Department currently has no plans to open an additional primary school in the postcode area referred to by the Deputy as there is no current demographic requirement.  It should be noted that my Department continues to review demographic data on an ongoing basis to determine where new primary schools will be needed from 2016 onwards.  All areas, including the area referred to by the Deputy, are included in this review.  Increase in the birth rate since the early 2000s has caused a population boom and this is putting major pressure on school accommodation.  For this reason the Department's capital budget for building new schools has to prioritise meeting demographic need in order to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place.  </p></reply>

These secondments are subject to annual review.  The arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available.</p><p>  The support services have engaged in succession planning as a key strategy in ensuring continued support for teachers and school leaders in implementing national education policy priorities and CPD and which allows for continuity, quality planning and management.</p><p>  A limited alleviation of the application of the five year secondment limit has been agreed.  It is Department policy to apply the alleviation to meet the business needs of each of the support services, for example, where seconded teachers take on leadership roles or have a specialism or expertise where retention is necessary for continuity, quality planning and management. Representations received on the operation of the policy have been considered.</p><p>  The implementation of this policy is a matter for the services concerned and the relevant section of my Department.</p><p>  I am satisfied that appropriate support to facilitate secondees returning to school has been offered to those concerned.</p><p>  The detail of the number of derogated posts for each support service is contained in the table.</p><p><b>RETENTION PROPOSALS FOR EACH SERVICE FOR 2015/16</b><table><tr><th>Service</th><th>Category 1</th><th>Category 2</th><th>Category 3</th><th>Category 4</th><th>EC Director Category</th><th>Totals</th></tr><tr><td>Programme Development Service for Teachers</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>National Induction Programme for Teachers</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Project Maths</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Special Education Support Service</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>National Behaviour Support Service</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Junior Cycle for Teachers</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Education Centre Directors</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>14</td><td>34</td></tr></table></p><p>Category Descriptions: Category 1 - Directors of National Programmes; Category 2 - Deputy Director/National Co-ordinators of National Programmes; Category 3 - Team Leaders and Assistant National Co-ordinators of National Programmes; Category 4 - Regional Development Officers/Advisors of National Programmes; EC Director - Directors of Education Centres.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2014, for their consideration.</p><p>  The NCSE are currently considering all of the applications for support which have been received, including those which have been received after the 18th March, and will advise schools of the outcome of their applications ahead of the new school year.</p><p>  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The feedback from these teachers of English to date makes clear that they have particular CPD needs and that significant adjustments are required to the first Classroom-Based Assessments for English to be completed in Spring 2016.</p><p>  In regard to the group of students currently in first year (in the 2014/15 school year), teachers and schools will have the option of having their students complete the first classroom-based component either in spring of 2016 (in second year) or early in autumn 2016 (in the beginning of third year). In view of the urgency of supporting these teachers in implementing the second year English course in the 2015/16 school year, immediate priority will be given to providing intensive CPD for this subject as well as whole-school CPD for Junior Cycle.</p><p>  The CPD programme for English will be informed by appropriate input from these teachers.</p><p>  The NCCA will specify a wider range of assessment options that will enable English teachers to ensure that the first Classroom-Based Assessment is manageable and appropriate to the learning needs of students&quot;.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.</p><p>  In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options and class sizes within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. </p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.</p><p>  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).</p><p>  The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p><p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth.  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

While the LEADER allocation for the 2014-2020 Programme is less than the value of the LEADER element of 2007 &ndash; 2013 Programme, I am confident that within the confines of the fiscal environment we have experienced in the recent past, the Government has allocated the maximum amount possible to support the LEADER elements of the 2014-2020 programme and in this context it is not proposed to increase the co-financing rate at this time.</p><p>The &euro;250 million funding available, coupled with the Government&rsquo;s drive to increase coordination at a local level and the commitment to the delivery of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA), will ensure that the impact of the funding will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities.  </p><p>Indeed, I recently announced the launch of the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) pilot scheme, one of the most important CEDRA recommendations. A total of &euro;2 million is being made available under this scheme, which I envisage will fund up to 18 pilot projects on a regional and county basis. The pilot scheme is open to all local authorities in cooperation with their relevant REDZ communities. My Department has finalised the scheme criteria and I am encouraging all interested communities to engage with their local authorities with a view to submitting an application.</p><p>Regarding the allocation of funding under the Leader elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, it is the responsibility of the Member State to <i>&ldquo;define criteria for the selection of community led local development strategies&rdquo;</i>.

Retained fire-fighters who opted not to join the scheme receive, on retirement, a gratuity of 1/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer). All retained fire-fighters appointed after 1 January 2013 must join the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 states that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme, or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme, is subject to a deduction from their remuneration. Additional pension benefits do not arise as a result of this deduction.</p>  <p>  The payment of the retirement gratuity to retained firefighters who are not members of the LGSS is a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme and, as such, all retained fire-fighters, whether members of a public service pension scheme or not, are subject to the deduction outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. Responsibility for this legislation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

Some 170 submissions have been received and are currently being considered by my Department. A report on the key concerns raised during the review and the recommended course of action for addressing these concerns will be completed by end June 2015 with a view to ensuring that any changes deemed appropriate will be effected as a matter of priority. </p></reply>

Development of the NMP is being guided by a long-term vision of low-carbon transition which is based on the following ambition as set out in the <i>National Policy Position</i>, published in April 2014: </p><p>- an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors, and</p><p>-  in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p><p>In developing the NMP, it will be important to consider the annual calculations concerned in respect of emissions reductions over the long term and to assess what is the optimum methodology for doing so.  In accordance with the provisions of the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, I must also, together with my colleagues in Government, take account of the need to achieve the objectives of the NMP at the least cost to the national economy and adopt measures that are cost-effective.  The NMP will therefore have a strong focus on mapping out the least-cost pathway to achieve the ambition levels set out in the <i>National Policy Position</i>and our obligations under the EU&rsquo;s 2009 Effort Sharing Decision. </p><p>In this context, during 2013, my Department commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and the Environmental Research Unit of University College Cork (UCC) to provide technical advice and guidance on the development of a low carbon roadmap for Ireland, with the aim of achieving transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy in the period up to and including the year 2050. The UCC/ESRI work focussed on delivering least-cost pathways to two possible interpretations of the long-term transition objective. These were 80% and 95% reductions of the aggregated carbon dioxide emissions for three of the key sectors specified in the National Policy Position, i.e. electricity generation, transport and built environment sectors. This analysis has provided important input to the preparatory work already underway in the context of developing the NMP.</p><p>Delayed emissions reductions are detrimental to the environment as environmental damage must be considered in the context of emissions over time, rather than emissions at a point in time. For this reason, it is imperative that early, cost-effective action is taken and the NMP plan is being developed on this basis in line with provisions in relation to early action set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.</p><p>As a party to the UNFCCC, Ireland fully intends to comply with its international obligations. The <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>is unequivocal on compliance with obligations of the State under existing and future international agreements to which the State becomes a party.</p></reply>

A table listing the 31 monitoring sites and those which measure PM10 and PM2.5 is included below. </p><p>The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant listed below, which includes particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone: sulphur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen; carbon monoxide; ozone; particulate matter &ndash; PM10 and PM2.5; benzene and volatile organic compounds (VOCs); heavy metals &ndash; lead, arsenic, cadmium, nickel and mercury; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); elemental carbon/organic carbon (EC/OC) as part of PM2.5 speciation; and anions and cations as part of PM2.5 speciation.</p><p>Particulate matter is harmful to health and it is accepted among health officials that exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 should be reduced. In cities, traffic emissions are the main source of particulate matter while in smaller towns emissions from domestic solid fuel combustion dominate. The air quality in cities benefits from the ban on smoky coal, as well as the increased use of gas.  The monitoring of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) is carried out at a representative number of monitoring locations in each of the four zones and meets the requirements of the CAFE Directive - it is not necessary to monitor for particulates at all 31 stations.</p><p>In April 2013, the EPA launched Ireland&rsquo;s new Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH). This web-based index, developed in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, Met &Eacute;ireann and my Department, displays the current air quality across Ireland, by means of a coloured scale of 1 &ndash; 10, divided into four bands (good, fair, poor and very poor), with health advice provided for each band. The AQIH is calculated hourly and is represented on a colour- coded map of Ireland, which the public can view at and can easily assess information about current air quality in their area. The pollutants included in the index are: ozone; nitrogen dioxide; sulphur dioxide; PM10; and PM2.5. To coincide with the launch of the Air Quality Index for Health, the EPA also launched a Twitter channel, @EPAAirQuality, through which the public can receive tweets on the status of air quality in their region every day.</p><p>The EPA is currently preparing a draft national ambient air monitoring programme under Section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (as amended), which will provide the basis and options for the continued development and expansion of the national ambient air monitoring network. The development of the national ambient air monitoring programme will include a review of the adequacy of the current network for both determining compliance with European and national standards for air quality and for the provision of information to the public about local air quality. <table><tr><th>Air Quality Monitoring Station </th><th>PM10 </th><th>PM2.5 </th></tr><tr><td>Ennis, Co.

Almost all local authorities have now exited the waste collection market.</p>  <p>  Collection of waste by a private operator is subject to compliance with applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, primarily the Waste Management Act 1996 and conditions attached to each waste collector&rsquo;s collection permit issued under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007.  Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws, and enforcement of waste legislation, a waste collection permit condition or a waste bye-law is a matter for the relevant local authority.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I am specifically precluded under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the Agency or a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. My role as Minister in terms of waste management is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which waste management enforcement authorities work. </p>  <p>  Charging and billing arrangements are a matter for service providers and their customers, subject to consumer protection requirements. However, as part of the introduction of a radical and comprehensive new regulatory framework to reform the regulation of the collection of household waste in 2015, I intend to introduce measures to require collectors to have a customer charter in place and to meet certain minimum standards of customer service, such as specified frequencies of collection, and information to be provided to households. In addition, I will be setting out in law what the minimum content of these customer charters will be, so that standards of service are raised and are consistent. It will also become a statutory requirement for all collectors to operate the &ldquo;pay-by-weight&rdquo; system as a condition of their permit.  </p>  <p>  The regulation of weighing mechanisms used to determine weight-based waste collection charges is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland and queries in this regard should be directed to that body.</p></reply>

Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, including the fact that the vast majority of households have moved away from local authority collection and have engaged private waste collectors on whom it would be difficult to impose any obligation to provide a waiver system, mandated the working group to continue to examine the issue, with a view to submitting a third report to Government in due course.  </p><p>Given that the vast majority of local authorities no longer collect waste and that the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged and services offered vary across the country, it is becoming increasingly apparent that introducing a national waiver scheme in the context of an open market for waste collection would be highly complex. </p></reply>

In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;10 million has been allocated to the cooperation element of the programme.  &euro;15 million has been allocated for the delivery of two agri-food schemes which will be managed jointly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and my Department.  In addition, &euro;5 million is being held in reserve for the purposes of supporting the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) initiative, pending the successful outcome of a Pilot scheme as identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA). </p>  <p>  In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable allocation.  However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county.  It should be noted that the methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county, including those counties referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied, was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the Leader elements of the programme.   </p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  The 2004 Act represented the most significant legislative reform in the private rented sector in over a century.  Prior to this there was little or no security of tenure for tenants and in most tenancies the landlord had a virtual right to terminate the tenancy subject to only 28 days&rsquo; notice.  Under the 2004 Act, a landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances, such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.   </p>  <p>  As the PRTB replaces the Courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes, there are statutory time periods laid down in the Residential Tenancies Act to provide for due process.</p>  <p>  The PRTB received 3,374 applications for dispute resolution in 2014, a 104% increase since 2008 when 1,650 cases were received.  Some 80% of cases are processed or closed within 5 to 6 months.  Only 7% of what are the most difficult cases are taking 9 to 10 months to process.  There are a number of factors that may delay the processing of a case including where adjournment requests are made or where there are difficulties locating a party to the dispute.  </p>  <p>  A telephone mediation service was introduced in late 2013 as an alternative means to address disputes.  Processing times for mediation cases are typically 10 to 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  While there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2013 alone it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the Board will continue to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner.  My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this and other matters. </p></reply>

Pilot schemes were a feature of the 2013 and 2014 Rural Water Programmes in light of the increased grant level for group sewerage schemes which were announced in late 2012.  However, it was decided that, with effect from 1 January 2015, responsibility for the selection and approval of individual scheme proposals for advancement and funding under the increased grant, subject to the overall priorities set by my Department and to the block grant allocations provided, would revert, as had previously been the case, back to the local authorities.  Therefore, no pilot group sewerage schemes were selected by my Department for funding in 2015. </p>  <p>  In 2014 , my Department approved a grant to Clare County Council for a Feasibility Study on the proposed Carrigaholt Group Sewerage Scheme.  That study has now been completed and I understand that it would not be financially viable to design and construct the scheme as proposed and within the general terms and conditions of Group Sewerage Grant Scheme.  The Council has been advised to liaise with Irish Water, who is statutorily responsible for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, on identifying and putting in place appropriate solutions to meeting the needs of the people of Carrigaholt.   </p>  <p>  My Department will be engaging separately with Irish Water on broader issues around rural water and sewerage programmes with a view to ensuring that there is appropriate integration of the Department's Rural Water Programme and Irish Water's Capital Investment Programme so as to fully support rural development and address any environmental issues that may arise.  Such discussions will involve the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and local authority management.   </p></reply>

Selection of treatment systems for inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s plan is carried out by the local authorities using an IT system (which utilises WebGIS information) developed by the EPA.  Householders cannot request inspections of their own treatment systems, nor are inspections under the plan carried out based on third party complaints. </p><p>Local authorities have all appropriate powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement under the Water Services Act 2007 and under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 to protect water quality, public health and the environment from risks posed by failing on-site waste water treatment systems.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action when dealing with pollution incidents and related risks to public health and the environment. </p><p>Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the owner of a premises to ensure that their waste water treatment systems are kept so as not to cause, or be likely to cause, a risk to human health or the environment, including waters, the atmosphere, land, soil, plants or animals, or create a nuisance through odours.  The duty of care provisions have been augmented by the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 and associated regulations.  Any person whose treatment system fails an inspection or, in the absence of an inspection, considers that their treatment system constitutes, or may constitute, a risk to human health or the environment is responsible for having any necessary remediation works carried out without delay.</p><p>The Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, brought into operation a grants scheme to assist with the cost of remediation of septic tanks and domestic waste water treatment systems which are deemed, following inspection under the EPA&rsquo;s National Inspection Plan and the subsequent issue of an Advisory Notice by the local authority, to require repair or upgrading.  The qualification criteria are set out in the legislation and full details of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, are set out in the explanatory leaflet and application form published on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>I have no plans to extend or vary the qualifying criteria of the grant scheme.  However, householders who do not meet the eligibility criteria included in the Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2013 but wish to remediate or upgrade their on-site treatment systems may qualify for relief under the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) Scheme introduced under Section 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  The HRI scheme covers main residence repairs, renovations and improvements, including the repair or replacement of septic tanks.  The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and full details are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: . </p></reply>

Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).  Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building or works.Part E (Sound) of the Building Regulations 1997 sets out the legal requirements in relation to sound insulation in attached dwellings and apartment blocks and sets out requirements for certain constructions to offer &ldquo;reasonable resistance&rdquo; to both airborne and impact sound.  In this regard, section 3 of the existing Technical Guidance Document E provides guidance on typical floor constructions which, if constructed correctly, should achieve the requirements to have &ldquo;reasonable resistance&rdquo; to both airborne and impact sound.</p><p>A comprehensive review of Part E of the Building Regulations 1997 was completed in December 2014.  The recent and the associated , which come into effect on 1 July 2015, establish enhanced performance standards for attached dwellings, in particular airborne sound insulation of separating walls and both airborne and impact sound insulation of separating floors.  The new measures also provide for mandatory sound testing on a proportion of new attached dwellings.</p><p>While these changes will lead to an improvement in the quality of sound insulation in housing and contribute to greater compliance with the requirements of Part E, in general, the requirements of the Building Regulations do not apply to the furnishing and internal d&eacute;cor of dwellings.  Any new floor covering fitted in an existing dwelling should be installed in accordance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions and due care should be taken not to adversely affect the isolation of the floor covering from the separating floor structure.

The current rate of 2.75% is approximately 1.5% lower than standard variable mortgage rate (saving borrowers &euro;1,500 per annum on a &euro;100,000 loan) and is the lowest rate available currently in the domestic mortgage market.  The Housing Finance Agency (HFA) provides loan finance to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies for housing and related purposes.  The interest rates the Agency must pay are not predicated on base rates afforded by the European Central Bank (ECB) as its funding is sourced through a variety of market sources, including the European Investment Bank.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters and the Valuation Act 2001 comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The national revaluation programme is the first general valuation since the middle of the 19th century and it is a significant undertaking.  The essential purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute the burden of rates more equitably in line with relative changes in valuations across different classes of properties or individual properties within particular classes or uses.  Revaluation results in more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and provides a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.  This may inevitably result in an increase in the valuation of some commercial properties and a decrease in the valuation of others. </p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  As provided for in rating legislation, one ARV is set for each rating authority; there is no provision to allow separate ARVs for different business sectors. </p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Act 1970 provides for the operation of rates waiver schemes.  Under the provisions, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for a waiver of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The formulation of such a scheme is a matter reserved for the members of the relevant local authority and is subject to my consent as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I am not currently in receipt of a request under this provision. </p>  <p>  I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme.  In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on other businesses in the area by giving a competitive advantage to a certain group through a reduction in costs.  As such, it would be necessary to consider State Aid rules in relation to the provision of any such relief.  In addition, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses that are not part of the scheme, as it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost of the waiver scheme through the payment of additional rates.  This could impose an additional burden on such ratepayers. </p></reply>

This further support will be based on current levels of funding to the organisations in question and is being provided through a Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations.  The funding to be provided to each organisation is set out in the table below.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and all groups will be required to apply for funding under the Scheme and meet the criteria required for funding. <table><tr><th>Funding allocated under Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 </th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td><div>53,882 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td><div>41,448 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td><div>41,448 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td><div>58,028 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td><div>37,304 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td><div>62,172 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td><div>16,580 </div></td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td><div>16,580 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td><div>19,066 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td><div>62,172 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td><div>41,448 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td><div>58,028 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td><div>33,158 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td><div>24,868 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td><div>29,014 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td><div>24,868 </div></td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td><div>41,448 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td><div>70,462 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td><div>37,304 </div></td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td><div>37,304 </div></td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td><div>74,606 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td><div>41,448 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td><div>24,868 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td><div>74,606 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td><div>29,014 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td><div>62,172 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td><div>62,172 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td><div>49,738 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td><div>49,738 </div></td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td><div>45,592 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition to providing appropriate day and night time noise limits, of either a lower fixed limit of 45 decibels or a relative fixed limit of 5 decibels over background noise together with a fixed night time limit of 43 decibels, the existing Guidelines also provide for a setback distance from a wind turbine of 500m in this context. </p><p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed &ldquo;draft&rdquo; revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines. </p><p>These draft revisions proposed:</p><p>-  the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p><p>-  a mandatory minimum setback distance of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p><p>-  the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p><p>The proposed noise limit takes account of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s 2009 Night Noise Guidelines for Europe, which recommend s an outdoor limit of 40 decibels for night time noise.</p><p>During the public consultation process on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, my Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public. </p><p>My Department is considering the submissions received in relation to this focused review.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.  A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.  Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p><b></b>I am more than aware of the demands the economic downturn has placed on the commercial and business sector.  My Department has, in recent years, requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 is not directly comparable due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.</p><p>The Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave effect to the reorganisation of local governance structures, set out in the <i>Action Plan for Effective Local Government &ndash; Putting People First.</i>A key objective of the reform programme is to reduce the burden on ratepayers and indeed taxpayers generally, by reducing cost and maximising efficiency.</p><p>The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.  The Act provides for rates harmonisation, to cater for differences between ARVs of towns and counties, to be achieved over a ten year period. </p><p>The Act also provided for the removal of the liability that is placed on new occupiers of properties for up to two years of outstanding rates of the previous occupier.  This is a strong indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to removing any barrier to enterprise development and to support business start-ups and those existing businesses wishing to expand or relocate.</p><p>A relatively low level of analysis has been carried out in respect of the impact of rates on business costs but what has been completed concludes that commercial rates represent a small portion of overall business overheads compared to energy, rents, payroll and other inputs.  The figures vary from sector to sector but the research from Forf&aacute;s, IBEC and local authorities all indicate that commercial rates are, on average, less than 5% of business costs. </p><p>I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

In this context, my Department has agreed to part-fund the refurbishment of four houses on Ballybough Road to provide accommodation for residents who wish to remain in the locality.  This scheme is currently at planning stage, and the City Council has advised that work will commence early in 2016.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services.  The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Under Section 10 funding arrangements, responsibility for assessment and decision-making in relation to the funding of particular services rests with the housing authorities.</p>  <p>  Annual allocations for homelessness are made on a regional basis.  Kildare County Council is the lead authority for the Mid-East Region, which also encompasses Meath and Wicklow.  Under Section 10 of the Housing Act, I recently confirmed a 2015 allocation of &euro;934,267 for the Mid-East Region, which represents an increase of over 15% on the 2014 allocation of &euro;811,275.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of temporary accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  </p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988, it is a matter for the housing authority concerned to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless.  Any person regarded as homeless by a housing authority may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation, which the housing authority may arrange itself or which may be operated by a State-funded service provider, without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment and be approved for social housing supports.  I am not considering any amendment to the existing arrangements which give housing authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may present to them. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for social housing support, a household&rsquo;s long-term housing need and eligibility must be determined by a housing authority through a social housing assessment under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Regulations.  Housing authorities are required to deal with completed applications for support within 12 weeks of receipt or within 6 weeks of receiving additional information but are permitted a further 14 weeks to decide on applications in individual cases.   </p>  <p>  The Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS) is provided through Dublin City Council as a national shared service whereby statutory and non-governmental homelessness service providers throughout the country can avail of the software package without the requirement for costly individual support and licence arrangements and with Dublin City Council providing user support.  PASS records the details of homeless services that are funded through housing authorities under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 and whereby the individuals using such services are defined as homeless under Section 2 of that Act.  The usage of PASS by service providers has been established by housing authorities as a requirement for the provision of State funding in respect of homeless services. </p>  <p>  With regard to funding, I have made an additional &euro;10.5 million available nationally for homeless accommodation and related services in 2015.  This is an increase in funding of approximately 20% over the initial allocation in 2014, bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;55.5 million.  Housing authorities were recently informed of regional funding allocations.  The needs of the various regions will be kept under review on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

In order to provide for the acute social housing need, and to maximise the contribution that Part V can make, it is my intention to issue a statutory Ministerial Policy Directive under section 29 of the Planning and Development Acts following enactment of the Bill, under which the primary focus of Part V will be on social housing delivery.</p><p>Sections 33 and 34 of the Bill will amend the options, contained in section 96 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for the delivery of units within a Part V agreement in order to maximise the transfer of completed housing units.  The transfer of land remains the default option, as is currently the case.  However, the option of providing cash payment in lieu of housing is being removed, as is the option of providing sites or land elsewhere. </p><p>The transfer of completed units on other land, not subject to the planning permission, is also provided for.  This allows social housing units to be delivered in another location, in the event that the development that is the subject of the planning permission does not meet the social housing or mixed tenure needs of the local authority.  Provision is also made for the Part V obligation to be fulfilled by developers through long term leasing of properties and rental accommodation availability agreements.</p><p>As is currently the case, in entering Part V agreements local authorities should have regard to section 96(3)(c) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This requires local authorities to consider, amongst other things:</p><p>- the effective and efficient achievement of the objectives of the local authority's own housing strategy;</p><p>- the best use of resources to ensure an adequate supply of housing and the financial implications of the agreement.</p><p>In essence, local authorities should consider value for money in the making of any agreements.  In this regard, expenditure limits and house purchase cost limits are currently under review.</p><p>The changes to the Part V provisions that are proposed are a key component of the range of delivery mechanisms that will be required to achieve the targets set out in the Government's <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.  Subject to the availability of Oireachtas time, I hope that the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 will be enacted before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a landlord's interest in a dwelling it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected.  While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants.  The tenant continues to enjoy the same security of tenure.  The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses their rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The Act also sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy.  In documentation submitted prior to recent meetings with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank confirmed that they adhere to the legislative framework when dealing with the repossession of buy-to-let properties.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the regulation of financial institutions.  The Residential Tenancies Act is about regulating the landlord/tenant relationship.

Under these conditions, water vapour cools and condenses and the particles act as ice nuclei, leading to the production of ice crystals; these ice crystals are what are visible from the ground as a linear cloud of condensation. </p><p>Depending upon atmospheric conditions, these vapour trails can rapidly dissipate or remain for some time, gradually spreading horizontally into an extensive thin cirrus cloud layer.  Water in the atmosphere commonly evaporates to become water vapour.  As a general rule, the drier the air the more effective this evaporation process will be. Under more humid conditions, there will be less effective evaporation and so contrails will generally last longer in more humid air.  Contrail formation is also influenced by wind speeds, with higher winds disrupting and breaking up contrail formation.</p><p>Contrails do not adversely impact ambient air quality in Ireland. Met &Eacute;ireann advises that there is some evidence that contrails can influence climatology but they have little impact on day-to-day weather.  The purported reason for the former is that the contrails (or consequent cirrus cloud) will trap outgoing long-wave radiation, thus leading to warming in the atmosphere, and that this effect is greater than the reflection of short-wave radiation from the sun.  </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is currently funding a PhD study on contrails and their potential effect on climate as part of its STRIVE research programme.  The study titled <i>Cloud cover and radiation balance changes over Ireland due to aircraft induced contrails</i>is due to be completed later this year.</p></reply>

The Regulation gives priority to twelve strategic trans-European energy corridors and areas (for electricity, gas, oil or thematic areas, such as smart grids or a carbon dioxide network) and provides criteria to identify projects of common interest (PCIs).  To be eligible for EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility financing instrument, a project must first be selected as a PCI by the EU regional groups for inclusion on the Union List.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la itself has no role in determining which projects get placed on the EU list.  The PCI eligibility criteria includes a requirement that projects must be cross-border projects or projects which benefit two or more Member States. </p><p>The Regulation also provides for new, more transparent and accelerated permitting processes for such projects, which should generally not exceed 3.5 years.  Member States are required to appoint a Competent Authority responsible for making the comprehensive permitting decision and to ensure that the decision is made within the time limits specified in the Regulation.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been designated as the Competent Authority in Ireland.  It is a matter for developers to pursue applications under the permit granting process applicable to PCIs with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have no function in this matter.</p><p>The Commission adopted the first EU-wide list of PCIs in October 2013. Of the seven projects relevant to Ireland, two were renewable energy projects.  It is understood from An Bord Plean&aacute;la that to date only one project promoter has initiated the PCI permit granting process.  Documents relating to PCI matters and the permit granting process are available on the website of An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the following link . </p><p>Regulation 347/2013 provides that the list of projects will be updated every two years and the process to adopt the second list of PCIs is expected to be completed before the end of 2015.</p></reply>

On 27 March 2015 EirGrid published a new independently peer reviewed draft Strategy &lsquo;Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow&rsquo;, which allows for the achievement of an optimal balance between the competing demands of publicly consulting on necessary network development, choosing the best emerging technology options for that development, and minimising new build. </p>  <p>  The draft strategy noted the fact that Northern Ireland is likely to need to import more generation from Ireland during times of peak demand in the next decade, in order to balance supply and demand and to maintain security of supply.  Accordingly, the draft strategy found that there remains a clear need for the North South transmission line, and that the existing proposal for a 400kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project.  I understand that EirGrid intends to lodge the planning application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la today (9 June).</p>  <p>  In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a competitive, low carbon energy system, the draft strategy states that investment in the electricity grid within Ireland will need to be complemented by EirGrid exploring opportunities for increased regional interconnection to other countries.  The 260km East West Interconnector, which is a 500 MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link between the electricity transmission grids of Ireland and Great Britain, has been in full commercial operation since May 2013.  EirGrid reports that the interconnector has performed very well to date and that the company&rsquo;s customer base has expanded to include energy traders between the all-island and Great Britain electricity markets.  The East West Interconnector has also opened up the Single Electricity Market (SEM) to enhanced competition, delivering downward pressure on the wholesale market price of electricity. </p>  <p>  There was detailed analysis of the potential for renewable energy trading between Ireland and the UK following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the issue in 2013 between my Department and the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK.  The signing of the MOU represented the first step towards an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on the issue.  However, by April 2014, it had become apparent that, given the economic policy and regulatory complexities involved, and the key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, any potential renewable energy trading could only occur post 2020.  </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .

The remaining 51,180 premises in Co Kerry will be covered by commercial investment or will be the target for the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On 24 November 2014, a public consultation was launched on a national high speed coverage map 2016.  This consultation concluded on 12 February 2015. This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016. </p><p>The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention.  All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.  Last week Eircom announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology.  My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from Eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area.</p><p>I intend publishing a draft Intervention Strategy for public consultation in July.  Following completion of that public consultation I hope to be in a position to move to formal procurement later in the year.  I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take between three and five years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>I would add that stakeholder engagement is central to the delivery of the NBP and as part of the planning phase significant stakeholder engagement has been undertaken by my Department. This includes a number of public consultations including on the published national coverage map referred to above.  The engagement process also included meetings with Local Authorities, Leader Groups, Irish Rural Link, the Western Development Commission and others. In addition, my Department publishes a monthly update on progress in relation to the NBP.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>There is a potential role for communities to aggregate demand for services in their areas and in so doing accelerate the deployment and adoption of such services.  At least one operator has successfully piloted this model with businesses in rural towns.</p><p>The BenefIT Programme, which aims to get more people online, provides Government funding to support community, voluntary &amp;amp; not for profit organisations to provide basic digital literacy training.  Since its introduction in 2008, over 120,000 training places have been availed of and training will be available at over 700 locations across Ireland during 2015. </p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.</p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016.  This map is available at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 and includes Hackballscross, Co Louth. </p><p>The AMBER area shows the target areas for the State intervention.  All premises within the AMBER areas will be included in the State's intervention.  Last week Eircom announced an investment that may address a further 300,000 premises with fibre-to-the-premises technology.  My Department will be rigorously examining the assurances from Eircom in relation to these new plans, which is a requirement for all operators, and will review how this impacts the proposed intervention area. </p><p>More generally I can confirm that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to 43,963 premises to date in Co Louth with a further 1,052 expected to be served over the next 18 months.  The remaining 15,129 premises in Co Louth will be covered by commercial investment or be the target for the proposed State intervention under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>Intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area.  Following a public consultation process on the draft Intervention Strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. </p><p>I expect the physical build of the network to begin in late 2016, and it will take between three and five years to fully complete &ndash; depending on the details of the bid or bids selected. </p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.</p></reply>

It provides the mechanism through which action across Government Departments and Agencies to support the development of offshore renewable electricity generation can be fully coordinated in areas such as environmental monitoring and protection, research and development, consenting procedures, infrastructure requirements and enterprise development.  A steering group, which draws on the support of relevant Government departments and agencies, oversees the implementation of the OREDP via three work streams: (i) Environment, (ii) Infrastructure and (iii) Job Creation. </p>  <p>  Work is focussing on the ongoing development of national ocean energy test facilities in Cork, Galway and Mayo (Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site).  Preparatory work is also underway, building on the SEA for the OREDP, on scoping a more detailed environmental study to map constraints and opportunities and identify suitable areas for offshore renewable developments.  In addition, work is progressing on the development of guidance documents for offshore developers on (i) information to be contained in Environmental Impact Statements and Natura Impact Statements (ii) environmental monitoring requirements and (iii) available data sources, to include a gap analysis. </p>  <p>  A total of &euro; 8.1m in in Exchequer funding has been provided over the two years 2014/2015 to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for the Ocean Energy Programme, which includes the Ocean Energy Prototype Fund.  Over 20 projects have received grant offers from the Prototype Fund since the launch of the OREDP. </p>  <p>  The OREDP identifies export as the route to market for offshore wind. Following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Energy Co-operation with the UK Government in January 2013, a joint programme of work was undertaken to consider how Irish renewable energy resources, offshore and onshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both Ireland and the UK. Economic analysis undertaken by my Department clearly indicates that under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading would deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, and would also be attractive to developers.  However, given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and some key decisions that the UK is not yet in a position to take, delivery by 2020 of renewable energy trading is not a realistic proposition.</p>  <p>  In the context of a European Internal Energy Market, it would appear that greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is likely in the post-2020 scenario.   </p></reply>

In March of this year I announced a 50% increase to the grant support available for solar thermal heating solutions; homeowners can now, therefore, receive a grant of &euro;1,200 for solar thermal heating systems.  Separately, while it is a matter in which I, as Minister, have no statutory function, I am aware that Electric Ireland had been offering a micro-generation feed-in tariff since February 2009.  On the 31st December 2014 the pilot scheme was closed to new customers. </p>  <p>  No other electricity supplier had chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, though they have been invited to do so by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  I am not aware of the reasons for the decision to discontinue the scheme which would have been a commercial matter for Electric Ireland</p>  <p>  My Department is giving further policy consideration to the place of microgeneration in our energy mix.  Analysis of the potential of micro-generation technologies such as small scale wind, solar and small scale hydro, has been carried out for the Department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  It shows that while microgeneration has the technical potential to make a significant contribution to Irish electricity consumption, careful consideration would have to be given to the design of any potential future support scheme to ensure it is cost-effective.  The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will be taken into consideration in preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be finalised in the autumn of this year.</p>  <p>  My Department is also commencing the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity, to be available from 2016 onwards.  A key component of this will be consideration of the available technologies, including microgeneration and solar PV, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required.  The scheme will be subject to State Aid clearance and the initial public consultation on the new scheme will commence shortly.  </p></reply>

While it is a matter in which I have no function, it is important to note that EU Regulation 2009/28/EC requires Member States to give priority dispatch to renewable generation on the electricity grid.  This includes hydro generators, unless the generator concerned has elected to forego priority dispatch and to actively trade in the market.  It is the case that hydro electricity generators who have elected to avail of priority dispatch may have their output reduced under certain circumstances.  In such instances, these hydro generators are compensated for this in the Single Electricity Market (i.e. constraint payments).

To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Ireland currently has approximately 2,600MW of renewable electricity generation of which 2,200MW is wind generation. It is estimated that between 3,500MW and 4,000MW of renewable electricity generation will be required to achieve the target of 40% renewable electricity by 2020. Given that we already have 2,600MW in place, we will need between approximately 900MW and 1,400MW additional generation to meet our 2020 target.   </p>  <p>  Typically, an individual wind farm project is subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) where the wind farm has greater than 5 turbines or a generating capacity greater than 5MW. This means, as part of the planning process, the project proposer must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) examining the impact the particular development, such as a wind farm, will have on the receiving and surrounding environment. The EIA is then carried out by the appropriate competent planning authority on a project specific basis. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is preparing a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, which is to be underpinned by a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment and focusing on requirements out to 2030. The Environmental Report developed to inform the Strategic Environmental Assessment will include areas designated pursuant to the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, and will also assess any effects on the environment including on issues such as biodiversity, population, human health, fauna, flora, soil, water, climatic factors, material assets and cultural heritage and the interrelationship between the above factors. </p>  <p>  The proposed Framework will be completed in early 2016, and will be a high level strategic policy, which is intended for the guidance of persons seeking development consent primarily in relation to large scale renewable electricity projects, as well as for the guidance of planning authorities, statutory authorities and the public. The next stage of public consultation will commence in the coming weeks with the publication of the Draft Strategic Environmental Assessment Scoping Report.</p></reply>

Where the Minister concurs with this assessment, the Minister may award a lease undertaking, which will be subject to an agreed work programme that is aimed at establishing whether or not the discovery is in fact commercial. My Department is currently considering five applications for lease undertakings. The operator of standard exploration licence 1/11, which contains the Barryroe Field, has not applied for a lease undertaking.</p>  <p>  Other than in a case where a declaration of commerciality has been made by the authorisation holder and accepted by me as Minister, it would not be appropriate for me to make specific comment on the petroleum potential of any area that is the subject of an exploration\appraisal authorisation, or an application for such an authorisation.</p>  <p>  Where a commercial discovery has been established the authorisation holder is required to apply for a petroleum lease. Where such application is received, the Minister, if of the opinion that it is in the public interest, may demise such petroleum under specified acreage for such terms, conditions and covenants as considered appropriate. The Minister for Finance is a party to a petroleum lease. Any application for a petroleum lease must include the outline development, financial and marketing plans and outline environmental impact for the exploitation of the discovery based on the applicant's considered likely production profile. There are no such applications on hand in my Department as no oil or gas discovery has been established as being commercial in recent years. </p>  <p>  The fiscal terms that apply to production from a petroleum lease are determined by the date of the award of the initial petroleum exploration authorisation, i.e. a licensing option, or exploration licence. Accordingly, production from a petroleum lease arising from an exploration authorisation granted in 2005 would be subject to the 1992 Fiscal Terms, while the 2007 terms would apply in the case of an exploration authorisation granted in 2011.</p></reply>

Following a public procurement process, Wood Mackenzie, a UK based international advisory services company specialising in the energy, metals and mining sectors, were engaged to advise on the appropriateness of Ireland's oil and gas fiscal terms. </p>  <p>  In undertaking their review Wood Mackenzie sought to take account of the need to strike the necessary balance between attracting the high-risk exploration investment needed to prove the potential of the Irish Offshore and maximising the return to the State from Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources. Wood Mackenzie furnished their Final Report to my predecessor at end May 2014.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by Wood Mackenzie. </p>  <p>  A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that the fiscal terms applying in respect of new petroleum authorisations should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields should commercial discoveries of oil or gas be made at some point in the future.</p>  <p>  To achieve this higher share Wood Mackenzie recommended an increase in the marginal tax take from 40% to 55% (comprising corporation tax and a proposed petroleum production tax). </p>  <p>  In addition Wood Mackenzie recommended that the revised fiscal terms should include a minimum payment (petroleum production tax) at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production.</p>  <p>It is intended to give operational effect to this approach in the Finance Bill 2015 with the revised fiscal terms applying to petroleum authorisations issued after June 2014.</p></reply>

While the North South Transmission Line project (N/S) is outside the IEP's Terms of Reference, the IEP did agree, on foot of a request by my predecessor, to provide an opinion on the compatibility of the methodologies, to be employed on the GL and GW projects with what had already been done on the N/S project up to and including 2 May 2014, being the date that the IEP decided to examine the N/S project.</p>  <p>  Having considered and discussed all of the material, the Panel issued a statement on 1 July 2014, indicating its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what had already been done on the N/S project is compatible with the methodologies being employed on the GW and GL projects.</p>  <p>  On 27 March 2015 EirGrid published a new independently peer reviewed draft Strategy which allows for the achievement of an optimal balance between the competing demands of publicly consulting on necessary network development, choosing the best emerging technology options for that development, and minimising new build. The draft strategy found that there remains a clear need for the North South transmission line, and that the existing proposal for a 400kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project. I understand that EirGrid intends to lodge the planning application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la today (9 June).</p>  <p>  Following submission of any final application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of each of the two projects, a further consultative process will be open to interested parties.

It has been in deficit for a number of years and has failed to meet the Minimum Funding Standard laid down under the Pensions Act. Without an amendment to the Scheme, this deficit is expected to rise to an estimated &euro;75.1m by 2023. </p><p>In order to address the issue, an amendment was agreed between Bord na M&oacute;na and the Scheme Trustees after consultation with the Scheme Members and was approved by the Pensions Authority on 22 April, 2015. Under this amendment 67% of the deficit is addressed by increased company contributions, 26% from member contributions and 7% from delayed investment de-risking. This breakdown of contributions is approximate and subject to changes in investment market conditions during the course of the funding proposal's review, on which the Scheme Actuary's assumptions are based. Member contributions are made via benefit reductions on a progressive scale where pensions up to &euro;12,000 per annum are not reduced, pensions of &euro;12,000 - &euro;60,000 incur a 3.6% cut while pensions above &euro;60,000 incur a 7.2% cut, subject to not being reduced below &euro;57,840. </p><p>The approved changes to the Scheme do not include a pension levy. The levy the Deputy refers to is the general pension levy introduced by the Minister of Finance in 2011 on all<font color="#444444"> </font>funded pension schemes and personal pension plans established in the State. Bord na M&oacute;na is no different in this regard.</p><p>  I, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the Scheme changes on 20 May. These will take effect this month. </p></reply>

I expect to seek Government approval of the text of the new Harbours Bill very shortly.  The new Bill will provide the legal basis for a later Ministerial order to effect the actual transfer in each case.  The Bill is designed to provide maximum legislative flexibility.  It will not prescribe the model of transfer in any particular case, but instead will allow for the most appropriate model of governance to be chosen in respect of each individual port.  The optimal manner of transfer will be the one which finds broad consensus and agreement between the parties. </p>  <p>  The Bill will provide two possible methods of transfer: 1.  A transfer of shareholding and continuation of the existing company structure; or 2, a dissolution of the company structure and full integration with local authority structures.</p>  <p>  My Department is funding a due diligence process which was procured by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and commenced recently.  The outcome of the due diligence will assist the strategic consideration of all relevant issues.</p></reply>

This first 3km runs from Ennis town centre to and through Lees Road Sports Grounds. It is anticipated that construction will commence in late June 2015.  Discussions are ongoing in relation to access and repairs to the old Railway line, its boundaries, accommodation works etc. No agreements are in place as yet.  It is anticipated that a Phase 1 Contract 2 to complete the remaining 1.5km could commence in the Autumn subject to agreement being reached regarding land issues.</p>  <p>  No design work has taken place on Phases 2 and 3.  Research into land ownership has been undertaken to determine private ownership and CIE ownership.  To date no contact has been made with landowners and no funding is in place for these sections.</p>  <p>  Phase 4 is already in place and was delivered with funding provided by my Department under the 2012-2013 National Cycle Network funding programme.  This section is operational as a widened footpath linking Ennistymon to Lahinch - with information boards and cycle stands in place in both towns.</p></reply>

It has been a matter of policy for some time to reach bilateral agreements of this kind with Canada.  Arriving at such agreements can be a complex process, as it requires the licensing authorities on both sides to study the two systems and satisfy themselves that they are compatible.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  As driver licensing in Canada operates at provincial rather than national level, we much reach separate agreements with each province.  It was agreed from the start to prioritise agreement with Ontario, due to the large number of Irish residents there.  I am happy to say that agreement was reached with Ontario, and has been in operation since October 2014.  A further agreement, with Manitoba, came into operation in May of 2015.</p>  <p>  The RSA is continuing to work towards agreement with the other Canadian provinces, including Alberta.  I understand that good progress is being made, but that it is not possible at this stage to give a date when further agreements will be in place.</p></reply>

The prohibition provided for in section 14 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 addressed an anomaly whereby SPSV licences issued after January 2009 were non-transferable while licences issued prior to that date could be transferred once. The prohibition took effect from 6th April 2014 when the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 was commenced.</p>  <p>  In the event of the death of a SPSV licence holder as a consequence of the provisions of section 14, the SPSV licence would stand revoked. Therefore special provisions were made in section 15 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 in relation to the death of a SPSV licence holder. They provide that an applicant for a licence or the holder of a licence may nominate a person as his or her representative who may apply to the National Transport Authority to continue to operate the licence in the event of his or her death. In the event of the death of the licence holder, his or her nominated representative may, within 3 months of the death of the licence holder, make an application to the National Transport Authority to continue to operate the licence until its expiry.</p>  <p>  I therefore do not propose to amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 in relation to the prohibition on transfer of SPSV licences.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  It is important to state that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Mayo County Council in their own resources spending this area. While Councils could apply in the past for grant funding for certain road improvement projects, budgetary constraints mean that the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme has been curtailed in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work of the road network.</p>  <p>  The current financial realities are such that the budgets proposed for my Department for 2016 and 2017 indicate that capital funding will continue to be very tight, and the ability to increase allocations or progress new projects is limited. It is, of course, open to Mayo County Council to fund such projects from its own resources.</p></reply>

While there is no specific funding mechanisms for the area referred to, my Department is currently operating the Structures at Risk Fund 2015 to support the conservation and repair of heritage structures, in both private and public ownership that are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), and which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. This fund, which has an allocation of &euro;624,000, is administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The deadline for applications to this fund has now passed.</p>  <p>  The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 will be focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p>  <p>  Funding will continue to be provided by my Department via a number of schemes, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and certain agencies. </p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, has also recently awarded funding of &euro;547,000 to 197 heritage projects nationwide, under its 2015 Community-based Heritage Grants Scheme.

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of the architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures, and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  Given that in this instance the owner is the local authority, Monaghan County Council, it is, therefore, primarily its responsibility to address the issues identified by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council is a statutory consultee under provisions of the Planning and Development Act but is an independent body.  Under section 10 (1) of the Heritage Act 1995, the Council, in its own right, can advise a public authority on a heritage building.  I have no role in directing the Council under this section.  It is a matter for the Council to decide how it prioritises and manages its various responsibilities under the Heritage Act.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to be available to advise local authorities on the conservation, reuse and regeneration of historic structures, where applicable.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the administration of the licence applications for paintings, under the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act 1945, was delegated to the National Gallery of Ireland in April 1985.</p>  <p>  A licence was granted by the National Gallery of Ireland, under the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act 1945, for the recent export of paintings by the Beit Foundation. I will ask the National Gallery to provide a list of any export licences issued by it by year, from 2010 to date in 2015, for paintings or other works of art that are currently in the ownership of the Alfred Beit Foundation, or were assets of the Foundation at the time of grant of any such licence.</p>  <p>  I was informed of the decision of the Beit Foundation by the Chair of the Trustees two days in advance of the public announcement. Neither I nor my Department was informed in advance of any decision of the Foundation or the National Gallery in regard to the matters referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Questions.</p>  <p>  As I have stated in replies to previous Questions regarding this matter, the administration of the Beit Foundation, which owns and operates Russborough House, is a matter for the Trustees and my Department has no role in the matter.</p></reply>
