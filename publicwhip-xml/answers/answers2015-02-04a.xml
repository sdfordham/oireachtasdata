This is a confidential matter between Ireland and the Commission and I am not in a position to comment on the specific details of our response as the matter is subject to a formal process of investigation and relates to a specific taxpayer.</p>  <p>  While it would not be appropriate to speculate on the outcome at this stage, I remain confident that there was no breach of State aid rules in this case and that the legislative provisions were correctly applied. The Commission have indicated publicly that they expect to make their final decision on this issue in the first half of 2015.</p>  <p>  After an investigation such as this, the Commission may decide that there is no state aid after a Member State provides the additional information and clarification. </p>  <p>  However, in the event that the Commission forms the view that there was state aid, Ireland is entitled to challenge this decision in the European Courts.  As I and my colleagues in Government have already indicated, we will take that course of action, if necessary, to continue to vigorously defend the Irish position.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-04a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020400069#WRA00700"><p>The tax framework for Real Estate Investment Trust companies was introduced into law in Finance Act 2013.  My officials have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no tax return data available yet in relation to the three REITs that have been established:  </p>  <p>  - The first REIT to be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange was the Green REIT plc in July 2013 but my understanding is that this REIT did not make its first property investment until November 2013.  </p>  <p>  - The second Irish REIT, Hibernia REIT plc, listed in December 2013 and did not make its first acquisition of property until the early months of 2014.</p>  <p>  - The third Irish REIT, Irish Residential Properties REIT plc, listed in April 2014 with an existing portfolio of over 300 residential units and commenced to make further property acquisitions shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  The first REIT corporation tax returns and accounts are not expected before the end of the first quarter of 2015 and it should be noted that such returns and accounts will be of somewhat limited value in attempting to ascertain tax costs associated with REITs.  The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle. </p>  <p>  As such, the estimated cost attached to REITs relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income in the hands of investors, to the taxation of dividends distributed to investors from REIT profits arising from that rental income.  The REIT legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  </p>  <p>  As regards the taxation of the REIT itself, REITs are investment vehicles that are specifically designed to hold rental investment property.  They are focused on long-term holding of income-producing property.  They are not designed to undertake development activities, or as a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.</p>  <p>  A REIT is allowed to do a very limited amount of development of its rental assets   up to 30% of the value of any property   without impairing its REIT status.  This is allowed in order that a REIT may finish out a nearly-complete property, or carry out periodic refurbishments. </p>  <p>  If the REIT exceeds these limits and does not subsequently hold the completed property for at least three years as a rental asset, any gain on the sale of the developed property will not qualify for the REIT exemption and will be subject to tax under the normal rules.</p>  <p>  With regard to the housing market, the Deputy will be aware that Construction 2020 Strategy: A Strategy for A Renewed Construction Sector sets out the Government's strategy to address a number of issues being faced in the property and construction market and remove blockages from the system in order to get the market moving and increase supply.  Some 75 time-bound actions are included in the Strategy, my Department is party to a range of actions which, among other issues, focus on: </p>  <p>  - housing supply, with particular attention directed at planning issues and appropriate and sustainable development financing; </p>  <p>  - transparent and sustainable mortgage lending; </p>  <p>  - the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors; and </p>  <p>  addressing legacy issues associated with the property bubble. </p>  <p>  This includes facilitating the sustainable and professional development of the private rented sector.  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been characterised by small-scale landlords. Attracting large scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example using Real Estate Investment Trusts and other options for long-term investment, can have an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard sector that tenants deserve.  </p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of targeted initiatives in various budgets since 2011 to aid in revitalising the property and construction sectors and to help increase the supply of suitable residential housing stock in certain urban areas where supply limitations are most pronounced, including the introduction of the REIT tax framework in Budget 2013.  </p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional REITs is part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and property tenants.   While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  For example, since its launch in April 2014, Irish Residential Properties REIT, the first Irish REIT with a primarily residential property investment focus, has built up a portfolio of high quality Dublin residential properties.  It recently reported that as of September 2014 it had acquired 1,204 residential units which it was professionally operating with an occupancy rate of c. 99%.</p>  <p>  We must remember that the REIT regime is in its relative infancy in Ireland.  We expect the sector to continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.</p></reply>

The themed inspection includes onsite inspections of a number of regulated mortgage lenders to examine the processes in place around certain provisions of the CCMA and the controls lenders have in place to ensure compliance with those processes and the CCMA.<br/><br/>Overall, the CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long-term resolution is sought.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-04a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020400069#WRA01300"><p>A way forward for Permanent TSB was agreed with the Troika in April 2012 which envisaged it playing an important role in the future of Irish retail banking, being a more focused retail bank bringing competition to the marketplace which has consolidated significantly since 2008. In this regard Permanent TSB prepared a Restructuring Plan, which was submitted to the European Commission ("the Commission") in June 2012. As requested by the Commission, an updated version of the plan was submitted in August 2013 which incorporated improvements in performance over the intervening period.</p>  <p>  The Permanent TSB restructuring plan submitted in autumn 2013 is now outdated and has been updated for both recent positive financial and operational performance in 2014 and the results of the Comprehensive Assessment. My officials have been in detailed discussions with the Commission over recent months in relation to the plan, details of which are confidential between the parties and commercially sensitive at the present time. However, I expect the restructuring plan to be agreed in advance of the capital raise.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware Permanent TSB is an important bank in a highly concentrated Irish market. While no restructuring plan has been approved, it has not prevented Permanent TSB from making significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan. Permanent TSB has made steady progress on returning to operating profitability, has significantly de-risked its balance sheet through a sale of a tranche of its UK mortgage portfolio and the sale of Springboard Mortgages and has made positive progress on arrears reductions, with 90 day + arrears in Homeloans c. 33% below peak levels at end 2014. I expect that the bank's full year 2014 annual results, which will be issued on the 11th   March 2015 will confirm this. </p>  <p>  With regards to the Capital Raise, the Comprehensive Assessment Adverse Stress Test result identified a shortfall of &euro;855 million. As a consequence the bank has submitted a Capital Plan to the SSM, which outlines how the bank intends to meet the capital shortfall.  Much of the shortfall has been met through performance in 2014 and deleverage of assets in 2014. The remaining shortfall will require the bank to raise capital, including equity capital, from private sources in 2015, diluting the State's shareholding.  Details of the capital raise will be finalised shortly.  While there are no current plans to sell shares held by the State during the process I will keep this under review as it could be required to ensure a successful capital raise process for the State and other shareholders.  </p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure Permanent TSB is well prepared, that it conducts a comprehensive and competitive exercise to raise the capital with appropriate legal and financial advice, and that the State has meaningful oversight and involvement in the process. Officials from my Shareholding Management Unit and our financial advisers, JP Morgan Cazenove, are well placed to fulfil this role. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-04a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015020400069#WRA01500"><p>In Budget 2015 I announced my intention to launch a public consultation on the issue of unused zoned and serviced land with a view to examining what taxation measures might be taken to penalise land owners who do not develop such land. I expect to launch this consultation shortly.</p>  <p>  The aim of the public consultation will be to assess the extent to which the taxation system - through penal measures   can be utilised to encourage the development of such zoned and serviced land to assist with the shortage of residential properties in certain areas.  Any existing levies will be considered as part of the consultation process and any taxation measures that may be introduced as a result of the consultation will take account of any existing levies in place.</p>  <p>  The Government's Construction 2020 Strategy published in May 2014 outlined a range of actions aimed at incentivising increased housing construction activity and supply. These actions are being progressed as a matter of urgency, including measures incorporated in the forthcoming Planning and Development No. 1 Bill , for example the revision of the Part V social housing obligations on developers, retrospective application of reduced development contributions, the introduction of the vacant site levy and "use it or lose it" arrangements in relation to planning permissions.</p>  <p>  In addition, further to the Construction 2020 Strategy, a Dublin Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force was established in June 2014 to examine the issue of housing supply in the Dublin area. It has reported that there are currently sufficient planning permissions, with no insurmountable infrastructural deficits, to deliver over 20,000 housing units in four Dublin local authority areas while a further 25,000 new homes are considered permissible on existing lands zoned for residential use if landowners and developers wished to seek those permissions. The objective of the Government now is to facilitate the activation of such permissions with a view to delivering on the associated housing supply to meet demand. The possible introduction of tax measures to incentivise the development of zoned and serviced land will be considered in this overall context.</p></reply>

In that year, approximately 44% of claimants had incomes of between &euro;0 and &euro;20,000, while almost 20% of claimants had incomes of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000. 27% had incomes of between &euro;40,000 and &euro;100,000, while under 10% had incomes in excess of &euro;100,000.<br/><br/>These figures show that for 2012, approximately 64% of individuals who availed of the Artists' Exemption had incomes that in total fell below the current &euro;50,000 limit for the exemption. <br/><br/>In relation to other sources of funding provided by the State, that would primarily be a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. However, I understand that artists can receive direct support through certain Arts Council's awards programmes: <br/><br/>1.  The Bursary Award supports artists in the development of their artistic practice.  In 2013,  the Arts Council distributed over &euro;1.2 million to 137 individual artists across all art forms and arts practices.  <br/><br/>2.  The Project Awards support the creation of new work and audience engagement.  The Arts Council disbursed over &euro;3 million to 106 recipients in 2013.  <br/><br/>3.  The Dance and Theatre Residency schemes saw the Council disburse &euro;256,342 to 15 recipients in 2013. <br/><br/>4.  Means-tested grants to 161 Aosd&aacute;na members totalling &euro;2.7m in 2013. <br/><br/>I would point out that the Artists' Exemption is a specified relief for the purposes of the high earners' restriction. This limits the amount of reliefs that an individual can claim in any one tax year to &euro;80,000 before the restriction begins to apply. <br/><br/>As the Deputy may be aware, my officials will be carrying out a review of the Artists' Exemption in advance of Budget 2016. The terms of this review have not yet been finalised but I expect it to commence shortly.</p></reply>

The Government approved this approach and legislation enabling the establishment of the SBCI was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014. <br/><br/>The SBCI was incorporated in August 2014 and since then the SBCI has made considerable progress in building relations with lending partners and in constructing the complex operational capability required to bring products to market. These include establishing operational capability with funders and lending partners, building internal systems and business processes, and establishing a team to safely and effectively manage the funding provided on behalf of the State. In that regard, it is worth pointing out that both the CEO of KfW and the President of the European Investment Bank have complimented the Government's work on the establishment of the SBCI noting that the project from concept to establishment was achieved much more promptly than similar initiatives in other countries. <br/><br/>The SBCI drew down &euro;200m of its funding from the European Investment Bank during December 2014 so that funds could be borrowed by its lending partners to be distributed to SMEs.  <br/><br/>The SBCI is preparing for a nationwide launch of its products shortly. The Government's aim for the SBCI is to change the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland. The SBCI are achieving this by working with existing and new providers to develop enhanced products, and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to be aware that I am seeking suitable applicants who consider they possess the skills and experience necessary to join the expanded board of SBCI. People who wish to contribute to the development of the SBCI and who possess a range of experience in SME finance and SME development can apply using the new state appointments process on .

Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector debt securities will amount to &euro;60 billion. These monthly purchases are intended to be carried out from March until end-September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until inflation moves onto a path consistent with price stability, in line with the mandate of the ECB.  In principle, this would see the ECB balance sheet expand to over &euro;1 trillion. </p>  <p>  Many details in terms of the implementation of the expanded asset purchase programme are not, as yet, publically available and these are, of course, an internal matter for the ECB and the National Central Banks. The ECB has, however, indicated that its asset purchase programme in relation to sovereign bonds will be restricted to bonds with a remaining maturity of greater than 2 but less than 30 years.  It has also indicated limits on the Eurosystem's holdings of any one issuer's bonds, taking into account existing holdings.  These limits refer to the same 2 to 30 year maturity window.  </p>  <p>  To be precise, holdings within the 2 to 30 year remaining maturity window will not exceed 33 per cent of an issuers' tradable bonds within the same window.  The majority of the bonds acquired by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) in exchange for the Promissory Notes have more than 30 years remaining.  Currently, this is the case for &euro;19 billion out of the original &euro;25 billion nominal issuance.  Therefore, the holding of these bonds by the CBI will, in practice, have no impact on the amounts that can be purchased by the CBI.  While other bonds within the 2-30 year maturity window that are already held by the CBI and other National Central Banks will be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the amounts that can be purchased, I understand that this still leaves ample room for participation by the CBI in the asset purchase programme.</p></reply>

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud motorists and the State. Revenue has received 134 complaints to date, the majority of which originated from the counties covered by Revenue's Border Midland West Region. </p>  <p>  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them were sent for analysis by the State Laboratory. To date, samples have been taken from over 50 filling stations nationwide and 300 samples, from them and from other sources, have been referred to the State Laboratory.</p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests on the samples.   Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been  found in only two samples from one location. The conclusive results received from those two samples have resulted in the seizure of the product and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution. </p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol. If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take speedy and determined action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.</p>  <p>  Revenue have been working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this investigation, sharing information and intelligence, and will continue to do so. I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

In 2012, the latest year for which definitive figures are available, just over 11,000 taxpayers paid the 3% USC surcharge. This represents approximately 6% of taxpayers whose primary income is not subject to PAYE, or half of one per cent of all income earners.</p>  <p>  The introduction of USC in 2011 was accompanied by a series of other reform measures designed to simplify the tax system and widen the tax base. As part of these the PRSI ceiling on income over &euro;75,000 was removed for all employees. This meant that those employees on incomes in excess of &euro;75,000 would now be liable to an additional 4% charge on that portion of their income. At the same time the PRSI rates for self-assessed income earners was increased from 3% to 4%.</p>  <p>  At that time, a 3% USC surcharge, in addition to the 7% rate on that portion of self-assessed income over &euro;100,000, was introduced. The alternative would have seen self-assessed high income earners benefit when compared to their PAYE counterparts from the tax package introduced in 2011. On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.</p>  <p>  It was necessary to maintain the 3% in Budget 2015 in order to ensure that the self-assessed on high incomes did not benefit disproportionately from the Income Tax package and that the maximum benefit is capped for all taxpayers at &euro;14 per week.</p>  <p>  To allow large increases for the self-assessed on high incomes would be difficult to justify, or indeed would not be fiscally prudent, at a time when the country is only beginning to emerge from a prolonged economic downturn.</p>  <p>  Far from being anti-enterprise, a fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation. The Statement of Priorities issued by the Government in July 2014 included a commitment for an income tax reform plan  to be delivered over a number of budgets, to reduce the 52% marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, including the self-employed, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the self-assesed were subject to a marginal tax rate of 55% on incomes in excess of &euro;100,000 in 2014, and they will continue to face the same rate on such income in 2015.</p></reply>

The situation at end November shows that total mortgage accounts in arrears<b></b>(all arrears 1 day past due) now stand at 91,963.  The number of Principal Dwelling Home accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days and not restructured has fallen by almost 27%<b></b>at end of November 2014 when compared to the state of play at end of August 2013. During November 2014 there was an increase of 2,551 permanent mortgage restructures<b></b>over the previous month<b>. </b>The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,879<b></b>to 64,196 accounts at the end of November 2014.<br/><br/>The strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as a last resort and that every effort should be made to agree a sustainable arrangement as an alternative to repossession.  Even after the commencement of the legal process, it will be possible for lenders and borrowers to re-engage and it will be in the best interest of many parties if that can and does happen.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the issue of longer terms arrears remains the biggest challenge.  Many customers are finding solutions when they engage with their lender. Data published by the Central Bank in December shows that just under 110,000 principal dwelling home mortgages (PDH) were classified as restructured at the end of quarter 3 in 2014.  Of these restructured accounts, 83% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.<br/><br/>This Government has put in place a number of initiatives to assist homeowners in difficulty.  Borrowers in difficulty must engage with their lender as early as possible in order to identify the best solution to their debt situation.  This will afford them the protection of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and ensure that the resolution arrangement that is finally agreed is both affordable and sustainable.Of course, the Central Bank is also working to ensure that banks are fully complying with the codes of conduct.<br/><br/>In addition, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides independent advice and practical assistance to those in debt and I would advise anybody who is struggling with unsustainable debt to contact them as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) also has a role in restoring citizens who are insolvent to solvency in a fair, transparent and equitable way and will help people to address their problems.  It is essential that the banks and customers engage with each other.</p></reply>

These restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the impact of lending restrictions on the ability of credit unions to lend, I have been  further informed by the Registrar of Credit Unions that data available to the Central Bank shows that there is no material difference between the average loan-to-asset ratio of credit unions with and without restrictions. Also, where individual lending restrictions are imposed, this data also shows that the majority of credit unions are not lending up to the lending restriction amount, with the majority of loans granted being at lower loan levels. </p>  <p>  Reviews of individual lending restrictions are included within the planned 2015 supervisory work programme of the Registry of Credit Unions. Where credit unions can evidence improvements in their credit management practices, and systems and controls which support prudent lending, the Registrar is open to removal of restrictions. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the safety of members savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are central to any actions taken by the Registrar of Credit Unions.</p></reply>

Growth in the third quarter of 2014 was weak, at 0.2 per cent on a quarterly basis.  <br/><br/>In terms of this year, economic activity in the euro area will be supported by lower oil prices, supportive monetary policies and a depreciation of the euro. Notwithstanding these positive developments, other factors acting in the opposite direction - such as weaker investment - mean the IMF has revised down its forecast for the euro area by about a quarter of a per cent this year and next. The forecast for the UK was left broadly unchanged.<br/><br/>Reviving economic growth in the euro area will require a combination of monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies.  In relation to the fiscal stance, a differentiated approach is needed, whereby those with fiscal space should use it. On the monetary side, I welcome the recent policy announcement that the ECB is to expand its balance sheet through large scale asset purchases, including the purchase of sovereign debt in the secondary market (quantitative easing).

These discussions were streamed live by the event organisers and are available at: <br/><br/>As you will see from the recording, Madame Lagarde stated the view from the 188 countries in the IMF that debt should continue to be governed by contractual relationships between the creditors and the debtors.  Madame Lagarde continued that, while the IMF had tried in the past - without much success - to establish a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism, she would refrain from prescribed general collective approaches.<br/><br/>As I have stated on a number of occasion, including in the Press Conference following my meeting with Madame Lagarde and Minister Howlin, my view is that negotiation is better than conflict and unilateral action.

The grant of &euro;100 per annum will be available to all households, irrespective of the manner in which their water is provided and is not tied to expenditure on any particular aspect of water provision.  It is my Department's opinion that the grant has the characteristics of a transfer to households and is not a transfer to the water provider.  However, it will be the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office and Eurostat to classify this transfer for the purposes of returns required under the Maastricht Treaty. </p>  <p>  As a transfer from government, the conservation grant will be considered government expenditure. PQ 42850/14, which I answered on the 11th of November last, described the market test criteria that Irish Water and other semi-State companies must meet in order for their costs not to be included in the general Government accounts. The impact on the deficit if Irish Water is included in general government, which has been covered previously in PQ No. 68 (45572/14) of the 27th of November 2014, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;524 million in 2015.</p></reply>

This approach allows both Irish and non-Irish buyers to compete for all assets. It would not be in the interest of the State to favour any class of buyer or impose restrictions or curtailments on these transactions.</p>  <p>  As part of our broader efforts to attract much needed capital to Ireland in Th wake of the financial crises and generally encourage inward investment into Ireland, stakeholders across the Irish system, including the banks, NAMA, IBRC, the IDA, the NTMA as well as my officials and occasionally myself, do meet with investors interested in investing in Ireland including through the acquisition of loan or property assets and the establishment of business enterprises in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This has included occassional meetings with representatives of private equity funds who have purchased or may be interested in purchasing significant amounts of loans and assets from NAMA and other Irish sellers.  Such discussions do not involve the discussion of specific sales processes or specific assets but rather provide these investors with the opportunity to communicate their broader interests in and investment proposition regarding Ireland, their plans for further investment and potential for local business development and job creation.   They also provide myself and the other Irish institutions with increased visibility regarding Ireland's relative attractiveness as destination for foreign capital investment. </p></reply>

The standard rate band was also extended by &euro;1,000 to &euro;42,800 for jointly assessed married one earner couples and by &euro;2,000 to &euro;67,600 for married two earner couples.

In addition, only a small number of Member States apply zero-rated VAT treatment and the EU Commission has actively been trying to simplify the VAT rating system to improve the efficiency of the Single Market. This is a sensitive area for Ireland given our use of zero rates for social reasons in areas such as children's clothes and shoes, food, oral medicines, etc.  Accordingly, I do not consider that a proposal to seek a review of the application of national rules which existed prior to 1991 would succeed.</p></reply>

However, consistent with its overall commercial objectives, NAMA is making a very significant contribution in facilitating the delivery of social housing.  It has made 5,753 houses and apartments available to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing and has invested over &euro;20m to date in delivering homes for social housing in those cases where local authorities have confirmed demand.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may not appreciate that NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities.  Local authorities, through the auspices of the Housing Agency, have confirmed demand for 2,214 of the properties made available by NAMA.  The remaining properties made available by NAMA were ultimately deemed unsuitable by local authorities based on criteria such as their location and on wider planning and housing policy considerations or they were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers during the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm their suitability. </p>  <p>  Of the 2,214 properties for which demand has been confirmed, 1,068 have already been delivered for social housing through a combination of purchase and long-term leasing arrangements.  NAMA expects that the other units for which demand has been confirmed will be delivered in 2015 on the basis that local authorities and approved housing bodies contract to purchase or lease the properties.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, once demand is confirmed by local authorities through the Housing Agency and contracts have been entered into by local authorities or approved housing bodies, NAMA immediately makes the properties available.  This often involves significant investment by NAMA to complete building works and to carry out other work in order to resolve compliance issues in relation to planning conditions, regulatory standards and multi-unit Development requirements.  NAMA is facilitating the delivery of homes for individuals and families through this very welcome initiative. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that NAMA has established a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services Ltd. (NARPS), to expedite the delivery of social housing under this initiative.  Through NARPS, NAMA acquires houses and apartments from debtors and receivers and directly leases them to approved housing bodies under long-term leasing arrangements.  In conjunction with the establishment of NARPS, NAMA has introduced standardised leasing terms to further streamline the process.    </p>  <p>  NARPS has proven to be a very effective method of delivery and NAMA recently announced its intention to provide future Part V housing on NAMA-funded residential developments through this mechanism.   This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates that it funds and that such housing will be delivered on site in line with Government policy aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that NAMA, within the context of its overriding commercial objective, has done everything it can do to facilitate the delivery of social housing to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies through the existing residential stock securing its loans and it has clearly signalled its commitment to doing likewise through its funding for new residential development.  </p></reply>

It will address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Central Bank's codes and access for borrowers to the Financial Services Ombudsman after loan books are sold.  <br/><br/>This legislation will ensure that borrowers retain their existing protections when their loan is sold.  A key element of this is the protection of distressed borrowers.  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) was revised in 2013 to strengthen consumer protections, where necessary, and to ensure that the Code is facilitating the resolution of each case in a fair, sustainable and transparent manner.  <br/><br/>The CCMA is a statutory Code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The CCMA's consumer protection framework ensures that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. Under the CCMA, borrowers have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement, or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.The CCMA provides that such an appeal must be considered by personnel who have not been previously involved in the case.</p></reply>

The Commission were of the belief that the requirement of the exemption that a claimant be resident solely in Ireland discriminated against residents in other Member States. As a result, I decided to amend the scheme to ensure that it is compatible with EU law.

However, the exemption will only be of benefit to those artists who are liable to income tax in Ireland. The exemption will not apply in their home country. </p></reply>

In total, there were 15,734 Borrower Groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the 6 portfolios.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, the Special Liquidators announced that this initial loan sales process had concluded. The sales process of the IBRC loan assets, including their segmentation to meet demand from international buyers, delivered a very positive result with over 90% of the loan assets (with a par value of &euro;21.7bn) being sold. </p>  <p>  As it became apparent that the expected proceeds to be raised from the sale of the IBRC loan assets were to be sufficient to fully repay the IBRC debt to NAMA, I, as Minister for Finance, instructed that NAMA were no longer obliged to purchase the unsold IBRC assets at their independent valuation as previously envisaged. </p>  <p>  Since that instruction, the Special Liquidators have undertaken further sales processes in respect of unsold assets so as to maximise the return to all remaining creditors of IBRC, including the State. </p>  <p>  Following representations received from borrowers and the independent advice received, the final loan assets were split into two portfolios: Pearl (into two tranches) and Quartz (initially split into six tranches, but subsequently consolidated into five tranches). Pearl comprised the unsold residential mortgage loan assets and Quartz comprised mostly  commercial real estate loan assets. </p>  <p>  The sale of the Pearl portfolio was contracted prior to 31st December 2014. The sale of tranche 1 of Pearl has since completed with the sale of tranche 2 of Pearl to complete before 28th February 2015. The five tranches of the Quartz portfolio were contracted for sale prior to 31st December 2014 with the sale of four of these tranches now complete. The sale of the final tranche is due to complete this Friday, 6th February 2015. </p>  <p>  The Special Liquidators have published advertisements and written to those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the liquidation. Creditors in the UK and Ireland have until 31st March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US have until 31st May 2015. Once all claims have been submitted, they will be reviewed in detail and adjudicated on by the Special Liquidators. In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claim.</p>  <p>  It will be some time before the Special Liquidators will be in a position to advise on the likely dividends to be payable to creditors (including the State) given:</p>  <p>1.

We have successfully exited the EU/IMF programme and we have the fastest growing economy in Europe, with an increase of around 85,000 in the total number at work since the low point. <br/><br/>Our debt-to-GDP ratio is now on a declining path. Indeed, our net debt level - at 91 per cent of GDP at the end of last year - means that we are in a relatively healthy position, which is evident from the fact that we can borrow at record low interest rates. <br/><br/>In the most recent Budget we were in a position to invest in public services and to reduce the tax burden on individuals for the first time since the crisis began. So we are making real progress.<br/><br/>The Irish people have made major sacrifices to achieve this economic and financial stability and this must not be taken for granted. This Government will continue to act prudently to ensure this remains the case.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must &ndash; </p>  <p>* have at least 520 paid contributions and </p>  <p>* satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). </p>  <p>  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  A mixed insurance pro-rata State pension is one of a number of qualifying methods introduced to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for a State pension contributory.  This was introduced in 1991 and was designed to ensure that people who have contributed to the social insurance system at different rates receive a pension which reflects the proportion of full rate contributions which exists in their overall insurance record.</p>  <p>  This pension is calculated by taking the total number of contributions (modified and full rate) a person has paid over their working life and applying the average contributions test to arrive at the rate which would be paid if all contributions were at the full rate.  The actual rate to be paid is determined by the proportion of full rate contributions in the overall record. A similar arrangement applies when calculating pensions due under EU regulations or bilateral social security agreements.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219.</p></reply>

The levy was introduced in 2011 to fund the Jobs Initiative and has applied at a rate of 0.6% for the years 2011 to 2013, at an aggregate rate of 0.75% for 2014 and will apply at a reduced rate of 0.15% for this year. In accordance with the provisions in section 125B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 (SDCA), the stamp duty levy on pension fund assets will end after 2015.</p>  <p>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) responsible for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.</p>  <p>  While I would expect that, in carrying out their responsibilities in this matter, pension scheme trustees would examine all the options open to them regarding how to deal with the impact of the levy, including an approach to the employer sponsors of the scheme, neither I or the Government made any statement to the effect that employers would be required to meet the cost of the levy.</p>  <p>   I have no detailed information on the decisions made by pension fund trustees or others in relation to the passing on of the full or a partial impact of the levy to the current, deferred or former (retired) members of pension schemes. I am aware, however, that in certain cases where trustees have made the decision to pass on the impact or part of the impact of the levy to pensioners, that a smaller reduction in pension payments over the lifetime of the pension have been made in preference to a larger reduction over a shorter period.</p>  <p>  The pension fund legislation includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed the relevant percentage (0.6%, 0.75% or 0.15%, as appropriate) of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme's liabilities to that member. </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are afforded oversight authority to review, where they consider it appropriate, instances where benefits are adjusted as a result of the payment of the levy to ensure that any such adjustment is in keeping with the requirements of the levy legislation.  In undertaking any such review Revenue may consult with appropriate experts as they see fit.  However, before Revenue could act in that regard, instances of concern on foot of actual adjustments would first have to be brought formally to its attention.</p>  <p>  Finally, while I am very conscious of the sacrifices that Irish taxpayers, generally, have been required to make over the past number of years, the fact is that without the pension fund levy there would not have been the Job Initiative measures such as the reduced VAT rate of 9% and other measures which have been very successful in helping to create employment and protect employment in this economy.</p></reply>

The European Commission in its autumn forecasts estimated that real unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 4.3 per cent annually in 2014, which is the largest decline across all EU Member States and compares with a fall of 1.2 per cent in the UK, and increases of 0.1 per cent in the EU, 0.2 per cent in the US and 0.3 per cent in the euro over the same time period.  Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation as compared with our trading partners as well as productivity improvements.</p>  <p>  Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2009.  HICP inflation turned negative in December, largely due to a fall in oil prices, nonetheless core inflation (which excludes energy and unprocessed food) was also weak.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the ECB's recent quantitative easing announcement is to be welcomed.  The Irish economy should benefit through a number of channels.  For example, the economy should benefit directly through improved financing conditions for households and firms.  In addition, the euro area is Ireland's single largest export destination; therefore, by supporting real economic activity and raising inflation in the euro area this will underpin export growth in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Monetary policy also works through the exchange rate channel the  recent depreciation of the euro will provide a boost to Irish exports.</p></reply>

The strategy was formulated in response to the recommendations of the Keane Report (2011) and the main elements of it are:<br/><br/>- Engagement with the banks to develop appropriate measures for their customers in mortgage arrears;<br/><br/>- Personal insolvency law reform and implementation;<br/><br/>- Mortgage to rent; and<br/><br/>- A Mortgage Advisory function.<br/><br/>The Strategy is working as evidenced by the monthly improvements in the mortgage restructures data collected by my Department officials.  The situation at end November shows that total mortgage accounts in arrears<b></b>(all arrears 1 day past due) now stand at 91,963.  The number of Principal Dwelling Home accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days and not restructured has fallen by almost 27%<b></b>at end of November 2014 when compared to the state of play at end of August 2013.  During November 2014 there was an increase of 2,551 permanent mortgage restructures<b></b>over the previous month<b>.  </b>The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,879<b></b>to 64,196 accounts at the end of November 2014.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The CCMA includes an appeals process which enables a dissatisfied borrower to request that their case be examined by senior personnel who were not previously involved in the case.<br/><br/>Monitoring compliance with the CCMA continues to be  an important part of the Central Bank's work programme and I have been informed that the Central Bank commenced a themed inspection of compliance with the CCMA in Q4 2014.  The scope of the themed inspection includes on-site inspections of a number of regulated mortgage lenders to examine the processes and controls relating to compliance with certain provisions of the CCMA.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions. Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#444444">My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.

The latest available data for 2014 show that GDP growth for the first three quarters of the year is broadly in line with my Department's forecast at Budget time.</p>  <p>  According to recent figures published by the European Commission, it expects Ireland to be the fastest growing economy in Europe in 2014 and 2015.  Importantly, domestic demand is making a positive contribution to growth for the first time since the crisis began.  Consumer spending has been strong in 2014 with retail sales up over 6 per cent compared with 2013.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up close to 4 per cent in 2014.  Investment in building and construction as well as in machinery and equipment spending are on a rising path. </p>  <p>  Exports rose by 15.5 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2014.  This was the fastest rate of expansion since 2001.  Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market with employment having increased in each of the last eight quarters to the third quarter 2014, representing an increase of over 80,000 jobs since the low-point in mid-2012.  In line with this, the standardised unemployment rate stood at 10.6 per cent in December, having fallen from a peak of 15.1 per cent in early 2012. </p>  <p>  Macroeconomic forecasts for the years 2014 to 2018 were presented by my Department on Budget Day, last October.  These forecasts see GDP growth of 4.7 per cent in 2014 and 3.9 per cent this year.  This growth is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of growth in Ireland's trading partners. Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption over the period.  Over the medium term, GDP growth of about 3&frac12; per cent a year is anticipated.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current improvement, risks to the outlook remain.  These relate to the low inflation observed in many advanced economies, geo-political tensions as well as the underperformance of the euro area economy.</p>  <p>  In terms of the public finances, policy measures implemented by the Government have resulted in a decline in the deficit in recent years.  This decline has been in a phased manner, consistent with the dual needs of supporting domestic activity as well as repairing the public finances.  All of the interim deficit ceilings under the Excessive Deficit Procedure have been met and Ireland is firmly on track to achieve a deficit of below 3 per cent this year.  This has been important in restoring Ireland's credibility in the international markets, and bond yields have fallen substantially since the highs of mid-2011.  The debt ratio has peaked and is now on a downward path.  After 2015, fiscal policy will be set in line with the requirement to move towards Ireland's medium-term budgetary objective, which is for a balanced budget in structural terms.</p></reply>

According to the Central Statistics Office, national residential property prices increased by 16.3 per cent in the 12 months to December.  Prices in Dublin rose by 22.3 per cent while price growth nationally excluding Dublin stood at 10.2 per cent over the same period.</p>  <p>  Under Construction 2020, the Government has set out a strategy for addressing issues in the property and construction sectors.  The strategy involves addressing any critical bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand.  It incorporates 75 time-bound actions encompassing the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply, identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process to facilitate appropriate development, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision. </p>  <p>  To further underpin a whole-of-government approach to these issues, in July last the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Minister of State Paudie Coffey TD, was given responsibility for driving construction work forward.</p>  <p>  In summary, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor price developments in both the purchase and rental property markets.  As set out in the Construction 2020 Strategy, the Government will continue to work on addressing remaining challenges in the property and construction sectors.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is worth noting that the European Commission will release its Winter Forecasts later this week in which it is expected that it will address the impact of falling oil prices. </p>  <p>  From an Irish perspective, the price of Brent crude oil has fallen by about 45 per cent in euro terms (nearly 50 per cent in US dollar terms) since the end of last September, when the macroeconomic projections that underpin Budget 2015 were finalised.  For the most part, this is a positive development which is likely to have a favourable impact on real economic activity in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a net energy importer and, as such, falls in oil prices have a positive impact in the short term. Lower energy prices reduce firms' input costs, thereby improving profitability and competitiveness.  At the household level, lower energy prices are likely to lead to an increase in real disposable incomes (i.e. through lower inflation), which can be used to reduce indebtedness or increase consumption on other goods and services.</p>  <p>  In terms of quantifying the impact, a reasonable rule of thumb is that, everything else being equal, each sustained &euro;10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil boosts the level of real GDP by somewhere in the region of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points.</p></reply>

The operational framework for the DRI, approved on the same date, includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  The guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.</p>  <p>  However, unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to support Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.</p>  <p>  My overall objective in relation to the State's investment in the banks is to maximise the return to the Irish taxpayer over time. In line with this objective my Department is working with AIB, the institution where &euro;20.8 billion has been invested, on reconfiguring the capital structure.  I have also appointed Goldman Sachs International to provide financial advice. The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time.  While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  I can assure you that all realistic options remain on the table and I must emphasise that it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or indeed to put a timeline on decisions.</p></reply>

This survey series, currently being conducted by Red C on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs. SMEs of all sizes trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.<br/><br/>The most recent survey, covering the period April-September 2014, shows that 86% of SMEs had their credit applications approved by the banks.  This is an increase of 16% on the same period in 2011.  The survey also showed positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.  The results of this survey feed into the deliberations of the SME State Bodies Group and consequently assist in shaping the commitments contained in the &quot;Finance for Growth&quot; chapter of Action Plan for Jobs 2015.<br/><br/>As I have stated previously, since the beginning of 2014 the policy focus has shifted towards the collation and examination, on a monthly basis, of more granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector.  Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.  In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, particularly lending to the domestic market, and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector. Both banks have recently reported increased year on year sanctioning activity for lending to the SME sector.<br/><br/><font color="#444444">My Department and the Credit Review Office monitor the data received monthly from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a regional and sectoral basis but this is commercially sensitive information and I am not in a position to release it.</font></p></reply>

In the third quarter of 2014 (the latest quarter for which information is available) new mortgage lending surpassed the &euro;1bn mark in a quarter for the first time since 2010. In the year to end September 2014, some &euro;2.5bn in residential mortgage loans was drawn down which compared to circa &euro;1.6bn in the same period in 2013.  Furthermore almost 93% of all new mortgage lending in the third quarter of 2014 was to first time buyers or to those moving property in respect of an owner occupied property.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland has recently announced new macro prudential regulations for residential mortgage lending.  First time buyers will be subject to a maximum mortgage LTV of 90% for a property valued up to &euro;220,000, and subject to an 80% LTV on any excess value above that amount.  For non first time buyers, a mortgage will be limited to 80% of the value of a principal dwelling house.</p>  <p>  However, investors who wish to purchase a buy to let property will have to meet a higher deposit threshold when borrowing from a bank to fund the purchase.  Such borrowers will be subject to a loan to value ratio of 70% meaning that they will have to have 30% deposit in order to obtain a mortgage on a buy to let property.</p></reply>

This remains the position.  </p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, the effect of the 'grace period' is that persons who retire during it have their gross superannuation benefits calculated on the basis of the pre-pay cut pay rates, which were reduced on July 2013 by 5.5% or more.  Pensions are then subject to a reduction under the same legislation of between 2 and 5%, reducing the immediate benefit to the individual.</p>  <p>  Section 9(1)(b)(ii) of the legislation empowers me to extend the 'grace period' provided for under the Act, taking into account such legal, superannuation and personnel management issues affecting public service bodies as I consider appropriate.

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th in ICON Plc.   The Action Plan process is working.  Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels.  Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th according to the IMD.  The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.6 per cent at end 2014.  Each of the Ireland&rsquo;s regions have recorded some increase in employment since the start of 2012 with the largest increases recorded in Dublin (+35,000); South-East (+21,300) and Border region (+16,200). </p>  <p>  In 2014, client companies of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland created 8,476 and 7,131 net new jobs respectively; this represents the highest levels of net new job creation by agency client companies in over a decade.  Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people and total employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies stands at 180,072; this is the highest level of employment recorded in the history of both agencies. </p>  <p>  In 2012, 2013 and 2014, on a quarterly basis we have reported in detail on the implementation of measures in the Action Plan for Jobs to support the transformation of the economy, with a success rate of over 90 per cent.  Over 1,000 action have been implemented to date and a further 380 actions are set out in the 2015 Action Plan and the details of progress are available in the quarterly reports.</p>  <p>  The many areas where my Department has delivered reform include:</p>  <p>- in the areas of entrepreneurship, the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices and launch of &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition;</p>  <p>- making Ireland the most attractive location in the world for ICT talent through the ICT Skills Action Plan which aims to increase the level of highly skilled professionals domestically, ensuring that three quarters of job openings can be filled from the Irish education system by 2018.</p>  <p>- new staff in EI and IDA Ireland overseas offices in high growth and emerging markets;</p>  <p>- establishing a Health Innovation Hub, with the Department of Health, to position Ireland as a leading location for medtech and healthcare companies;</p>  <p>- implementation of major strategic initiatives in key sectors to grow jobs and exports in the food and beverage sector through Enterprise Ireland as part of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy; and</p>  <p>- the establishment of a Retail Forum and other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will be a further step along the way in meeting this medium-term goal for Ireland.  The themes in this year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship and in fostering new sources of growth for the economy, the conditions to achieve the target of 100,000 extra people at work by 2016 and contribute to our longer-term goal of restoring the country to have 2.1 million at work in 2018.</p></reply>

When a decision or recommendation issues, it is accompanied by an "Appeal Information sheet" which sets out the relevant information regarding appeal/implementation, having regard to the specific piece of legislation under which the claim was submitted.  Either party may appeal a decision or recommendation from the Rights Commissioner Service.  This should be done in writing and submitted within the appropriate time period, which is dependent on the legislation under which the claim was made. </p>  <p>  Where an employer has not implemented the decision, and no appeal has been lodged within the specified time, the claimant or their representative, may then bring the decision to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Labour Court, District Court or Circuit Court, or where appropriate, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for implementation or enforcement, having regard to the particular requirements of the legislation, under which the claim was made. </p>  <p>  As a general rule the party to whom an award is made may pursue the matter of enforcement of an unpaid award directly with the courts service.  However, in cases other than those covered by the Payment of Wages Act, where an award made by a body remains outstanding, and where an employee is not in a position to go to the Circuit Court, the matter can be referred to the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) Enforcement Services Unit, which may, in certain circumstances make an application to the Courts for an order on his/her behalf. </p>  <p>  In deciding whether or not to intervene in the Minister&rsquo;s name, NERA has regard to the amount of the award, the potential for achieving a favourable outcome for the claimant and the scale of the costs likely to be incurred in doing so.  The NERA enforcement unit can be contacted directly on 059 9178890.</p>  <p>  The collection of any money outstanding in respect of a Circuit Court order is the responsibility of the relevant County Sheriff. </p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo; former employer was a limited company, the company must be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim for payment of an award under the insolvency payments scheme.  The purpose of the insolvency payments scheme, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act, 1984, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Rights Commissioners, etc., are also covered by the scheme.  There are statutory limitations on the amount payable.  An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, has responsibility for the administration of the payments from the insolvency payments scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the programme to reform the State&rsquo;s employment rights and industrial relations structures is at an advanced stage.  This reform programme will result in the establishment of a new two-tier Workplace Relations structure comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. </p>  <p>  Provision has been made in the Workplace Relations Bill 2014 for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of Compliance Notices and Fixed Payment Notices.  The Bill also makes provision for the introduction of a more effective and streamlined system for the enforcement of awards from WRC Adjudicators and/or the Labour Court under employment rights legislation via the District Court.  These new compliance and enforcement measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.</p></reply>

The regulations require that advisors are suitably qualified and regularly trained. In addition, in order to be approved as a GLAS Advisor, an advisor must also be an approved FAS advisor.  In determining the level of educational qualifications required to be a FAS/GLAS advisor, my Department must ensure that such qualifications are of an appropriate standard to meet the objectives and the requirements of the various schemes, and the associated governing legislation, on which advice is being provided.  Advisors must be qualified to interpret soil tests, understand the requirements of all schemes and understand constraints of land management imposed by various land designations.  Furthermore, advisors must be in a position to translate this knowledge into detailed management plans and also advice for farmers not only on the schemes requirements but also on their farm operations.   </p>  <p>In order to ensure that advisors meet the requirements outlined above, my Department requires that all advisors must have attained a HETAC Level 8 Bachelor Degree in Agricultural Science/Land Management in Agriculture and must have taken soil science and an animal or crop production subject to a level 8 (NFQ) degree standard.   </p>  <p>  My Department recently carried out a review of the educational qualification requirements for FAS/GLAS advisors following the receipt of appeal from Mountbellew Agricultural College/GMIT in relation to the BSc in Agriculture and Environment Management with the add-on BSc in Rural Enterprise and Environment, which had been deemed as not meeting the required standard.  This review was undertaken by an officer independent of the original decision making process. </p>  <p>This review, which incorporated a detailed examination of all documentation submitted as part of the appeal, identified that the course did not meet the standard of educational qualifications required as some of core subjects of soil science and animal and crop production were assessed only as part of the level 7 degree.  The required standard to be approved as an FAS/GLAS advisor is that these core subjects must be taken/assessed as part of a level 8 degree programme.   </p>  <p>  I am currently considering these issues further.</p></reply>

One of the conditions of the above Scheme requires that any lands declared &lsquo;be used and managed by the applicant&rsquo;.  As the person named confirmed to my Department , by phone call, on 25 October 2012 that he was not farming any of the land parcels declared, no payment was due to him under the 2012 Scheme.  A review of this decision will be undertaken and an official from my Department will contact the person named directly to discuss the matter.  An application under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 14<sup>th</sup>May 2013.  A review of the land parcels declared revealed that a number of the land parcels declared contained ineligible features resulting in an over-declaration of greater than 20% meaning no payment was due in respect of 2013. <br/><br/>Following an appeal from the person named, a visit by a Department official to verify the position was necessary to progress the matter.  This check resulted in the application of a significantly lower penalty of 15.94% which will result in a double the difference penalty being applied to the 2013 payment of the person named.  The person named was notified of the outcome of the inspection in a letter dated 18<sup>th</sup>December 2014 and advised of the right of a further appeal to the independently-chaired LPIS Appeals Committee.  No such appeal has been received and the results of the verification visit have now been processed and payment due for 2013 Single Payment will issue to the person named as soon as possible. <br/><br/>An application under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 8<sup>th</sup>May 2014.

Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. <br/><br/>I would again repeat the point that there are also data protection issues arising from vetting subjects, where any sensitive personal information which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up to date in order to avoid being exposed to public liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out of date information. <br/><br/>Last year the Garda Central Vetting Unit processed over 318,000 applications and this year to date it has processed in excess of 8,000. The majority of these applications were dealt in a four week processing time. <br/><br/>Given the necessity to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable people in society, the current vetting systems and processing times offer an effective and efficient service to registered organisations and their employees.</p></reply>

I can also advise the deputy that in the vast majority of cases the applicants are availing of independent legal advice with regard to accepting the offer and my department is facilitating this by providing a payment of up to &euro;500 + VAT towards the cost of obtaining legal advice.   </p>  <p>  The processing of all applications starts off on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have incomplete or no record for an applicant my officials must carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive, they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  In some instances, applicants will have a very clear recollection and records will be found to confirm their recollection.</p>  <p>  In other instances applicants may have difficulty in recollecting details and may be mistaken about the institution they were in and also about the period of time they were there.  This is not surprising as we could be talking about events that happened 50, 60 or 70 years ago. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that for cases where there is insufficient documentary evidence to make a determination as to whether an applicant was in a relevant institution and for what period of time my officials have commenced a process whereby those women are given the opportunity to meet with my officials and provide oral testimony about their time in an institution.  These meetings are proving to be informative and productive. </p>  <p>  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records or documents as well as the applicant's testimony.

Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.   </p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year. </p></reply>

The intention is to learn more about the most successful of these, share the learning across the programme and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services that provide the greatest contribution to good educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the review will be completed during this current academic year.</p></reply>

BreastCheck utilises digital mammography as it is the most advanced method available, giving enhanced image quality and significant reductions in the radiation dose associated with screening examinations. The improved images lead to higher detection rates for cancer which is seen as a positive. This facilitates earlier treatment of known cancers. Digital mammography does not play any part in causing these cancers.  <br/><br/>The National Cancer Registry (NCR)is the statutory body with responsibility for the collection and analysis of information relating to the incidence of cancer and related tumours in Ireland.<br/><br/>The interval cancer figures referred to were included in a 2012 report from the Registry: 'Breast Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival in Ireland: 1994-2009'.  This data refers to the number of interval cancers diagnosed in the period 2000-2009 for women aged 50-64 screened in the period 2000-2007. It should be noted that BreastCheck did not commence national roll-out until late 2007.<br/><br/>Breast cancer survival in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years due to a combined approach of screening, symptomatic detection and improved treatment. Breast cancer five year survival is estimated at 81% for people diagnosed between 2006-2011, which represents an increase from 72% for the diagnosis between 1994-1999.<br/><br/>Quality assurance processes and measurements are a vital aspect of the BreastCheck programme and their &lsquo;<i>Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening&rsquo;</i>are consistent with those of the European Reference Organisation for Quality Assured Breast Screening and Diagnostic Services which is the EU standard.<br/><br/>The overall benefits of breast screening are clear.  Breast screening helps to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage when it is easier to treat, thus exposing the women involved to less extensive surgical treatment and giving them better chances of good recoveries and improved quality of life.</p></reply>

The reason for allowing this period to elapse was to ensure that the Scheme had bedded in and that established trends would be available in order to inform the work of the Review. The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.<br/><br/>A call for written submissions to inform the review was made on the 16th June 2012. In total 61 submissions were received from a broad range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory bodies, groups representing the interest of older people, private/commercial bodies and organisations in the community and voluntary sector. A summary report of the submissions was published on the Department's website in December 2012. <br/><br/>The Terms of Reference for the Review are:<br/><br/>Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation:<br/><br/>1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme;<br/><br/>2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices;<br/><br/>3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services;<br/><br/>4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health); and<br/><br/>5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<br/><br/>The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time. This exercise is much broader than was first envisaged and the time needed was therefore also somewhat longer. However work is well  advanced and it is  expected that the Review will be completed by the end of this quarter .</p></reply>

Due to conflicting reports of posts being lost in these schools, my Department produced a report on the impact of the withdrawal of these legacy posts from DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 Schools. Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012 in the matter, a number of schools continued to retain disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes on a year to year basis and only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published in January 2014.<br/><br/>A range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced in 2012. As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment based, this determines whether schools gain or lose posts from year to year. <br/><br/>As the school referred to by the Deputy saw an increase in enrolment on 30th September 2013, the post was subsumed into the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2014/15 school year.  <br/><br/>The school submitted a staffing appeal to the February 2014 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The Appeals Board determined that the application did not satisfy all of the published criteria as set out in Circular 0007/2014.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

Individualised student information is already collected centrally at pre-primary, post-primary and third level education. The development of an individualised primary online database has been widely recognised for many years as being a key requirement to provide vital information on the educational welfare and progress of our primary school children. The current system of record keeping and data collection means that information provided to the Department from primary schools is quite out of date by the time it is eventually processed and passed to areas that need it such as the Inspectorate, School Governance, Forward Planning and various grant payment and teacher allocations areas. POD will allow the Department to have access to timely and relevant information about the stocks and flows of pupils in our primary schools, which will aid us tremendously in carrying out our functions and providing the best possible service to schools and pupils.  Moving to an electronic system will also help to streamline administration at school level and reduce form filling, red tape, and the duplication of information requests, allowing school staff to focus more on their primary objective of educating our children. <br/><br/>From the point of view of retaining the data up to the age of 30, the Department understands that there are concerns from a data protection and privacy point of view. The Department is considering these concerns but also needs to consider the fact that in the future POD will serve as the official record of primary school enrolment for everybody, and as such it forms part of an individual's personal history. While some people might prefer for their record to be deleted as soon as possible, others may prefer to have their record accessible should they want or need to get it in the future. The Department will consider it's retention policy bearing in mind these issues, as well as all the legal obligations on us in the areas of data protection and records management. Individuals also have the right under data protection legislation to request in writing to any public body that their records held by that body be removed or amended and their reasons for the request, and the public body must consider and respond to such requests within 40 days. <br/><br/>The Department takes the protection of pupil's data very seriously. Pupil data is stored securely in the Department's Oracle database. This database is hosted on the Department's servers which are located in the Revenue Commissioners data-centre in St Johns' Road. Access to the servers is protected by both Revenue and Government firewalls. Staff of the Revenue Commissioners do not have access to the data in the database. POD application roles have been developed which limit school staff to viewing and maintaining their own pupil records. Access within the Department to POD data is limited to the POD team which is currently less than 15 people. No agency or other Government Department will have direct access to the Primary Online Database.<br/><br/>The &quot;Notes&quot; area is for schools' use only, it will only be accessible to the school where the child is currently enrolled, and will not be transferrable from one school to the next if the child is moving school.  <br/><br/>School's have the option to enter data directly into POD. In general Schools have found the system user friendly.The encryption process is in place for data security reasons. A facility is also currently being rolled out which will allow schools to securely upload the data directly to the Department, so schools will have the option to use that if they are finding the encryption process difficult. <br/><br/>The Department has repeatedly advised parents and schools who have contacted us that if a parent does not wish to put their child's details on POD that they should inform their school of this in writing. We have not in any way advised schools to transfer data against the parent's wishes. <br/><br/>While this is a new system coming into place at primary level, it is already very common practice in many other areas of the public sector and indeed elsewhere in the education system for somebody accessing a public service to be asked to provide a certain amount of information about themselves in order to receive the service, including their PPS number.  In the education system, for example, in order to access the ECCE scheme parents must give a certain amount of information on their children to the pre-school in order to validate their eligibility, or in order to apply for and receive a student grant students must give information about themselves to the Department.  POD will also allow the Department to ensure that it makes payments on the basis of each pupil only once, with the best will in the world duplicate enrolments can inadvertently occur in the system. <br/><br/>Apart from the need to ensure that going forward payments and allocations to schools are made on the basis of validated information, from an administrative point of view, it would be unworkable to operate any kind of grant payments, allocation system or even to compile vital statistics if we have a system where some pupils are on POD and then there needs to be some alternate method of collecting information on pupils who do not provide their details to POD.  It's difficult to see how any such system could function in practice, either from the school's or Department's point of view. </p></reply>

There is no mechanism for separate payment and allocation to schools for pupils that are not on POD, and from a practical point of view it is difficult to see how much a system could work in practice.</p>  <p>  Under Section 12 of the Education Act 1998, the Minister of Education shall determine and publish the criteria in each school year by which funding shall be provided to schools in the following academic year. Over 3 billion euro of taxpayers money is spent annually on funding our primary school system. The vast majority of this funding is allocated to schools on the basis of reported pupil numbers. It is more than prudent from an audit and financial accountability point of view that we validate the data underlying these payments and ensure that payment is made only once in relation to each pupil. </p></reply>

In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Acts provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on-the-spot fine to an individual believed of committing a prescribed offence under the Act.  It is also open to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a litter warden under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997-2009 to issue a notice where an offence is believed to have been committed.  Local Authority Performance Indicators, including those pertaining to litter enforcement, are available at: .  However, there is no breakdown available that provides the level of detail sought.I am of the view that there are sufficient penalties in place and that the powers are conferred on appropriate personnel to deal with the issue of dog fouling when enforced under the Litter Pollution Acts and I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time.  I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but, ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.  </p></reply>

This requirement to respond to the Irish Water registration process is set out in the Water Services Act 2014, which also provides for the making of regulations that will set out the terms, conditions and eligibility criteria applying to the scheme, including the date by which a response to Irish Water&rsquo;s customer registration process will be required in order to be eligible for the grant.  I will be making these regulations in due course.  It is intended that the Department of Social Protection will manage the grant application process through an online interface. It is proposed that the grant will be paid in one instalment to all eligible households in September 2015 and on an annual basis thereafter.</p>  <p>  The water conservation grant replaces the tax rebate and social protection measures previously announced, as it is a more straightforward means of addressing water issues for all households on equal terms and will reduce households&rsquo; outlay on water services both now and in the future.</p>  <p>As the Department of Social Protection will administer the grant the process is streamlined and clearer for householders.  It is also important that all households have an equal chance to reduce their water consumption in their principal private dwellings.  This approach ha s a number of policy advantages as it makes water charges more affordable for lower income groups; conservation ensures a better use of our water resources and avoids unnecessary or premature expansion of water treatment plants; and it is   environmentally sustainable and protects our water environment which is to the benefit of all citizens.</p></reply>

Without such contributions, this servicing would not proceed or the full cost would have to be borne by the taxpayer.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, income from development levies must be ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, for roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces.   Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas.  The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, is therefore determined at local authority level in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this connection.</p>  <p>My Department issued statutory guidelines on development contributions to all planning authorities in January 2013.  These guidelines emphasise the importance of promoting development through the application, where feasible, of reduced development contributions to facilitate development and promote economic activity and job creation in local areas. With regard to small-scale redevelopment-type projects, the guidelines specifically require that planning authorities should include in their development contribution schemes provision that charges should only be applied on net additional development e.g. in respect of a redevelopment totalling 200 m ₂ of which 150 m ₂ is replacing existing development, a development contribution charge should only be levied on the additional 50 m ₂ .   </p>  <p>As Minister, I have a statutory role as consultee in the preparation of development contribution schemes under section 48 of the Planning Act.  My Department monitors the implementation of these guidelines, including the waiver mentioned above.  Where a proposed development contribution scheme of a planning authority is not in accordance with the guidelines, my Department has issued observations to the relevant planning authority and, under the terms of section 48(7) of the Act, the elected members are obliged to have regard to my recommendations in finalising their development contribution scheme.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the NBS contract was for a 5 year period and it expired in August 2014.  The expiry of the NBS contract has not resulted in any switch-off of services and there are now commercial options, in terms of access to basic broadband, available to consumers in NBS areas.  The Government is now focused on the provision of high-speed broadband services in rural parts of the country where commercial operators are unlikely to invest due to poor commercial returns.  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  This consultation will close on the 12th February next.  The map can be accessed at .  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016.  The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.  This includes Dring, Co Longford.<br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands throughout the entire country.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a 5 year period.<br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.

The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of its heat, and 10% of its transport, from renewable sources.  Figures for 2013 show that 20.9% of electricity demand was met from renewables.</p>  <p>  Ireland is regarded as a stable and favourable investment environment for renewable energy production, supported by a variety of policy initiatives including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) scheme.  The existing feed-in tariff is a very cost effective tool to support renewable energy production, as outlined in a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January.</p>  <p>  To date onshore wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  There is also potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio in the period to 2020 and beyond by realising the potential of our indigenous resources such as ocean, bioenergy and potentially solar energy.</p>  <p>  The cost effectiveness of support for renewables is a key consideration in the work now underway in my Department to consider the appropriateness and design of any new support scheme for renewable electricity.  Any scheme would be subject to EU rules on State Aid.  The commercial success of onshore wind means that we are now at the point where a gradual move to a more market based support for the technology is appropriate.  Taking account of developments in EU electricity market integration, my Department will be engaging with stakeholders in this work, a key component of which will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of any support required.</p></reply>

Oil use in electricity generation is negligible at less than 1 %.  The oil market in Ireland is completely liberalised, privatised and deregulated.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission monitors the oil market to ensure that the market is functioning well and that consumers are not being disadvantaged.  Both crude oil and refined oil products are very much globally traded commodities.  The EU&rsquo;s main role with regard to oil price developments is one of market monitoring.  There has been no major discussion at EU level about the fall in the price of oil being passed on to consumers.  The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which publishes a weekly Oil Bulletin with consumer prices of petroleum products in EU Member States, including Ireland.  The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve transparency and strengthen the internal market.  It contains tables with consumer prices in all 28 Member States, as well as separate euro-area and non-euro area tables and information on prices with and without taxes. </p>  <p>  It is evident from the EU's Oil Bulletin that prices are falling.  As of 26 January 2015, the price of petrol in Ireland was &euro;1.25 per litre including taxes and duties, while the price of diesel was &euro;1.19 per litre including taxes and duties.  In the same period last year, the price of petrol was &euro;1.53 per litre and the price of diesel was &euro;1.47 per litre.</p></reply>

I understand from the RSA that the majority of persons who fall into the category referred to by the Deputy, namely those who book a test well in advance of their test due date, will be offered a test date prior to the expiry of their current NCT certificate.  The RSA advise that any such customers who may find themselves with a test appointment beyond their test due date should contact the NCTS and request an earlier appointment and I am sure they will be accommodated.</p>  <p>  I also understand from the RSA that customers who require an early test are likely to receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  While it may be necessary to hold such a request on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found, in the majority of cases such customers are given a slot within the required timescale.</p>  <p>Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda&iacute; to use their discretion.

The Bremore proposal emerged from Drogheda Port Company's consideration of its statutory remit.  There is no issue <i>per se</i>with the fact that the physical location of what was the Bremore proposal lay outside the statutory harbour limits of Drogheda Port Company.  The Company spent a number of years engaged in the necessary feasibility and planning work which one would expect of a project of this scale.<br/><br/>However, in the intervening years since this proposal was first mooted, the economic and policy perspective has changed significantly.  It is important that, in the State commercial ports sector, bodies bringing forward significant port capacity developments have the resources required to ensure the State&rsquo;s and the public&rsquo;s interest is protected and enhanced.  National Ports Policy, published in 2013, outlines the Government&rsquo;s position that nationally significant port infrastructure projects should be led by the Ports of National Significance (Tier 1 and Tier 2) and that shareholder support for major port capacity developments will only be considered within that policy framework.</p></reply>

Given the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years.  The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work which could be undertaken.  For this reason it has not been possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years.  The scope for progressing new major road improvement projects will be very much dependent on the availability of funding in the future as the economy recovers further.</p>  <p>  In 2011 my predecessor indicated to the NRA that it should withdraw its application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the M20 Cork to Limerick route.  I understand Minister Varadkar was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe.  This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to the construction stage quickly.</p>  <p>Given continuing budget constraints and the need to focus on road maintenance and renewal, I do not currently plan to review this decision.</p></reply>
