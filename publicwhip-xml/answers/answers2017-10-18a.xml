The main purpose of the live firing shoot, which involved the firing of Defence Forces RBS 70 missiles, was to validate the training and capability of on island Ground Based Air Defence training.</p>  <p>  These RBS 70 missiles cannot be test fired on island due to firing range restrictions.  Participation in live firing practices adds to the Defence Forces capability in the area of Air Defence by practicing crews in live firing that is not possible to conduct at home. </p>  <p>  The live firing practice also had associated benefits in providing a nucleus of experienced personnel that can be employed in operations and pass on the benefit of this experience in the training environment.   </p>  <p>  The RBS 70 Surface to Air Missile System constitutes the principal element of the Defence Forces Ground Based Air Defence capability. A major upgrade of the system was completed in 2016 to allow it to meet current and future capability requirements. </p>  <p>  The upgrade, which was carried out by the original equipment manufacturer SAAB Dynamics AB, Sweden at a cost of &euro;4.1m ex VAT will ensure that the system will remain as a state of the art Ground Based Air Defence System into the future. </p>  <p>  The investment in the RBS 70 system is designed to counter threats in the air such as from unmanned aerial vehicles and aircraft. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to procure a new Ground Based Air Defence System for the Defence Forces.  However, the White Paper on Defence 2015 sets out that the Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In the event of additional funding becoming available beyond that required to maintain existing capabilities, additional air defence capabilities, such as ground to air weapons systems and ground to air radar surveillance systems are among the priorities identified.  In this regard, equipment priorities for the Defence Forces are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning process.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

The reviewer&rsquo;s report has indicated that he felt that given the breadth of the remit of the Terms of Reference he commented in general terms on the Defence Force safety regime.   </p>  <p>  It must be remembered that prior to the receipt of the disclosures, litigation had first been initiated in relation to the subject matter of the disclosures.  This therefore complicated the approach to be taken in developing any parallel process.  Notwithstanding this significant challenge, I put in place just such a parallel process.  In light of the legally complex situation, I believe it was appropriate that an experienced legal professional was appointed. </p>  <p>  It was the view of the independent reviewer that the Courts are best placed to examine issues in relation to allegations which were already subject to litigation.  This is so given the historic nature of the complaints, and, significantly, that it potentially affects the reputations and good names of individuals.  What the report shows is the difficulty in putting a parallel process to the courts in place.</p>  <p>  The report also notes that the Health and Safety Authority is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such allegations. </p>  <p>  I have furnished the report to those who made the protected disclosures and, before considering any further steps, I will await their views.</p>  <p>  Separately and in parallel to the independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) to improve its health and safety regime.  I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to-date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances.  Subject to completion of the improvement plan the HSA investigation is closed.  However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.</p></reply>

In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role.  The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.</p>  <p>  Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two relate specifically to the RDF i.e. attracting recruits from all backgrounds and conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a Specialist Reserve.  Over the course of the lifespan of the White Paper, other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will be examined and developed by the Defence Organisation. </p>  <p>  Recruitment to the RDF remains is ongoing in 2017.  A recruitment campaign to the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017.  1,221 applications to join the Reserve have been received of which 162 are female applicants.  There have been 98 inductions to the Army and Naval Service Reserve so far this year (82 Army Reserve and 16 Naval Service Reserve).</p>  <p>  The strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve (as of 31 August 2017) was as follows:</p>  <p> - Army Reserve: 1,789 effective personnel</p>  <p> - Naval Service Reserve: 127 effective personnel.</p>  <p>  Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing.  However, it is not possible at this point to indicate when the AR and the NSR establishment of 4,169 will realistically be achieved and I will keep this under review.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper on Defence.  </p></reply>

Patrick Gallagher, United States Marine Corps (RIP) who was killed in Vietnam on 30 March 1967.  The Defence Forces provided an Honour Guard, Musicians and Wreath Bearer Party consisting of 12 persons.  The Commemoration involved the participation of members of the US Marine Corps. </p>  <p>  On 12 May 2017, the Defence Forces participated in a ceremony in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin to mark the Unveiling of a number of Victoria Cross Stones by Minister Heather Humphreys and Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales.  The Defence Forces provided 22 persons consisting of an Honour Guard, Colour Party, Musicians, Wreath Bearer Party and a Master of Ceremonies.  The UK Military also participated in the ceremony with the provision of a Colour Party.   </p>  <p>  On 7 June 2017, the Defence Forces participated in two Ireland/UK joint wreath laying ceremonies in Messines, Belgium to mark the centenary of the Battle of Messines.  One ceremony took place at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Wijtschate and the second was at the Island of Ireland Peace Park.  The Defence Forces provided 15 persons consisting of a Colour Party, Musicians, Wreath Bearer Party, Chaplain, Reader and a Master of Ceremonies.  The UK Military were also involved in these ceremonies. </p>  <p>  On 30 July 2017, the Defence Forces participated in a Commemoration Ceremony in Ypres, Belgium to mark the centenary of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) and provided one Reader for the ceremony.  This event was organised by the UK authorities and readers from Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Germany also participated in the event.</p></reply>

While the full implications for the border will emerge during the course of the negotiations, it is this Government&rsquo;s stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.  From the defence perspective, the fact of a UK exit from the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border security requirements at this time.  On that basis, there is no particular emphasis on the Border region in the current recruitment campaign.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. </p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners on request.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review.  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place.</p></reply>

Non-Commissioned Officers or Privates filling appointments as Instrumentalists in the establishments of the Defence Forces School of Music may be granted 31 days annual leave and members of the Naval Service serving afloat may be granted annual leave of 43 days.  Members of the Defence Forces are entitled also to Public Holidays and to three specific military holidays. </p>  <p>  In addition, a wide variety of special leave is available to Defence Forces personnel such as mission leave when deployed abroad, special leave on return home from overseas deployment, certain NCOs and Privates qualify for special leave on extension of service and on termination of service subject to various requirements.  Certain Officers may be granted special leave prior to retirement.</p>  <p>  Defence Force Regulations (DFR) A.11 governs the granting of leave, other than sick leave, in the Permanent Defence Force.  As part of normal personnel management, the granting of annual leave is a balance between the entitlement of the individual to annual leave and the requirement to ensure continuity of a public service.  Paragraph 16 of DFR A.11 provides for the carry-forward of annual leave, not granted or availed of in the leave year concerned.  This can be of benefit both to the individual and the organisation.  Officers may be allowed to carry forward a maximum of 24 days, non-commissioned officers and privates in the Army and Air Corps, a maximum of 19 days and non-commissioned officers and ordinary or able seamen of the Naval Service, a maximum of 24 days. </p>  <p>  A request to increase the number of carry over days has been considered.  The current carry over has been found to be proportionate and reasonable.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by my officials that three plenary summonses have been taken by members of the Defence Forces in relation to the transposition of the Working Time Directive and the carryover of annual leave.  Given that these matters are before the Courts it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the legal proceedings which have been commenced in relation to this matter.   </p>  <p>  The implications of the Working Time Directive and its implementation, in respect of the Defence Forces under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, has been reviewed by the Department of Defence.  It is accepted that the current blanket exemption in respect of Defence Forces activities under the Act in implementing the Directive is no longer tenable.  My Department has recently concluded an audit of the activities of the Defence Forces, with a view to determining what activities may qualify for a derogation or exemption under the terms of the Directive.</p>  <p>  In November 2016, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation advised the Department that it received Government approval to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, insofar as it provides for a specific exclusion for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The responsibility for this legislation has recently moved to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and they are currently considering, in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, the most appropriate legislative method by which to bring about the necessary amendments.</p></reply>

Almost half of this figure, that is 205, were Recruits.  Discharge by Purchase is governed by Defence Forces Regulation A10, which sets out the payment scale in relation to such discharges.</p>  <p>  When assessing issues such as turnover of personnel, cognisance must be made of the fact that personnel leave for a variety of reasons and a significant number of recruits depart from the Defence Forces during the training phase.  This is not unique to the Irish Defence Forces and is to be expected as the recruitment phase offers the individual an opportunity to assess fully the realities of military life.  Turnover of personnel , in and of itself, is not a bad thing, as long as is it carefully managed and balanced with ongoing recruitment.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces; providing young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments.  To that end, the Defence Forces are working hard to maximise the recruit intake.  There is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  As the panel from the general service recruitment campaign held earlier this year has now been exhausted, a further recruitment campaign is under way with a closing date of the 27th October 2017.</p>  <p>  A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered. </p>  <p>  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is a welcome development.  I was particularly pleased with the deal that was negotiated between the Department of Defence, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA, which saw significant adjustments to the pay scales for post 2013 general service recruits and privates.  These pay increases have recently been applied.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to maximising recruitment to the Defence Forces and ensuring that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.</p></reply>

The re-organisation of the Defence Forces resulted in a fundamental restructuring of Army Formations and Units across the country including a number of operational posts.  This and previous barrack closures were undertaken in order to enhance operational readiness and deployability.  The re-organisation led to a re-configuration of operational processes, from a garrison-based system to a more flexible, deployable system that makes more efficient use of all resources, including personnel.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the military authorities that, for the most part, personnel are only deployed within their own Brigade area.  Occasionally, personnel from Donegal for example, have been deployed for security operations to other locations, including Dublin which is a key centre for large scale operations and ceremonial activity for the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  It is important that military personnel have experience of the full range of duties and of being part of a military force in a situation where they may be called upon to reinforce operations in different parts of the country.  This requires their deployment to locations where that experience can be gained. </p>  <p>  While efforts have been made to minimise impacts on individuals and families through retaining personnel in their Brigade area insofar as possible, it is essential that the military authorities have the capacity to deploy appropriate resources to wherever required in order to meet security and other taskings and it is my intention to retain this flexibility within the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management including, amongst others, pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance.<b></b>I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and I met with the Representative Associations on 13 July 2017, ahead of its official publication a week later.</p><p>I subsequently tasked civil and military management with examining the report and identifying those issues which are priorities.  While work to progress many of the issues was already underway as part of the implementation of the White Paper on Defence, I have directed that certain White Paper projects be brought forward and that work commence on these immediately. </p><p>I have directed civil and military management to initiate a broader view of contracts for enlisted personnel and to bring forward recommendations for my consideration.  I have also requested proposals in respect of retaining specialists, providing for re-entry and where appropriate, direct entry, for my consideration and I expect to be in receipt of these shortly.</p><p>The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel,<b></b>as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.  Targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place across the range of recruitment streams namely, general service, cadets, apprentices and direct entry officers.  The commencement of over 300 NCO promotions will be significant in terms of filling vacancies within the establishment, while providing career development opportunities for personnel. </p><p>The changes to the Recruit Training Syllabus referred to by the Deputy were made by the Military Authorities following a routine review, which identified elements of training being deemed more appropriate to a later stage within the development cycle of the enlisted soldier than heretofore had been the case.  Such reviews are intended to ensure that training syllabi remain efficient and effective.</p><p>I am satisfied that Defence Forces training continues to equip members of the Defence Forces to fully discharge the roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

This reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to defence and to our Defence Forces.</p><p>The 2018 pay allocation of some &euro;509 million provides for the pay and allowances for a full strength Permanent Defence Force of up to 9,500 personnel, 550 civilian employees and 350 civil servants. </p><p>The benefits to all employees from the budget will accrue to Permanent Defence Force personnel.  This includes reductions in the rates of the Universal Social Charge and an increase of &euro;750 in the income tax standard rate bands.</p><p>The rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Defence Forces are set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various parts of the public sector.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) agreement in March 2017.  The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Forces.  An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 and &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017.  An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. </p><p>The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, has been increased further following an agreement facilitated by the WRC between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA.  These improved payscales, have been backdated to 1 July 2016.  The payments were made to relevant personnel on 30 August 2017.</p><p>On completion of recruit and three star training newly qualified 3 star Privates and their Naval Service equivalent can expect minimum gross annual earnings of &euro;27,000 (inclusive of military service allowance).</p><p>Going forward, there is the potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:</p><p>- a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum</p><p>- a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and</p><p>- a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum. </p><p>The proposals have been presented to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process.  They are subject to ballot by members of the Associations. </p><p>Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will continue to be dealt with within this process.</p></reply>

The State Claims Agency manages claims on behalf of the Department of Defence and has confirmed that to date 56 claims have been made by members and former members of the Defence Forces who allege personal injury as a result of their consumption of mefloquine (Lariam).

Attendance by Defence Organisation personnel at such Defence exhibitions is standard practice and has been a feature at previous exhibitions.  It is best practice in Defence acquisition to carry out product and services research at major equipment shows of this nature. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the attendance of Department/ Defence Forces personnel at the event did not result in the signing of any new contracts for the procurement of services or products with particular suppliers in attendance at the exhibition.  In this regard, all procurement is carried out in accordance with guidelines laid down by Government and with the Directives of the European Union.  The purpose of the attendance of Department of Defence and Defence Forces personnel was to visit the many exhibition stands involving the wide range of companies that the Defence Organisation deals with on a regular basis.  These include companies involved in the land, sea and air environments, all of which are of interest to the Defence Organisation given the various roles of the Defence Forces at home and overseas.  It was also an opportunity for personnel to visit the stands of several Irish companies exhibiting.</p>  <p>  The exhibition provided personnel with a valuable opportunity to meet key suppliers across the full spectrum of military and defence equipment and activities.

However, this is not new and t he Defence Forces have always had a large turnover of approximately 500 personnel on an annual basis.  In the years between 2012 and 2016, discharges averaged some 581 annually.  Moreover, a certain level of turnover is, of course, desirable as a human resource and organisational objective in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation.</p>  <p>  Voluntary exit interviews of personnel of all ranks conducted by the Defence Forces indicate that the reasons for leaving range from economic factors to family circumstances, lifestyle and a desire for a change of career.</p>  <p>  To redress the balance of personnel turnover there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.</p>  <p>  In terms of pay, following sign up by PDFORRA to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, recent adjustments to salary scales will significantly benefit general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 13% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stablility Agreement 2018 -2020 also provides for further pay increases.  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development.  Further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold will also be paid under this Agreement.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a significant ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to maximising recruitment to the Defence Forces and ensuring that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.</p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and abroad.</p></reply>

The basis for the current structures was a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces which occurred in 2012 which led to the consolidation of three under-strength Army brigades into two full strength brigades.  A major re-organisation was necessary because it was clear that the three brigade structure was no longer viable, particularly when compared to international norms, and to achieve the most effective force in keeping with the stabilised establishment for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.  This required that an emphasis be placed on the consolidation of under-strength units into a smaller number of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated re-deployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.  These benefits will continue to be gained into the future.</p>  <p>  The decision to move to a two brigade structure involved full consultation with the Defence Forces, and was taken by the then Minister on foot of a joint recommendation made to him by the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff.   </p>  <p>  The subsequent White Paper on Defence, which was published in 2015, resulted from a comprehensive examination of Defence requirements over a ten year planning horizon and it specifically provides for the retention of the Army&rsquo;s two Brigade structure.  Accordingly, there are no plans to return to the previous structure. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that in order for 2 Brigade to execute its full range of operational, training and administrative tasks, Units based outside Dublin perform operational duties in Dublin on certain occasions each month.  The execution of such duties enhances situational awareness of the capital for all units.  These duties normally require the conduct of a wide range of familiarisation patrols throughout the greater Dublin area to 2 Brigade vital installations, and other Dublin based specific operational taskings.</p></reply>

Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members.  It encourages the early transfer of farms to younger generations and is mostly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief such as the Young Trained Farmer stamp duty exemption. </p>  <p>  Transitional arrangements for signed contracts would apply.

The restriction also applies whether a house is situated in Ireland or abroad and would include, for example, a holiday home.  Where two dwelling houses are inherited at the same time, the beneficiary can qualify for the dwelling house exemption on one of the houses only where he or she disclaims the interest in the other house. </p>  <p>  The reason for this restriction is that the exemption is designed to prevent hardship in cases where individuals are sharing a home and where one or more individuals are bequeathed the home in circumstances where they would otherwise have to sell the property in order to pay capital acquisitions tax and be left without a home.  It is considered that this situation does not arise when a beneficiary owns other residential property or properties.  On this basis I do not propose to change this condition of the relief.</p></reply>

For an individual working full-time on the minimum wage (i.e. 39 hours per week), this should result in an increase to gross income of &euro;608 per annum.  A single person on the current minimum wage, i.e. with annual employment income of &euro;18,759, pays income tax, PRSI and USC of &euro;883 per annum.  At the increased minimum wage of &euro;19,367, they will pay &euro;1,108 in tax in 2018.  This is an effective tax rate on gross earnings of just 5.72%.</p>  <p>  The marginal tax rate on the additional gross income exceeds the rate that might be expected of 26% (being 20% income tax, 2% USC and 4% PRSI) due to the tapered PRSI tax credit.  However, this is as a consequence of the exemption from PRSI which applies on lower incomes, and which is a factor in the very low effective tax rate which still applies on the increased gross income of a minimum wage worker.</p>  <p>  Prior to Budget 2015, a significant step effect existed in employee PRSI.  At that time, once an employee&rsquo;s earnings exceeded &euro;352 per week they became liable to 4% PRSI on all their income.  This resulted in an immediate additional payroll deduction of &euro;14.08, so an increase in gross pay of 1 cent could cause a fall in net income of &euro;14.07.  The employee&rsquo;s net income did not recover to pre-PRSI levels until gross earnings exceeded &euro;372 per week.</p>  <p>  This step effect was addressed in Budget 2016 by the introduction of a PRSI credit at the entry-point to employee&rsquo;s PRSI, which is tapered out as income increases.  The credit commences at income of &euro;352.01 per week, and tapers out at a rate of one-sixth of income in excess of this threshold.  The credit fully tapers out as income reaches &euro;424 per week.  The taper mechanism addresses the step effect while confining the benefit of the credit to earnings within the taper range.</p>  <p>  While the tapered withdrawal of the credit does result in a higher marginal rate of deduction on income within the taper band, this must be viewed in the context of the overall effective tax rate on the employee&rsquo;s total gross income of just 5.72%.  For comparison, a single person earning &euro;35,000, around the average wage, will have an effective tax rate of 17.5% in 2018.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this step effect, it should also be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s PRSI rates are low by comparison to personal and employer social insurance rates in other jurisdictions.</p></reply>

This scheme is underpinned by a lease and other legal agreements.  These provide that rental payments are made by the State over an agreed long-term time period, typically 20 years.  In return, the housing unit is made available for social housing purposes.</p>  <p>  Rental payments from Local Authorities to AHBs are classified as general government expenditure in accordance with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) and are recognised annually as the service (i.e. the rental properties) are made available annually throughout the contract.

The paper is the policy document which provides an overview of the concept of equality budgeting, the progress made in integrating equality budgeting into expenditure management and the estimates process, and the proposed next steps for the introduction of equality budgeting in Ireland.  The paper sets out the pilot approach that will be adopted for gender budgeting in the Budget 2018 budgetary cycle anchored in the performance budgeting framework.  The next step in this process will be the publication of objectives and indicators for the pilot policy areas in the Revised Estimates Volume in December. </p>  <p>  The paper follows the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  This is also a commitment that has been included in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments, (SCPA).  Every child therefore has access to educational psychological assessment services either through the NEPS or SCPA psychologist.</p><p>NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p><p>I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS office. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  Delivery on this commitment is underway in 2017 with an additional eleven NEPS psychologists recruited or in the process of being recruited currently.  Additionally my Department, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service (PAS) has from established regional recruitment panels, been engaged throughout the year in securing recruits to fill vacancies in the NEPS psychologist posts due to ongoing retirement, resignations, etc. </p><p>I attach for the Deputy&rsquo;s information detail of the NEPS psychologist staffing numbers from 2009/10 to date as well as recruitment in train and in prospect in this regard.  By way of clarification I would inform the Deputy that NEPS psychologists are assigned across eight Regions and sited in 23 offices countrywide but not on a county basis.</p><p>NEPS staffing numbers currently stand at a level which is higher than any stage since the service was established in 1999 and are due to rise further with the immanent recruitment detailed therein.</p><p>My Department remains committed to the continued support of NEPS and the valuable services it provides our schools and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an additional ten educational psychologists will be provided to NEPS in 2018.</p><p>Number of NEPS Psychologists by academic year - 2009/10 to date<table><tr><th>Academic Year</th><th>Nep Psych Count</th><th>Full E.W.T No. Of Psychologists (1)</th></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>153</td><td>146.9</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>165</td><td>158.9</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12</td><td>173</td><td>166</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>171</td><td>168.8</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>177</td><td>168.1</td></tr><tr><td>2014/15</td><td>177</td><td>166.9</td></tr><tr><td>2015/16</td><td>175</td><td>164.99</td></tr><tr><td>2016/17</td><td>171</td><td>161.2</td></tr><tr><td>2017/18 (current date)</td><td>185</td><td>174.7</td></tr><tr><td>- by End November 2017  (^)</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>- Confirmed but no Start Date (#)</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>- Starting in 2018 (&amp;amp;)</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>- With PAS (*)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>195</td><td>184.7</td></tr></table>Notes:</p><p>- Staffing Numbers for previous year are taken at 1st January of that year</p><p>- (^)  Recruits have agreed start dates.</p><p>- (#) The public appointments service has recently processed these recruits and referred them on to the Department's HR Unit for contract negotiations and formal offer.

To date eleven new apprenticeships have been developed by the Council.  During 2016 two new programmes got under way in Insurance Practice and Industrial Electrical Engineering.  This year has seen the commencement of new apprenticeships in Polymer Processing Technology, Manufacturing Technology, Manufacturing Engineer, Accounting Technician and two programmes in International Financial Services (Associate &amp;amp; Specialist). </p><p>Apprenticeships in Commis Chef and two ICT apprenticeships (Network Engineer and Software Developer) have recently been validated and are currently approving employers and recruiting apprentices and are expected to get underway shortly. </p><p>Further new apprenticeships are to be submitted for validation to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) shortly and, subject to successful validation, it is expected that a further four new schemes will get underway later this year in various sectors including Engineering and Haulage.</p><p>Earlier this year we published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 which sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how we will achieve the commitments in the Action Plan for Education in this area.</p><p>A key commitment for this year set out in the Plan was the issuing of a second call for apprenticeship proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call.  The second call closed on the 1 September with 77 proposals received from a range of sectors and occupations.  The Apprenticeship Council is currently evaluating these proposals and will report its findings in November. </p><p>Budget 2018 made a provision of &euro;122m for apprenticeship training for next year.  This represents an increase of almost 24% over the 2017 allocation and will support an apprentice population which is forecast to be in excess of 13,000 by the end of 2017 and new registrations which are forecast to be over 6,000 during 2018.  As set out in the Plan we have targeted a further ten new schemes for 2018 which will bring the total new apprenticeships to 25, almost doubling the number of apprenticeship schemes on offer in Ireland.</p><p>Apprentice Population 2017 by Sector and Trade as 30/9/17<table><tr><th>Construction Total</th><th>2692</th></tr><tr><td>Brick and Stonelaying</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Cabinet Making</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Carpentry and Joinery</td><td>1050</td></tr><tr><td>Floor and Wall Tiling</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Painting and Decorating</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Plastering</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Plumbing</td><td>1211</td></tr><tr><td>Stonecutting and Stonemasonry</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Wood Manufacturing and Finishing</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>Wood Machinist</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical Total</td><td>5058</td></tr><tr><td>Aircraft Mechanics</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical</td><td>4185</td></tr><tr><td>Electrical Instrumentation</td><td>292</td></tr><tr><td>Electronic Security Systems</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>Instrumentation</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Refrigeration</td><td>271</td></tr><tr><td>Engineering Total</td><td>1742</td></tr><tr><td>Farriery</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Insulation</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>M.A.M.F.</td><td>590</td></tr><tr><td>Metal Fabrication</td><td>654</td></tr><tr><td>*Pipefitting</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Sheet Metalworking</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Toolmaking</td><td>243</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Total</td><td>2334</td></tr><tr><td>Agricultural Mechanics</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td>Construction Plant Fitting</td><td>238</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy Vehicle Mechanics</td><td>509</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Mechanics</td><td>1279</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicle Body Repairs</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Printing &amp;amp; Paper Total</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Print Media</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Priniting</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Bookbinding</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>11844</td></tr></table>*Please note: From end of 2016 Pipefitting is included in the Engineering Family of Trade.</p><p>Consortia Led Apprenticeships Total 2016/2017 @ 30 September 2017<table><tr><th></th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Industrial Electrical Eng</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Engineering (Level 6)</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Engineering (Level 7)</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Polymer Processing Tech</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Accounting Technician</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance Practice</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>International Financial Services Associate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>International Financial Services Specialist</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>Total consortia led</td><td>282</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total (All)</td><td>12,126 </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th>Apprentice Registrations</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017 (as of end September 2017)</th></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,698</td><td>3,153</td><td>3,821</td><td>3,478</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ireland attaches importance to combating all forms of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity and we strongly believe that consensual, same-sex relationships should not be criminalised.</p>  <p>  Our commitment to LGBTI rights is delivered through our engagement at international human rights fora, notably at the UN and EU, as well as through our bilateral relations, in cases we believe that this can be helpful or effective. </p>  <p>  Ireland co-sponsored the milestone UN Human Rights Council resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) in 2011.

During this period we consistently highlighted discrimination against LGBTI persons and worked with other countries to ensure that this issue is now firmly embedded in the work of the HRC.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to prioritise the promotion and protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systemic discrimination in many countries.</p></reply>

As I have stated before in this House, the ongoing fighting in Libya exacerbates the situation for migrants.  The government has only partial control of the territory, which limits the capacity of the international community to ensure accountability for these alleged abuses.</p>  <p>  I know the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is working in extremely difficult conditions to provide assistance to the refugees and migrants in Sabratha.  I commend their work, and I am glad that Ireland is able to provide core funding to UNHCR, in support of their global efforts.</p>  <p>  I know that conditions in many detention centres are appalling, and I strongly condemn all human rights violations and abuses against refugees and migrants.  At the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council, Ireland expressed deep concern at the conditions experienced by migrants in detention centres in Libya.  EU Foreign Ministers also adopted Council Conclusions in July, which urge the Libyan authorities to improve humanitarian access to and conditions in detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention.  </p>  <p>  The EU has a number of practical initiatives which provide assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in Libya, in particular inside detention centres.  The EU also provides training (including in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues) and other support to enhance the border management capacities of the Libyan authorities.  The EU supports the work of UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), to ensure that there are adequate reception facilities for migrants. </p>  <p>  In September, officials from my Department met with the organisation referenced by the Deputy to discuss the human rights situation in Libya, in particular in detention centres.  A return to stability and an end to lawlessness in Libya is crucial to ensuring an end to these terrible abuses, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p>  <p>  A step-change in improving the situation of migrants in Libya requires political stability and a return of security, through the formation of a functioning government and a return to order throughout the country.  Through the EU, Ireland both supports UN mediation and regional efforts in pursuit of stabilisation in Libya.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, which has a focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under-nutrition, is also contributing to improving conditions of life in countries of transit and origin for migrants.</p></reply>

The Government has emphasised to all parties the urgent need to reach an agreement to move ahead with the establishment of the Stormont House legacy framework, which victims and survivors continue to wait for delivery of, having had to wait for far too long already for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland for dealing with legacy issues from the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The next step in relation to the legacy institutions is expected to be a public consultation by the British Government on their draft legislation to establish the legacy bodies provided for in the Stormont House Agreement.  Legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for cooperation with the Stormont House legacy bodies.  The preparation of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and the Oireachtas is being advanced by the Department of Justice and Equality and my Department. </p>  <p>  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent move forward on legacy issues, to establish the Stormont House framework, meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors, and contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

This document set out key aspects of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach, including that any future Free Trade Agreement with the UK should promote regulatory conformity, ensure ways to manage potential regulatory divergence, and impose the disciplines needed in order to ensure a level playing field.  Such an agreement should also include a robust dispute resolution mechanism and associated enforcement process, and these or similar mechanisms will also be necessary to ensure that agreed rules and undertakings in other areas are honoured<font color="#004080">.</font>Future tariff arrangements will be a key focus, as will the need to minimise any burdens of customs or transit costs.

It was noted in the published Budget Day estimate for 2018 for the Garda Vote that a proportion of the estimate for some items, including the subhead to which the Deputy refers is now reflected in a new subhead for the Garda College.  This has led to the reallocation of certain costs between subheads in 2018 compared with 2017.  This will be apparent in the more detailed subhead information to be published in the Revised Estimates Volume later in the year but I can inform the Deputy that the allocation for the Garda College is in the region of &euro;30.5 million.</p>  <p>  A total budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been provided to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na in 2018, an increase of 2% on 2017.  It should be noted that the Garda allocation substantially continues to benefit from the significant additional funding that was provided in 2016, and maintained in 2017, to fund the sustained response to tackle gangland crime, fund the continuation of Operation Thor and ensure that measures to prevent international terrorism can be continued.</p>  <p>  The training costs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are an intrinsic part of the overall allocation, which are absorbed throughout the Garda Vote whether in the payroll costs of the personnel providing the training or the travel and subsistence costs of members travelling to regional centres for in-service training etc.  The vast bulk of training to members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na is provided internally by suitably qualified personnel.</p>  <p>  It is the case that the training requirement will even grow further over the next couple of years to correspond with the increase in personnel in the organisation as well as the deployment of new ICT systems underpinning the unprecedented level of investment under the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.  This requirement will be kept under review with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the three strands of the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Roscommon/Longford Division, on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 305 with 9 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division.  The Athlone, Mullingar and Moate Garda stations form part of the Westmeath Division.  The strength of the Westmeath Division on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 267 with 13 Reserves and 23 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide with 10 and 27 being assigned to the Roscommon/Longford and Westmeath Divisions respectively.  I am also informed that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Roscommon/Longford and the Westmeath Divisions in the coming years. </p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the table, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of garda&iacute; assigned to the Roscommon/Longford and the Westmeath Garda Divisions as of 31 August 2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available. </p><p>Strength of the Roscommon/Longford Division 31 August 2017<table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>CASTLEREA</td><td>BALLAGHADERREEN</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINLOUGH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BOYLE</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEREA           </td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ELPHIN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FRENCHPARK</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KEADUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROOSKY</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STROKESTOWN</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULSK</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>GRANARD</td><td>DRUMLISH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EDGEWORTHSTOWN</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRANARD</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SMEAR</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>BALLYMAHON</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KENAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LANESBORO           </td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LONGFORD</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>ATHLEAGUE           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONARK</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROSCOMMON           </td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON / LONGFORD TOTAL</td><td></td><td>305</td></tr></table></p><p>Strength of the Westmeath Division 31 August 2017<table><tr><th>DIVISION</th><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>ATHLONE</td><td>ATHLONE</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYMORE           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLASSON</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILBEGGAN           </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOATE</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>MULLINGAR</td><td>BALLYNACARGY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEPOLLARD</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DELVIN</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLUCAN</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINNEGAD</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLINGAR           </td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULTYFARNHAM</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROCHFORTBRIDGE</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH TOTAL</td><td></td><td>267</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Much of the Act was commenced on 27th March 2017 and work is ongoing to ensure that the remaining sections of the Act are commenced as soon as practicable.</p>  <p>  Due to the recent enactment of the Bill, the operational needs of adapting crime recording systems to record new crimes, and the standard for statistical reports to be produced a number of months after the period recorded, statistics are as yet unavailable. </p>  <p>  I believe that support for victims of crime is essential.  To that end, a number of offices within my Department provided funding to organisations supporting victims of crime.  So far, in 2017, the Victims of Crime Office has allocated funding of just over &euro;1.7m to organisations supporting victims of crime, &euro;209,000 of which went to organisations supporting victims of sexual crime.  This was augmented by funding from Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, who provided &euro;40,000 towards supports for victims of sexual crimes.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in my Department has also provided &euro;260,000 to date in 2017 to Ruhama.  Ruhama deals primarily with women affected by prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy also that I expect the Victims of Crime Bill 2015, which will give legislative effect to the EU Victims Directive, to complete its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming days. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-18a.250.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101800067#WRE03500"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. </p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. </p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor. </p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 83,260 targeted checkpoints and 61,580 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 5,540 arrests and 6,150 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. </p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>Furthermore, I recently announced that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate at the Scheme can find more details at www.muintiir.ie. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government is pursuing its plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits, up to 500 civilians and approximately 300 members of the Garda reserve.  These appointments will support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and benefit policing services for all communities, whether in rural or urban areas.</p></reply>

It was introduced in November 2012 based on a model recommended by the late Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly.  The system is categorised according to the nature and seriousness of the complaint.  This can range from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a Category D complaint.  A complaint in the 'A' category, such as assault,  is examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  A complaint in the 'D' category would relate to maladministration by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.  </p>  <p>  The late Judge Reilly, who was independent of Government in his post of Inspector, carried out a review of this system in June 2016  and made a number of recommendations.  This report entitled &ldquo;Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure&rdquo; is available on my Department's website - www.justice.ie.   </p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report is that prisoners&rsquo; complaints should be subject to review by the Ombudsman, who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  This recommendation was accepted and my officials and officials from the Irish Prison Service are in advanced discussions with the Ombudsman's office with the aim of establishing an effective complaints system for prisoners.  Further measures recommended in the Inspector's report need to be in place - such as development of the necessary IT infrastructure - before the Irish Prison Service will be in a position to implement the revised procedures.  Some amendment to secondary legislation may be required as well but it is not envisaged that primary legislation will be required.</p>  <p>  The revision of the prisoner complaints system is not directly linked to the ratification of the UN's Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT).  Preparatory work on this ratification has been on-going for some time.  At the end of 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality initiated a consultation process with civil society on the ratification of the Protocol in Ireland.  Following an open policy debate including with NGOs, the academic community as well as statutory agencies, the Department circulated a revised consultation paper.  This process was concluded in May 2017 and the contributions made will inform the development of a General Scheme for the Inspection of Places of Detention Bill, which will include provisions to ratify OPCAT.  </p>  <p>  Among the suggestions made by respondents was that a full scoping exercise be carried out on how OPCAT would operate across the various places of detention in the State.  This involves consultations with a number of Government Departments which are already underway.  The Department is also continuing its engagement with those who contributed submissions on the matter, building on the scoping work already initiated and in particular, the research carried out by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  All this work is informing the drafting of the General Scheme of the Inspection of Places of Detention Bill.  When the draft legislation is sufficient advanced, I will seek Government approval of the Heads of a Bill.  Subject to this approval, the Bill will then be submitted to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny and the other necessary steps before the Bill becomes law.</p></reply>

The report of the PPRG titled &lsquo;Strategic Review of Penal Policy&rsquo; dated July 2014 was published on my Department's website ().  In November 2014, the report of the Group was submitted to Government, one of the recommendations of which was that an implementation and oversight mechanism should be set up.  </p><p>The Implementation and Oversight Group was established in early 2015, to oversee implementation of the PPRG&rsquo;s recommendations.  Its primary function is to meet and report to the Minister, on a six monthly basis, on the implementation status of the recommendations of the PPRG.  The Group has submitted four reports on progress to date.  Three reports are currently available on my Department's website and the fourth report will be published shortly.  These reports outline the timelines expected for the implementation of each recommendation made by the Penal Policy Review Group and the current implementation status of each of those recommendations.</p><p>The PPRG report identified 43 recommendations for reform of penal policy and this currently forms the blueprint for penal reform to which I am fully committed.  Progress has been made in terms of some of the recommendations of the PPRG - for example, the pursuit of alternatives to custody, interagency working between the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service and the use of structured temporary release programmes such as the Community Return Programme and the Community Support Scheme.</p><p>Recommendation 31 of the Report was that a Parole Board should be established on a statutory footing with the power to make decisions on sentences.</p><p>Following the publication of the report work commenced on a General Scheme of a Bill on the establishment of a Parole Board on a statutory basis.</p><p>In April 2017, the Government agreed to focus on the Private Members Parole Bill 2016 that had been brought forward by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan and to work in partnership with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan to achieve this objective.  It was also agreed that appropriate amendments to the Bill would be brought forward in consultation with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan.  The Bill passed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24 April 2017 and work on preparing amendments for Report Stage is ongoing. </p><p>The Bill provides for establishing a Parole Board on a statutory basis to determine releases from prison of long sentence offenders.  The Bill sets out the criteria to be considered in deciding on the release of prisoners, which include risk to public safety and the extent to which release will facilitate the prisoner&rsquo;s reintegration into society. </p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-18a.318.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101800068#WRF04500"><p>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the eHealth related telehealth and teleconsultations services that are remotely delivered using online means as opposed to a traditional face-to-face consultation.  </p><p>The importance of, and the opportunity for, eHealth or digital health to support health care reform and the delivery of a modern health care system has been recognised for quite some time.  In 2013, my Department published an eHealth strategy, which outlined a way forward to improve the deployment of information technology to support health care efficiency and patient safety and care. </p><p>There has been some progress made since the publication of the strategy including the establishment of the Office of the Chief Information Officer and eHealth Ireland, the publication of the Knowledge and Information Plan, the establishment of the eHealth ecosystem, the development of the Electronic Health Record business case and the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier (IHI).</p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare report advocates the <i>&ldquo;Continued strong support of the e-health strategy&quot; </i>and in particular ensuring the necessary funding for the timely roll-out of an EHR system.  The report also emphasised the importance of health information and eHealth as critical enablers to implement the change required to deliver an integrated, high quality health system. </p><p>The delivery of eHealth in Ireland effectively means the digital transformation of a healthcare model that exploits digital infrastructure to enable commonly shared capabilities and access to services and information throughout the health system.  eHealth has the capacity to provide the enabling infrastructure and the technology needed to facilitate the wider use of technology to support patient care in any health care setting.  New technologies facilitate different approaches to the treatment of patients, offering alternative health care models of integrated care that can contribute to better outcomes and achieve cost efficiencies in the delivery of health services.  </p><p>There is emerging evidence that telemedicine/teleconsultation can be implemented to support an integrated healthcare approach.  Teleconsultations can provide benefits in certain circumstances, such as the provision of care in remote locations or for chronically ill patients and provide care in alternative settings convenient for the patient.  Such consultations, as currently available, can provide alternative channels of service to enhance patient choice.  Where these services are offered they must support current best clinical practice and patient safety care protocols and should only be provided where direct patient access on a face to face basis is not readily available or suitable.  In delivering remote health services, providers must also ensure the integrity of patient data, as required by current data protection law and the forthcoming implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation in May 2018.  There will also be a need for guidance and clinical protocols around the appropriate use of teleconsultations to be developed as well as retraining and education of staff and patients.</p><p>While my Department is aware that some general practitioners and providers are offering video and online services these are in general enhancements and alternatives to current provision of existing services.  Any deployment of telemedicine/teleconsultation in primary or other care settings must be provided on the basis of ensuring that the same level of care and treatments as are also available from non digital based services.  While some teleconsultation solutions are currently being offered in the private health sector, GPs are private contractors and my Department does not routinely collect information on teleconsultation services that may be offered by particular GPs or private companies.  This emerging area of service provision will be closely monitored by my Department.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of public funding and AHR treatment, I intend to revert to Government by the end of this year with proposals for a potential model of public funding for AHR treatment for the Government's consideration and decision.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the Health Research Board's (HRB) evidence review of international public funding models for AHR was published earlier this year.  This evidence review examines the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  An analysis of the HRB evidence review will feed into the development of policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment by my officials.  This policy options paper will be presented to me by the end of this year and I will then submit these proposals to Government.  It is important to note that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010.  The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.  Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017.  This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months.  No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/lymedisease/. </p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  </p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  As testing in Ireland is confirmed by the RIPL there is no requirement to send samples to other facilities in the UK.</p></reply>

Unenclosed land is usually found in upland areas and is generally less fertile than enclosed or improved land found at lower elevations.  There is compelling evidence surrounding the difference in productivity of tree species planted on unenclosed and enclosed land.  This measure became known as &lsquo;the 20% rule&rsquo;.  The 20% rule had an effect on increasing the average production potential of sites being put forward for afforestation, as it stipulates that each site required 80% enclosed and improved land.  It also acted as a means of reducing the amount of environmentally sensitive land being submitted, as much of the poorer land is environmentally sensitive.</p>  <p>  To better inform the discussion on these issues, the Department produced two documents, the first related to productivity assessment informed by Teagasc research and the second related to environmental sensitivities following a consultation process.  </p>  <p>  The new Land Types for Afforestation document was launched in March 2016 and introduced a new approach to land classification for bare land.  It is based on scientific work centred on the scoring of vegetation from a productivity perspective.  The use of ground vegetation to assess the suitability of land is a long established method of assessing the suitability of sites for afforestation and as an aid to tree species selection.  A range of indicator values has been derived for plants found in the UK and Ireland.  There is a strong relationship between the combined R (Reaction) and N (Nitrogen) value and site productivity.  Using this new system to evaluate site productivity, plants are given combined R+N values and are then weighted by their occurrence to get an overall plot average.  Higher values are associated with more fertile sites.  This new approach to classifying bare land for planting and the new Environmental Requirements launched in December 2016 are now being implemented.</p>  <p>  Given that we are now successfully implementing the two documents referred to above, we now intend lifting the 20% rule.  My Department is now engaging with the European Commission with the aim of removing the 20% rule and has met with DG ENVIRON and DG AGRI in December 2016.  A final position has yet to be reached by the Commission and a further meeting with the Commission is scheduled for November 2017.</p>  <p>  While I am not aware of all the rules of all Member States, each Member State that grant aids afforestation must apply minimum environmental requirements as set out in REGULATION (EU) No 1305/2013 on support for rural development and in the EU&rsquo;s Guidelines for State aid in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas.</p></reply>

Sprat is a short-lived species and an important prey fish for many marine species thus vital to the ocean food chain as well as an important source of income for inshore fishermen.</p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.  Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of the seabirds and marine life around our coast through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments.</p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  Scientifically, relatively little is known about the sprat species.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock. </p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.  The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.  That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there.</p>  <p>  In order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, commenced in October 2014 and is now in its final stage, under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem.  This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute is  committed to working closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage in the sprat fisheries.  A number of such observer trips have already taken place this month with more planned.  The purpose of the observer scheme is twofold: </p>  <p> - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, ie herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.</p>  <p> - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that these projects/observer schemes will allow for more intensive data collection and enhanced scientific knowledge on the sprat stock thus supporting any future management actions considered necessary including the issue of pair trawling. </p></reply>

The Map is searchable by eircode.</p><p>-  The BLUE areas on the Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering, or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services  </p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of a procurement process. </p><p>Individuals can access the High Speed Broadband Map www.broadband.gov.ie using their eircode to ascertain the colour code (BLUE for commercial or AMBER for the State Led Intervention) status for their premises.</p><p>The map shows that the townland of Shrule, Co Mayo comprises 101 premises and broadband coverage will be realised  through a mix of predominantly commercial investment and the State led Intervention under the NBP.  Of the 101 premises, 99 premises fall within areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering, or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The remaining 2 premises will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  </p><p>With regard to the State led Intervention, my Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network.  A significant milestone in that procurement process was reached last month with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and ultimate progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s).  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy for the network build on conclusion of this process.</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the roll out of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for rollout and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers.  These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

It functions as part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in the UK. </p>  <p>  As regards the role played by CAR in enforcing passenger rights in Ireland following the recent announcement by Ryanair of the cancellation of a number flights, I am aware that the CAR has been working directly with the airline since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the Regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.  </p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that it had secured a commitment from Ryanair that it will fully comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation.  It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.  I am satisfied with the approach adopted by CAR in dealing with this matter.</p>  <p>  It is noted that Ryanair recently replied to correspondence received from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and has agreed to meet its requirements for clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s obligations under Regulation 261/2004, which are in line with those requested by the CAR. </p>  <p>  With regard to the regulation of aviation safety, the Irish Aviation Authority is responsible for safety regulation, oversight and inspection and ensures that all Irish airlines continue to be fully compliant with European aviation safety regulations.  In that context, it is important to acknowledge that the IAA is a high performing regulator, whose safety oversight and inspection regime is subject to rigorous international, independent audit, which consistently confirms it amongst the very best aviation regulatory bodies.</p></reply>

As I have previously outlined to the Deputy, this includes a multi-annual capital envelope of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme.  This significant funding will enable us to put in place the kind of bus system that is needed to cater for Ireland&rsquo;s future economic growth and growing transport needs, with high quality infrastructure and services, coupled with major improvements in ticketing and information, all providing a modern, faster, reliable, convenient and attractive public transport solution.</p></reply>

This budgetary measure specifically targeted children in low-income families, and as such should assist in the goal of lifting such children out of poverty.</p><p>The measure should not be looked at in isolation.  It is one of the three main child income support payments available to families, alongside Child Benefit and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.  This increase brings the combined payment for children to almost &euro;66 per child per week.  Altogether, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will spend in excess of &euro;3 billion in 2017 providing income support for families through Child Benefit, qualified child increases for welfare recipients, Family Income Supplement and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p><p>Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality and Ireland is among the best performing countries in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers.  But income supports cannot provide all the solutions.  While protecting children and young people from poverty and social exclusion is about ensuring that they have adequate income and resources, it is also about ensuring that they can live in decent houses, have access to good quality education and health-care, and have every opportunity necessary to develop and to participate as equals in society.  It is also about helping unemployed families to take-up work and to improve the rewards from work.  Government employment policies, such as <i>Pathways to Work</i>and the <i>Action Plan on Jobs</i>, along with increases in minimum wage and income supports such as the Family Income Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend, both of which have been improved in Budget 2018, are clearly working in this regard.</p><p>Under the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures framework, a whole of Government approach to tackling child poverty has just been published, which recognises the crucial importance of services such as childcare, housing, and education.  It is through this whole of Government approach, which emphasises the need for a combined approach of both income supports and provision of services, that we can find the key to tackling child poverty in Ireland. </p></reply>

The SIF operates under the terms of the Social Welfare (Consolidation Act) 2005.  Under section 9 of that Act the SIF comprises a current account managed by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and an investment account managed by the Minister for Finance.  The income of the SIF derives mainly from the pay-related social insurance collected by the Revenue in respect of employers and employees and self-employer persons.  The accounts of the SIF are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p><p>Social insurance benefits, redundancy payment entitlement and occupational injury benefits are paid out of the SIF at rates established by the Social Welfare Acts.  In the course of the administration of the schemes, overpayments arise which are assessed and become a debt to the Department.  Debts arise when benefits are paid in excess of entitlement due to fraud, customer or official error.  The Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing.  </p><p>The historic outstanding customer debt balance, due in respect of the SIF, at the end of 2016 was &euro;89 million in respect of 48,422 individual debts.

These measures were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing them with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  Should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment participate on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;193 which is the maximum personal rate for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and this payment will be increased to &euro;198 in March 2018.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring my Department continues to identify effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.  </p><p>As part of Budget 2018 I announced the introduction of the youth employment support scheme (YESS) which is targeted at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face barriers to employment.  This new work experience programme aims to provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Participation in the scheme will be completely voluntary, and participants will receive the equivalent of a net minimum wage payment.  The details of the new scheme are still being finalised, but I expect to launch it in quarter two of next year.</p></reply>

The number of young people experiencing consistent poverty rose sharply in these years &ndash; reflecting increased youth unemployment, and, more significantly, increased unemployment among the parents of young adults who were mainly still studying and living at home.  Some improvement was already visible by 2015; the at-risk-of-poverty rate (before social transfers) and the deprivation rate for young people fell in both 2014 and 2015.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, the effects of the recovery have become increasingly visible since 2015.  Unemployment has fallen from 10.2% at the beginning of 2015 to 6.1% in September of this year.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  Given this continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and 2017 and the measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, I expect the poverty and deprivation figures for those years, when they become available, to show significant further improvement over the 2015 out-turn.</p>  <p>  I also expect further improvement as the economy continues to recover.  My Department continues to implement the Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020 Strategy which focuses on ensuring jobseekers, including young people, can access good quality work, training and education opportunities.  It prioritises the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices.  Poverty is strongly linked to unemployment, and as employment increases, we can expect to see decreases in poverty and deprivation. </p>  <p>  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery.  Budget 2018 included an increase of &euro;5 per week for Jobseekers aged under 26 and introduced the Youth Employment Support Scheme which is focused on helping young long-term jobseekers, aged 18 to 24 years, back to work and will be rolled out in 2018.  There were also increases in the qualified child rate for children up to the age of 18 years (and up to 22 years for those in school/college) and in the Working Family Payment (formerly known as Family Income Supplement).  The Back to Work Family Dividend has also been extended.  These will positively impact on the lives of young people, and the households they live in.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s overall strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  My Department is reviewing the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The 2015 SILC results show that even now we have a long way to go to achieve the national social target for poverty reduction.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.</p></reply>

The draft Bill has a particular focus on low-paid, more vulnerable workers.  It provides for five key issues:</p><p>- Ensuring that employees are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and in particular their core terms at an early stage of their employment.</p><p>- Strengthening the provisions around minimum payments to low-paid, vulnerable workers who may be called in to work for a period but not provided with that work.</p><p>- Prohibiting zero hours contracts in most circumstances. </p><p>- Ensuring that workers on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week than provided for in their contracts of employment, are entitled to be placed in a band of hours that better reflects the reality of the hours they have worked over an extended period.</p><p>- Strengthening the anti-victimisation provisions for employees who try to invoke a right under these proposals.</p><p>The draft legislation takes account of the University of Limerick (UL) study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts and the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation on the UL study, conducted by the former Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Furthermore, the draft legislation has also been subject to a detailed dialogue process with ICTU and Ibec over a period of several months. </p><p>The Bill is currently being drafted and it is my intention to publish the Bill before the end of the year subject to Government approval.</p></reply>

The ESRI found that sub-minima rates of a similar nature are in use in a significant number of OECD countries.

The report also indicated that there is no evidence of significant abuse when it comes to the application of sub-minima rates. </p>  <p>  Given that the remit of the Low Pay Commission is to make its recommendations using an evidence-based approach, the Commission had agreed with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in early 2016 the inclusion, on a pilot basis, of a specific question on the national minimum wage, and the use of sub-minima rates, in the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) series.  The Commission indicated in its 2016 report that it would await the availability of the up-to-date data on usage of the rates from the CSO before making any recommendation in relation to sub-minima rates.  </p>  <p>  The QNHS results from the pilot question for 2016 are now available, and I understand that the Low Pay Commission intends to submit its recommendations to me in a supplementary report before the end of the year.  The question of whether a change in the current system might be warranted or desirable will be considered further in light of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. </p></reply>

The Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.</p><p>The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice.  The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agicultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the current closed periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.  A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters during the winter and the current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are highest.  Farmers are advised to spread slurry early in the season when growth and nutrient uptake are at their peak.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been closely monitoring the situation and have recognised that there may be some potential concerns for animal welfare arising from heavy rainfall in specific parts of the country (the north west in particular).  Farmers with such concerns were advised to contact the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at (053) 9163444 or by email to  with details of the flooding and/or trafficability situation, their herd number and other relevant data. Saturday 14 October was the latest date for such contact to be made. </p><p>Farmers wishing to avail of such flexibility are being being advised: </p><p>1. To spread only that volume of slurry necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity for the remainder of the closed period</p><p>2. That any spreading should occur as soon as good spreading conditions exist</p><p>3. That they will be prioritised for inspection by Local Authorities in the immediate future to ensure compliance with the Nitrates Regulations</p><p>4. That assessment of overall on-farm storage capacity may be part of that inspection process</p><p>5. That the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will subsequently contact the farmers to ascertain and record the date(s) on which this additional spreading takes place.</p><p>Local Authority inspection reports will be returned to my Department and will be shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and those farms needing to avail of this flexibility will become a priority category for inspections in future years also.</p></reply>
