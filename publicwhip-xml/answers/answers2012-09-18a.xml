    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800051#WRA00700"><p>Under the Derelict Sites Act 1990, local authorities are required to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site. To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.</p><p>  The National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments identified the Derelict Sites Act as a potential legal instrument that could be used by local authorities as part of a range of measures to deal with the problems generated by, for example, unfinished housing developments.  While I have no plans to amend the Derelict Sites Act at this time, I will keep the need for further legislative reforms to assist local authorities in addressing the issues of dereliction, including unfinished or unoccupied estates, under review.  I would also point out that local authorities also have powers under other legislation to deal with derelict sites or structures, for example, under the Sanitary Services Act 1963.</p></reply>

At these meetings, I generally meet with the officers of the associations and discuss topics of interest including local government reform, the efficiency agenda and funding issues.  Regular visits to individual local authorities also afford me the opportunity to discuss such matters with both Councillors and County/City Managers.</p><p><br />  My Department&#8217;s Senior Management Team meets a number of times each year with the executive of the County and City Managers&#8217; Association (CCMA) to discuss a wide range of matters of concern including efficiencies, funding and local government reform.  I have also met personally with the managers as a group on a number of occasions.  Earlier this year I met with the chairs of the CCMA sub-committees to discuss a range of topics and also with a delegation from the CCMA in January 2012 to discuss progress made by the sector in implementing recommendations contained in the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group.  The CCMA has worked closely with the Local Government Efficiency Review Implementation Group to progress recommendations of the Report within the competence of local government, including in areas such as shared services, local government sector procurement and an integrated ICT strategy.  Furthermore, the aforementioned associations have made submissions to my Department covering a range of issues including local government reform, the alignment of local government and community development, property tax, efficiencies etc.</p><p><br />  Implementation of the reform agenda in terms of local government is being driven by my Department in partnership with the County and City Managers&#8217; Association (CCMA). A joint Public Service Reform Oversight Group has been established which includes the Secretary General of my Department and CCMA representatives. A dedicated Project Management Office reports to the oversight group. The PMO has been staffed and resourced drawing from existing expertise and resources in the sector. Experienced staff from a number of authorities, with a range of appropriate skills, have been seconded to the PMO.</p><p><br />  The CCMA has identified total savings of &#8364;830m in respect of the period 2008 to 2012. This includes payroll and expenditure savings.  Local authorities have shed some 8,200 staff since June 2008 whilst continuing to maintain an impressive level of public service delivery.  Savings achieved to date through new work practices and efficiency measures will help to maintain the maximum level of services provided by the various local authorities.</p><p>The Government&#8217;s broad policy approach to local government reform was set out in the <i>Programme for Government</i>. In line with this, I intend to publish a detailed policy statement and action programme for the reform of local government very shortly. The programme will set out a clear vision for the future of local government and proposals to achieve it, with particular focus on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels, expanding the role of local government, maximising operational and organisational efficiency and improving governance, oversight, local political and executive leadership and citizen engagement.</p><p><br />  The reform programme will also reflect other work under way in relation to various aspects of local government, including local authority mergers, efficiency implementation, local government funding and alignment of local and community development with local government.</p></reply>

Since the announcement in December 2011 that NAMA would commit to providing units for social housing by the end of 2012, a Steering Group comprising my Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA have been working together with housing authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs) towards achieving this objective.  Progress to date in delivering units for social housing purposes has been slow.  In the main this is due to the complexities of getting agreement from multiple parties operating within an environment subject to a range of legal and financial constraints.  I hope that the recent establishment by NAMA of a Special Purpose Vehicle, to facilitate the leasing of units, will ensure speedier delivery  on the commitment.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered, NAMA have identified over 3,700 units to be considered for social housing.  Of those that have been examined to date, 438 have been deemed unsuitable by housing authorities.  A further 542 have been withdrawn, usually by property owners as circumstances change e.g. units have been sold or let privately and are no longer available.  Another 1,246 units are for examination by housing authorities as to their suitability for social housing purposes.</p><p>  At present demand has been confirmed for over 1,500 units which are currently being processed.  Of the 1,500 units, 391 are currently under negotiation with relevant parties (i.e. AHB&rsquo;s, housing authorities, NAMA, receivers, property owners etc.).  A further 167 are under active consideration for acquisition by the Special Purpose Vehicle. </p><p>  To the end of August 2012, 118 housing units have been provided from the portfolio of units identified by NAMA.  94 of these units are for social housing purposes.  Of these units 34 are funded under leasing arrangements with the balance of units delivered funded through the local authority social housing capital investment programme or by AHB&rsquo;s under the Capital Assistance Scheme.</p></reply>

The statutory objective was met in 81% of cases in 2011 compared to 64% in 2010 and 26% in 2009.  This objective also applies to strategic infrastructure applications. Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of delays arising from the holding of an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make the decision.</p><p>  It is the case, of course, that strategic infrastructure applications, by their very nature tend to be large-scale, complex cases which place greater demands on the capacity and expertise of the Board. Nevertheless, it is the duty of the Board, having regard to the special importance of applications relating to strategic infrastructure development, to ensure that consultations are held and decisions are taken as expeditiously as is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development, and for that purpose to take all practicable steps to avoid delays in the decision making process. It is also a requirement for applicants, prior to the submission of applications for strategic infrastructure development, to engage in consultation with bodies prescribed under article 213 of the Planning and Development Regulations. </p><p>  Accordingly, while it is important that the Board should seek to maximise the extent to which it can meet its statutory objective, I do not consider it appropriate to introduce binding time limits for decisions by the Board.</p></reply>

To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are forced to operate, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes beginning in the current year.</p></reply>

My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that mortgage lending is prudentially based and that the capacity of a borrower to fully service a loan over the full term is realistically assessed and stress-tested. </p><p>  The current credit policy has been in effect since 2009 to ensure consistency and best practice across the sector by providing a clear evidence-based rationale for decisions on loan applications. All applicants are now assessed according to the same criteria and independent scrutiny. Their ability to pay at the time of application, and according to prevailing interest rates, is assessed and a variety of stress scenarios are also applied.  It is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased since the credit policy was introduced. However, it is also clear that the loans issued under that credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. I am happy that the current policies are fair and adequately meet the needs of prospective borrowers.</p></reply>

Their assessment involved a detailed examination of the application materials, issues raised in submissions received from the public and prescribed bodies, and the applicant&rsquo;s responses to those issues.

It is a comprehensive report containing twenty four inter related recommendations covering a wide range of issues.  The report provides a framework to move forward and make progress towards providing solutions for homeowners.  </p><p>  Implementation of many of the recommendations requires the involvement and co-operation of a number of stakeholders and other bodies and may also require detailed policy and legislative considerations.  The Pyrite Panel included a detailed Implementation Plan in its report identifying the bodies with primary responsibility for implementation of the various recommendations.  While it is not possible to put a definite timeframe on implementation at this early stage, I will be working with those bodies identified in the Implementation Plan to achieve progress as quickly as possible.  I am conscious of the plight of homeowners who are coping with very difficult situations and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and I will pursue the implementation of the report with the urgency it deserves.</p><p>  Work has already commenced on a number of fronts.  I have engaged in a consultation process with responsible stakeholders and have set a deadline of the end of September for them to come back to me with credible solutions.  Work is also progressing on the development of a testing protocol and a method statement for remediation work. Recommendations in relation to the development of a mandatory certification system for buildings and a registration process for builders are currently being dealt with by my Department.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p><p>  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) administers the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. I understand from data provided by the LGMA that, as of 14 September 2012, 1,045,499 households had registered for payment of the charge, equating to revenue of some &euro;103m.  I am informed by the LGMA that between 2 and 13 July, reminder letters in respect of 103,905 non-registered addresses were issued by local authorities nationwide, with a second tranche issuing between 7 and 20 August in respect of 65,212 households.  Local authorities are currently in the process of issuing a third and final tranche of reminder letters to 52,246 households nationwide.  In total, some 221,363 letters have been issued to date to households that have not paid the charge.</p><p>  The communication and advertising campaign for the household charge is a matter for the LGMA and the county and city councils.  Following the 31 March payment deadline, national and local radio advertisements were undertaken to remind people of their obligations under the household charge legislation.  In particular, this campaign was aimed at reminding householders that late payment penalties applied after 31 March and that unpaid household charges and late payment penalties remain as a charge against the property concerned and will have to be discharged in the event of the transfer or sale of the property.  In addition, local authorities also took local initiatives to remind people of their obligations under the legislation. Further local and national communications and advertising will be undertaken by the LGMA and local authorities as considered appropriate.</p></reply>

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters including the most appropriate method of valuation. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. </p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system. A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system. Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.</p><p>  A property-based tax such as rates has a distinct advantage over any tax based on profits or incomes as it is generally found to be easy to collect and difficult to evade. A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p><p>  In relation to the suggestion of a disincentive to the occupation of vacant premises, I can confirm that under rating legislation, the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner, rather than the occupier, may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate.  Should a person&rsquo;s occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate, then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year. However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies. However, an owner of a vacant premises is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes. These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.</p><p>  Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can support the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities. I am committed to continuing to impress on local authorities the need to maintain and enhance efficiency measures with a view to minimising rates and other charges to business.</p></reply>

The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.  It was considered that, in light of the complex issues involved, a property tax would take time to introduce and accordingly to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government decided to introduce a household charge in 2012 as an interim measure.</p><p>  By international standards, the revenue base of local authorities in Ireland is relatively narrow, and local authorities here are disproportionately dependent on central Government funding.  The introduction in 2009 of the charge on non-principal private residences represented an important step change in how local government is financed and was the first dedicated new source of funding for local authorities in some years.  It did not, however, go far enough in addressing the imbalance in the sector&rsquo;s financing.  A more effective broadening of the revenue base for local government will be achieved by the household charge and the forthcoming full local property tax.</p><p>  In February 2012 an independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation-based full local property tax.  The Group recently submitted its report to me and its recommendations will be considered in due course.  Proposals will be brought to Government as soon as possible and it will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the exact details of implementation taking into account the modalities involved. The Government has decided that the local property tax will be collected and administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Accordingly, delivery of social housing will be primarily facilitated by more flexible funding models, with the social housing leasing initiative, in its various forms, playing a central role.The Programme for Government   listed some of the options, which my Department is exploring on a continuing basis, to facilitate the increased provision of social housing, including through the mechanism of social housing bonds and the viability of utilising the value of existing social housing stock as a means of leveraging further funding for the provision of social housing.  The Housing Policy Statement, published in July 2011, elaborated on this, setting out a range of mechanisms through which the Government is committed to developing the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease, and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. </p><p>  Under the latter option, approved housing bodies will be able to build or acquire new social housing, remunerating their borrowings with funding provided by the Department under the leasing scheme. At the end of the loan period the approved housing body will own outright the units which will either continue to be made available for social housing purposes or may be sold to sitting tenants.  A number of projects of this nature, involving loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency being used by an approved housing body to purchase new stock, have been approved. I expect this facility to be a critical source of new social housing provision in the years ahead. A range of other funding options remain under examination with a view to maximising the delivery of housing supports.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates. </p><p>  I and my Government colleagues have been concerned for some time with the slow pace of the revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill to amend the Valuation Act 2001.  In addition to accelerating the revaluation of all rateable property in the country, the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill proposes to amend existing valuation legislation in a number of areas by facilitating the adoption of new approaches to valuation, including self-assessment and external service delivery options, through the outsourcing of elements of the valuation function, where appropriate. The amendments are formulated with the intention of making the valuation code more transparent, to correct deficiencies in the Valuation Act 2001 and to streamline aspects of the Act, especially with regard to the appeal procedures.</p><p>  While the enactment of some sections of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill will increase costs for some State bodies, the expansion of the rates base should allow for reductions in the overall rates burden on businesses while maintaining the rates income of local authorities.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received twelve applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded status to four bodies. The Agency has approved four applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &euro;13.4 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2012, under this Scheme, with more approved housing bodies applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.</p><p>  I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA in the current year.</p></reply>

One of the biggest difficulties faced both here and internationally is the definition and categorisation of households who for one reason or another find themselves without a home for long or short periods of time.  The CSO figure, published on 6 September 2012, of 3,808 persons either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless is of course indicative of a persisting serious issue for our society. However, it is important to note that the rough sleeper count is 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin.  It is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but it is important that the homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough.  The vast majority of people classified in the CSO's report as homeless are in long-term or emergency accommodation.</p><p><br />  One of my priorities is to ensure that people have access to secure, stable, appropriate accommodation.  Short-term interventions are not a long-term solution to homelessness.  I am determined that real solutions for people who find themselves without a home are provided.  The <i>Programme for Government</i> committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, <i>The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013</i> and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is almost complete.  The review will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  On its conclusion, I will be indicating what I expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness. </p></reply>

The making and amendment of such an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of each housing authority. The Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011, which came into effect on 1 May 2011, set out the conditions that housing authorities must take into account when making their allocation schemes.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank&rsquo;s first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank&rsquo;s revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance to local authorities earlier this year in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.</p><p>  Repossession remains extremely rare for local authority borrowers, with only 128 repossessions across all local authority areas carried out between 2005 and 2010. Clearly, where repossession does occur it is only as a last resort, and my Department is aware that it generally involves those households in arrears who refuse to engage with the local authority lender.  It is generally the case that a local authority will look to sell a repossessed property on the open market as quickly as possible in order to minimise their own exposure to financial loss in respect of the loan finance provided through them to the borrower.</p></reply>

This reflects the need to: &ndash;  put the funding of locally-delivered services on a sound financial footing; improve accountability; and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.</p><p>I established an Inter-Departmental expert group tasked with designing a property tax and the Group, chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill, considered the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation-based property tax. The Group has completed its work and submitted a report to me on 14 June 2012 which will be considered by Government in due course. It is expected that decisions on the new property tax will be taken in the context of Budget 2013. A Government decision has been taken to give the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for preparing the relevant legislation and the administration and collection of the &quot;Local Property Tax&quot;.  Appropriate preparatory work is being undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>General-Purpose Grants are just one of the sources of revenue for local authorities.  Income from local sources such as commercial rates, housing rents, environmental and other waste charges, and charges for non-domestic water services provide over half of the current funding needs of local authorities.

International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption and this is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.

The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State. It should be noted that the specific information regarding job losses requested by the Deputy is not available as the QNHS is a measure of the level of employment only. Changes in the level of employment are a function of both jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question. The most recent figures available for employment levels are for the first quarter of 2012.</p><p>Estimates of the level of employment by sector up to and including the first quarter of 2012 are presented in Table  1 below. Given the seasonal nature of changes in employment across the year the estimates presented have been seasonally adjusted. Between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 the level of employment fell by 7,300 on a seasonally adjusted basis. There was some level of fluctuation in numbers employed across all sectors of the economy with increases being recorded in some cases and decreases being recorded in others. As the QNHS is a sample survey the CSO urges some caution in interpreting changes of relatively low orders of magnitude.</p><p>Table 1   Seasonally Adjusted Series of persons aged 15 years and over in employment (ILO) classified by NACE Rev. 2 Economic Sector,</p><p><b>Quarter 1 2011 - Quarter 1 2012</b></p><p>Economic sector</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>(NACE Rev. 2)</th><th><div>Q1 2011</div></th><th><div>Q2 2011</div></th><th><div>Q3 2011</div></th><th><div>Q4 2011</div></th><th><div>Q1 2012</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>All persons</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Agriculture, forestry and fishing</td><td><div>83.9</div></td><td><div>85.6</div></td><td><div>81.1</div></td><td><div>81.3</div></td><td><div>81.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>B-E</td><td>Industry</td><td><div>234.9</div></td><td><div>232.8</div></td><td><div>232.2</div></td><td><div>237.5</div></td><td><div>234.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>Construction</td><td><div>108.0</div></td><td><div>106.3</div></td><td><div>107.5</div></td><td><div>106.8</div></td><td><div>103.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles</td><td><div>262.8</div></td><td><div>264.5</div></td><td><div>265.4</div></td><td><div>263.8</div></td><td><div>264.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>Transportation and storage </td><td><div>94.6</div></td><td><div>94.7</div></td><td><div>94.4</div></td><td><div>91.1</div></td><td><div>89.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>Accommodation and food service activities</td><td><div>102.7</div></td><td><div>108.3</div></td><td><div>111.1</div></td><td><div>115.7</div></td><td><div>111.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>J</td><td>Information and communication</td><td><div>70.5</div></td><td><div>73.5</div></td><td><div>74.0</div></td><td><div>76.2</div></td><td><div>75.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>K-L</td><td>Financial, insurance and real estate activities</td><td><div>101.1</div></td><td><div>102.9</div></td><td><div>97.9</div></td><td><div>102.2</div></td><td><div>100.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>Professional, scientific and technical activities</td><td><div>101.9</div></td><td><div>100.7</div></td><td><div>96.8</div></td><td><div>94.7</div></td><td><div>94.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>Administrative and support service activities</td><td><div>63.0</div></td><td><div>65.3</div></td><td><div>64.6</div></td><td><div>63.8</div></td><td><div>61.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>O</td><td>Public administration and defence; compulsory social security</td><td><div>107.1</div></td><td><div>99.9</div></td><td><div>101.1</div></td><td><div>102.3</div></td><td><div>100.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>P</td><td>Education</td><td><div>147.4</div></td><td><div>144.5</div></td><td><div>142.6</div></td><td><div>141.1</div></td><td><div>144.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>Human health and social work activities</td><td><div>232.9</div></td><td><div>237.9</div></td><td><div>236.1</div></td><td><div>237.2</div></td><td><div>236.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>R-U</td><td>Other NACE activities</td><td><div>103.9</div></td><td><div>98.4</div></td><td><div>95.1</div></td><td><div>95.3</div></td><td><div>97.2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Total Employment</b></td><td><div><b>1,818.1</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,816.1</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,796.5</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,807.6</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,800.3</b></div></td></tr></table></p><p>Reference period: q1=Jan-Mar, q2=Apr-Jun, q3=Jul-Sep, q4=Oct-Dec;</p><p>Source: Quarterly National Household Survey, Central Statistics Office.</p></reply>

This was derived as the difference between the total usually resident population as measured at both censuses less the natural increase in the population (that is the births less the deaths) for the intervening period.  The preliminary estimate of net migration over the 2006 to 2011 period, published as part of the annual population estimates series, was 29,000, giving a difference of 87,000 compared with the census figure.</p><p>  To put the difference in context it is important to bear in mind that the estimated gross migration flows over this inter-censal period account for about one-sixth of the total 2011 population.  The principal source of information for the inter-censal estimates of both immigration and emigration is the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  The published estimates, which are classified by sex, broad age group, origin and destination, and nationality are subject to sampling variability.  A revised series of inter-censal population estimates will be published on 27th September. This will incorporate data from a number of sources, such as: a more detailed analysis of the number of Personal Public Service (PPS) numbers allocated to non-Irish nationals in a given year who still had either employment (P35) or social welfare activity the following year; census results on one year inflows by age and sex, and the recorded years of arrival of immigrants.</p><p>  Revisions to emigration data will incorporate details of work permits issued to Irish nationals in respect of a number of destinations including Australia, US, Canada and New Zealand.   In addition, the number of National Insurance numbers (equivalent to PPS numbers) issued to Irish nationals in the UK will be incorporated in the revisions.</p><p>  This new analysis will form part of ongoing work aimed at improving the methodology used to measure migration.  The next issue of the Population and Migration Estimates to be published on 27th September 2012 will provide estimates of the population for April 2012 along with estimated immigration and emigration in the year to April 2012, and also revised estimates for immigration, emigration and total population for the years 2007-2011.</p></reply>

It was established under the NESDO Act 2006 and is the body corporate for the National Economic and Social Council (NESC).   NESDO has already completed a substantial restructuring programme.  On 1 April 2010, two of its constituent bodies, the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP) were dissolved.  This led to substantial savings on both pay and non-pay expenditure, mainly as a result of reduced accommodation, rent, staffing levels and administrative costs.  The 2012 Estimate for NESDO is &#8364;2,220,000.  This is a reduction of over &#8364;1.1m<b></b>  on 2010.</p><p><br />  My Department also rationalised the work and achieved substantial savings in relation to three other bodies which were formerly within its remit in recent years.  The total separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Active Citizenship Office ceased in 2009.  The separate Offices in these areas have been discontinued which has given rise to savings in my Department&#8217;s Estimates of approximately &#8364;356,000 per annum.  The National Forum on Europe was closed in 2009 which also gave rise to savings in the Estimates of &#8364;360,000.</p><p><br />  The only working groups set up by my Department since February 2011 are: the China Follow-Up Group, which was established following my visit to China in March 2012; and the Communications Working Group, established earlier this year to ensure a coordinated approach to promoting Ireland&#8217;s international reputation.  Both of these interdepartmental groups comprise officials from across Government Departments and agencies.   Meetings are chaired by officials from my Department.</p></reply>

Provision for recoupment of any expenses incurred is in line with existing civil service guidelines.</p><p>The NESC is an advisory Council which provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development.  Appointments to the NESC are made in accordance with the provisions of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 as amended by the National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.   I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  It would not be appropriate to advertise these positions as they are nominated in a representative capacity.</p><p>I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  Historically, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson posts are filled from my Department at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary level.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure the Council's work is integrated with Government policy-making and would not be suitable for public advertisement.</p><p>Finally, I appointed a number of independents in June and July last year. The independent nominations to NESC were not advertised last year, as I was satisfied with the skill sets and expertise of the nominees which had already been identified, mainly from the academic sector.  However it may be appropriate to advertise the positions in the future. I am satisfied that these appointments were appropriate, bearing in mind the key strategic role of the NESC.</p><p>In relation to the NESDO, Section 13 of the 2006 Act provides that the Office comprises the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the constituent bodies, now only the NESC.</p><p>There has been one appointment to the National Statistics Board (NSB) since I took office.  Mr. John Callinan, an Assistant Secretary at my Department, was appointed to the NSB in line with the provisions of Section 18 (1)(b) of the Statistics Act 1993.  He receives no additional remuneration for his role on the Board and has not received any expenses since his appointment.  My functions in relation to the NSB, were delegated to the Government Chief Whip, Minister of State Paul Kehoe T.D., on the 22 March 2011.  As such, the appointment to the NSB was made by Minister of State Kehoe.</p></reply>

Obviously, opportunities for employment in the Public Service is limited by the recruitment and promotion moratorium which was announced on the 27th March 2009.  The moratorium applies, with limited exceptions, to the civil service, local authorities, non-commercial state bodies, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Permanent Defence   Forces and to certain bodies established by enactment and wholly or partly funded out of the Central Fund.  Arrangements have been modulated also regarding the education and health sectors.  </p><p>  The 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service remains in place, notwithstanding the moratorium.  My Department, as published in the National Disability Authority's latest  report on compliance of 2011, exceeded the 3% requirement (4.2%).</p><p>  My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all staff.  Staff are recruited on the basis that they meet the requirement of the positions they are to fill.  In addition to complying with the provisions of the Disability Act, 2005, we follow the guidelines set out in the Commission for Public Service Appointment's Code of Practice for the Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Civil Service.  </p><p>  Recruitment to my Department is made in line with the Public Appointments Commission's Code of Practice  and through positive action programmes such as the Willing, Able and Mentoring Programme under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Promotion, training and all other benefits, supports and opportunities are decided on the grounds of ability, qualifications and other relevant objective criteria.  There are currently 205 people employed in my Department.  Given the relatively small size of my Department, it would be inappropriate to disclose the number of people with a disability who have been employed since 1 January 2011 to date as this could possibly make these individuals identifiable.</p></reply>

Throughout this dreadful period both the McAreavey and Harte families have borne their terrible grief with great dignity.   Throughout their ordeal the family received every consular assistance required, both from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and from our Embassy in South Africa which is also accredited to Mauritius.  </p><p>  I know the verdict in the case further deepened the dismay of the family that no one had been made accountable for the murder of Michaela and that justice has not been served in this case.  The subsequent publication of photographs of Michaela in a Mauritian newspaper caused real and justified outrage throughout Ireland.  Our Ambassador to South Africa and Mauritius, Brendan McMahon travelled to Mauritius to convey to the Government of Mauritius the deep sense of shock and outrage in Ireland at what had happened in this case.</p><p>  The Ambassador subsequently met with Prime Minister, Ramgoolam and with Foreign Minister Boolell. The Ambassador received the assurance that the Mauritian authorities are fully conscious of their responsibilities in the case. A dreadful murder has taken place and it is the responsibility of the Government of Mauritius to do all it can to arrest those guilty of the murder, to place them on trial and to secure a conviction. With this in mind, the case is now being reinvestigated by a specially appointed new team of detectives. This is being done in the context of the Mauritian Government&rsquo;s request to their Director of Public Prosecutions to consider establishing a special judicial review to look into this case. </p><p>  In sum therefore, they have provided us with the assurance that the case is not closed and that they are taking a fresh look at every aspect of the case.  I will of course ensure that our Embassy in South Africa continues to liaise with the relevant authorities in Mauritius and closely monitors the progress of this new investigation. I and my officials will of course keep the family briefed on any and all developments.</p></reply>

A core high level goal of the current strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to 2014 is to promote Ireland&#8217;s economic interests in Europe and internationally. My Department works closely with all the other relevant Departments and State Agencies with an interest in promoting Ireland overseas to achieve this goal.</p><p><br />  The Programme for Government set protecting and creating jobs as a key objective and, to that end, the Government established a dedicated Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to take this work forward.  It is, of course, a task shared across Government, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As envisaged in the Action Plan for Jobs and the Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Investment, I have made clear that it is a priority task for every part of our Embassy network to work closely with the State Agencies in identifying new opportunities and supporting trade and investment promotion in their countries of accreditation, as well as in establishing coordinated market plans of activity under the Government&#8217;s trade strategy.  </p><p><br />  Local Market Teams chaired by the relevant Ambassador and comprising representatives of the locally based State Agencies have been established in all of the priority markets identified under the Trade Strategy. These teams execute detailed market plans which aim to optimise the overall resources of Embassies and Agencies to deliver ambitious targets.  Progress on implementing our Trade Strategy by these Local Market Teams is monitored by the Export Trade Council, which I established and which I chair and which will have its third meeting on 20 September.  </p><p><br />  Since becoming T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have also been active in promoting opportunities for Irish companies overseas, both through targeted trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland and in the course of broader working visits abroad.  The Action Plan for Jobs set a target of 12 trade missions each year.  I am pleased to say that, in addition to the Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day ministerial programme which in many cases included trade focussed events, so far this year 10 Enterprise Ireland-led trade missions have taken place, supported in each case by our Embassy network, and a further 8 are scheduled to take place between now and the end of the year.  </p><p><br />  As outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government has repeatedly stated its belief that our Diaspora can make a meaningful contribution to Ireland&#8217;s economic recovery. The Global Irish Network, which is managed by my Department, is a central element of the Government&#8217;s engagement with the Diaspora in support of our economic goals.  Following the Global Irish Economic Forum in October 2011, Network members and the wider Diaspora have been working with my Department, our Embassy network and our State Agencies on a number of initiatives in support of our job creation goals, including: the development by Enterprise Ireland and my Department of the Global Irish Contacts Programme, several events aimed at highlighting Ireland as a premier FDI location &#8211; for example, the Invest in Ireland Roundtable in New York with President Clinton<b></b>  in February 2012 and the &#8220;Invest in Ireland Forum&#8221; with Coca Cola to coincide with the Notre Dame v Navy football game in late August - as well as significant support for The Gathering, and the Succeed in Ireland initiative.  </p><p><br />  The Government has also formalised the involvement of Global Irish Network members in trade missions and the Export Trade Council has requested Embassies and Local Market Teams to consider, where appropriate, the involvement of GIN members when planning and organising activities in their respective regions.  In addition to the formal projects undertaken by the Global Irish Networks, our overseas communities, business organisations and Chambers of Commerce continue to work with our Embassy network and State Agencies to promote Ireland and to assist Irish companies seeking to break into new markets.</p></reply>

Given the particular nature of the Department&rsquo;s work, officers at Headquarters and Missions abroad are frequently required to travel and work outside of normal office hours in order to perform their duties effectively. This will often involve early morning and late night travel at times when public transport is not available or feasible.  In addition, some officials posted abroad operate in environments where other forms of public transport are unsuitable, unavailable or unsafe.</p><p>My Department makes every effort to minimise expenditure, including by strict enforcement of usage policy and the use of competitive procurement for ongoing headquarters requirements. Taxi costs in my Department have shown a consistent pattern of reduction from &euro;453,000 in 2008 to &euro;233,000 in 2011, a reduction of 48%.</p></reply>

In the time provided, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of every occasion.   In 2011, my Department spent &euro;501,120 on State and official entertainment. This covers the costs associated with State and Official Visits to Ireland by Heads of State or Government or other high-level visiting dignitaries, costs associated with Official or State Visits abroad by the President, certain costs associated with Official Visits abroad by the Taoiseach and miscellaneous expenditure associated with visits and events such as printing of invitations and the purchase of flags.</p><p>  There is also budget provision for official entertaining carried out by Divisions of my Department in pursuit of their business objectives including entertainment costs incurred in relation to the Irish Aid programme. Spending in 2011 amounted to &euro;103,880.</p><p>  Officers serving at Diplomatic Missions abroad are required to carry out certain representational duties in line with the Department&rsquo;s strategies and the Mission&rsquo;s business plan.  Official representation is an important avenue towards achievement of Mission and Departmental objectives, including the promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s political, economic and cultural interests in the European Union and in the wider world.  The quality and outreach nature of representational activity also present a positive image of Ireland on the international stage.</p><p>  Representation expenditure is incurred within clearly defined Departmental guidelines and also guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Over the past four years expenditure on representation has been brought back to 2003/2004 levels, including a cut to Mission representation budgets of nearly 30% in 2010. Spending on representational duties in 2011 amounted to &euro;1.98m.</p></reply>

From time to time, consultants or companies with a public relations and communications background are commissioned to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.</p><p>In the period in question, my Department has commissioned a small number of consultancies to provide specialist ICT and accounting support.</p><p>In addition, my Department, through Irish Aid (Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme), occasionally commissions outside expertise where the effective management, evaluation and review of the programme necessitates the use of such skills. Elements of the aid programme are highly technical such as the areas of HIV/AIDS, communicable diseases, nutrition, agriculture and others. It is essential if the aid programme is to remain at the cutting edge of development science that it utilises outside expertise from time to time for quality assurance and to provide access to the latest knowledge. Utilising external expertise on a temporary basis can also provide excellent value for money as the skills involved are only utilised on a needs rather than full-time basis.</p><p>Consultants are engaged only where specialised knowledge and skills are not available within the Department and where independent appraisal, audit, monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects are required.Decisions on the need to commission outside expertise are subject to the establishment of appropriate business cases and an approvals process carried out by the Irish Aid Senior Management Group. National and international regulations are fully complied with in subsequent tendering processes.The level of expenditure on consultancy services is constantly monitored to ensure that it does not exceed the level required for the proper management, oversight, monitoring, evaluation and audit of the aid programme.</p><p>A table detailing expenditure on consultancy services under both Votes since February 2011 is provided here:</p><p><b>Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs)</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Consultants February 2011 &#8211;

The Passport Service has been in discussion with the mother of this child regarding issues associated with the consent of the father.  These discussions have focussed on evidence as to whether the named father on the child&rsquo;s birth certificate is a guardian under Irish law.  If the father is, in fact, a legal guardian then the Act requires that his consent be obtained.  If his consent is not forthcoming, the mother has the option to seek a court order disposing of his consent for the issue of a passport.</p><p>  It should be noted that in the interests of the applicant the Passport Service issued a temporary passport of seven months validity to allow the child to travel for a pressing pre-arranged trip overseas.  This will ensure that the child can travel while his mother resolves the outstanding guardianship question, which needs to be clarified under Irish law, before his application can be finalised.</p></reply>

The Department carefully monitors its staffing complement to ensure that it exceeds the Government target of 3% of staff with a disability, which is applicable across the Public Service.  The position is reviewed annually on the basis of self-declaration, in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines.

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis.  Ireland&rsquo;s missions abroad perform a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.</p><p>The annual costs as set out in the following table for 2010 and 2011 are the administrative costs of operating the overseas Missions under the two Votes of my Department &ndash; Vote 27 (International Cooperation) and Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs).  The figures do not include the salaries of the Irish based staff as these are a charge on the overall salaries budget of the Department rather than on a specific Mission.  The budgets of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid (Vote 27) reflect the additional management and oversight required for the effective implementation of those important programmes.</p><p>Mission Expenditure 2010 &amp; 2011</p><p><table><tr><th>Mission</th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th></tr><tr><td>ABU DHABI</td><td><div>545,048 </div></td><td><div>385,694 </div></td></tr><tr><td>ABUJA</td><td><div>278,241 </div></td><td><div>252,983 </div></td></tr><tr><td>ADDIS ABABA</td><td><div>           1,377,121 </div></td><td><div>        1,210,495 </div></td></tr><tr><td>ANKARA</td><td><div>394,114 </div></td><td><div>379,651 </div></td></tr><tr><td>ATHENS</td><td><div>489,042 </div></td><td><div>471,858 </div></td></tr><tr><td>ATLANTA -

Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, the candidate of the PRI - the Institutional Revolutionary Party - has been confirmed by the Mexican electoral authorities as the winner of the election and will take office on 1 December.  Mexico&rsquo;s legislative framework for elections is highly detailed and provides for independent and non-partisan electoral bodies and dispute mechanisms. Reforms in this area in recent years have strengthened further the framework and the transparency of the electoral process.  Some 30,000 Mexican and 500 foreign observers were registered as observers for Election Day, including the officers of the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico City.  The European Union and the Organisation of American States, amongst others, conducted specialist oversight of the election.</p><p>  Availing of the legislative provisions open to him, the candidate who came second requested the Mexican Federal Electoral Institute to conduct a recount, claiming widespread voting irregularities.  He lodged also a detailed law-suit with the Federal Electoral Tribunal alleging vote buying, media bias and other abuses in favour of the PRI candidate.  The Federal Electoral Institute recounted close to 55% of the presidential ballot.  It confirmed the result in favour of Mr Pe&ntilde;a Nieto by a significant margin.  The Federal Electoral Tribunal endorsed this result, confirming that the election was carried out in line with legislation and rejecting the various claims made as grounds to nullify the election.  This outcome is consistent with the views of respected international observers.  I warmly congratulate Mr Pe&ntilde;a Nieto and wish him every success in fulfilling his mandate.

We appreciate the responsibility that rests on the parties to these negotiations and wish them success in their important work.

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, have also been very active in pursuit of progress in this difficult case.  I met with the wife, daughter and other family representatives of the person mentioned by the Deputy on 29 February 2012.  The person&rsquo;s wife and other family representatives also met with the Head of the Consular Division on 28 May 2012.  As a result of these meetings I once again wrote to the Sri Lankan Minister of External Affairs on 18 June 2012, urging on behalf of the Government of Ireland, that the person mentioned by the Deputy, either be released or charged at the earliest opportunity.  I also informed the Minister of External Affairs that I would like to personally meet with him in the margins of any international meeting at which we are both present, to discuss the case, should the opportunity arise.  A response to my letter is awaited.</p><p>  I am informed that at a fundamental rights hearing of the case before the local Sri Lankan Courts on 10 September 2012, the case was postponed to 8 November 2012, much to the distress of his family, as these hearings have been repeatedly postponed.  I am most conscious and concerned about the fact that the person mentioned by the Deputy has now spent 5 years in detention without charge.  I can assure the Deputy that all possible consideration will be given to any requests that the family may raise and that I and my officials will continue to seek to raise this case at every opportunity.</p></reply>

The Department also provides a comprehensive pre-posting training programme for officers in advance of taking up duty at Missions abroad.  This includes modules on economic issues, trade promotion, public diplomacy and consular services.  A contribution may also be made by the Department towards the cost of tuition fees incurred by staff members studying in their own time for certain qualifications relevant to the Department&rsquo;s activities and objectives. </p><p>  The achievement of value for money is a priority for the Department&rsquo;s Training and Development Unit.  Working within substantially reduced budgetary allocations since 2008, the Unit maximises the use of internal resources and limits to the greatest possible extent expenditure on professional external trainers.  Video conferencing technology is also now widely used to include posted and locally employed staff at Missions in training courses.  Little or no costs arise in the case of many training courses provided.  This is also the case with regard to our Mentoring Programme which, launched on a pilot basis in 2010,  is now being reviewed with a view to a wider roll-out.  </p><p>  It would be inordinately time-consuming to compile the requested detailed information for 2011 and 2012 to date.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I can advise that the Department&rsquo;s total expenditure on training and development in 2011 was &euro;483,435, representing a 55% reduction on the outturn for 2007.  Expenditure totalling &euro;294,892 has been incurred to date in the current year, from an overall budget of &euro;547,500.  The higher 2012 budget reflects the need for additional training relating to Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming EU Presidency, such as in foreign languages and in meeting chairmanship skills and negotiating skills.</p></reply>

The goal of the Summit was to secure renewed international political commitment for sustainable development, with a focus on the promotion of a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.  The Minister for the Environment took the lead in coordinating Ireland&#8217;s approach to the Summit, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was also actively engaged in the national consultation process before the Summit and through Irish Aid remains closely involved in the follow up to Rio+20.  In line with our priorities in international development, and Ireland&#8217;s strong focus on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, we ensured that effective responses to hunger and poor nutrition in developing countries were prioritised at the Rio meeting.  The private sector was actively involved in the preparations of the Rio Summit and the Summit itself and its key role in achieving sustainable development is highlighted throughout the outcome document, &#8220;The Future We Want&#8221; which, inter alia, states that:<blockquote>&#8220;<i>We acknowledge that the implementation of sustainable development will depend on the active engagement of both the public and the private sectors. We recognize that the active participation of the private sector can contribute to the achievement of sustainable development, including through the important tool of public-private partnerships</i>  &#8221;</blockquote>  With regard to the follow up to the Rio Summit, Ireland is working closely with the European Commission, the European External Action Service, the Cypriot Presidency of the EU and other Member States and through the UN to ensure the outcomes of Rio such as the process to develop Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are addressed in the context of the upcoming 2013 UN General Assembly Event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in a coherent and integrated manner.  In this context the Irish Presidency of the EU will be centrally engaged in agreeing a common EU position for the 2013 UN General Assembly Event on the MDGs and in seeking to develop an EU position on the Post-2015 development framework, taking into account both MDGs and SDGs.</p></reply>

Section 88A provides an associated tax incentive for employers. Employers may claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first 3 years&rsquo; wages paid to qualifying employees.

That approval was received from the European Commission in November 2011. The new incentive is available in respect of investments made on or after 25 November 2011. EII (like BES) is a tax incentive that provides tax relief for investors who purchase new ordinary shares in small and medium companies carrying on a trade. The purpose of EII is to enable companies raise new capital to expand their activities.  The scheme allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum (unchanged from BES) in each tax year up to 2013.  The main differences between EII and BES are as follows: The maximum amount that may be raised by a company in any 12 months has increased from &euro;1.5m to &euro;2.5m; The lifetime amount that may be raised by a company has increased from &euro;2m to &euro;10m; The period for which shares are required to be held has been reduced from 5 years to 3 years; The maximum rate of tax relief for subscriptions for eligible shares has been reduced from 41% to 30%, in recognition of the reduced holding period; A further 11% of tax relief may be available at the end of the holding period provided the company concerned has increased its number of employees or its expenditure on research and development.</p><p>  Unlike BES, which was limited to companies carrying on a restricted number of trades, EII applies to companies carrying on all types of trades&mdash; with a small number of exclusions, including managing hotels/guest houses/nursing homes, financing activities and dealing in or developing land.</p></reply>

However in reality it is impossible to estimate the level of additional tax revenue that would be realised due to behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a result of such a measure which would be a significant factor.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated in terms of expected 2012 profits, of increasing the standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5% to 15% is tentatively estimated on a straight line arithmetic basis to be about &euro;675 million.  While this estimate is technically correct it does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence. In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%.  This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland.</p><p>  The very major importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position in the current climate must also be borne in mind.  Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth.  Further, it would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s consistently strong view that we will not change our corporation tax strategy.  Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p></reply>

Generally I understand that previous claims experience will have a major influence on such matters.  Therefore, if there has been a major increase in claims in a particular area, as has happened with household insurance in the last few years, then this will be reflected in an increase in premiums.</p><p>  Competition in the market place acts as a constraint in such circumstances, however insurance companies have always to be conscious of their prudential obligations and are required by the Central Bank of Ireland to meet their capital requirements on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the sustainability of their business.  In these circumstances when they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is inevitable that their capital position will suffer and put pressure on prices. In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers in the EU known as Solvency II which will come into force from the start of 2014 will place a greater emphasis on the need to price risk appropriately than the existing regime, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy.  This will benefit the consumer in many instances.  However in circumstances where there has been a significant increase in claims, it is likely to result in higher premiums.</p><p>  It is worth noting that  past initiatives, in particular the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety which has reduced accidents significantly still continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level.  Another contributing factor to a more competitive market has been the introduction of  greater transparency in the price of insurance products enabling cost comparisons be carried out e.g. the National Consumers Agency&rsquo;s  focus on providing information to consumers on financial service products including insurance on &ldquo;Its your Money&rdquo; website (www.itsyourmoney.ie).  Finally, it should be noted that the ability of the Government to influence the competitiveness of insurance costs is limited as neither I as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from increasing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question.</p></reply>

The hidden economy includes the suppression of sales, wages and income by registered businesses, fraudulent repayment claims, smuggling and trading in counterfeit and contraband goods, unregistered traders and individuals working and &lsquo;signing&rsquo;. It is a multifaceted issue that requires a co-ordinated and multifaceted response.  Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects.  Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&rsquo;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.  Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions.  Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as its audit and investigation programmes.</p><p>  The Revenue&rsquo;s approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims.  The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy.  This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies.  Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted.  Increasingly Revenue is finding that bodies and individuals are prepared to share insights and specific information with regard to shadow economy activity.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to: </p><p>- The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>- The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.</p><p>Other new provisions included a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s tobacco strategy, &ldquo;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&rdquo; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans.  The strategic level plans include taking steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of Revenue resources.  The strategy also include further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at national and international level, together with a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.</p><p>  During 2011 Revenue seized a total of 109m cigarettes in 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4m cigarettes. Revenue also seized 11,158kg of tobacco in 2011. In six particular operations, over 19m cigarettes, 1,344 kgs tobacco and 49 vehicles were seized.  Regulations were also introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details to the Revenue Commissioners, of payments made.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk. Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, Radio, Local newspapers, Internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue.  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records.  To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax.</p><p>  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out.  The main focus of real time activity is on businesses that have the potential to operate with cash. This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc.  These operations have also resulted in the registration of previously unregistered persons. 803 such registrations were recorded in the period from January to the end of April 2012.  The results from all the various projects are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, site visits etc. which are published in the Revenue Annual Report.</p></reply>

Effectively addressing these three areas will result in increased employment, investment and consumer spending and will be key in driving this country forward.  Looking more specifically at what the Government is doing to restore sustainability to the public finances, we have met all our fiscal targets to date and are on track to meet future targets under the Programme of External Financial Assistance. Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, the Government set out the required fiscal adjustment path over the medium term.  This will provide Irish citizens with greater certainty regarding the magnitude of future budgetary adjustment measures and, in so doing, will help to improve confidence among households.</p><p>  In terms of repairing the banking sector, the Irish banking system has been recapitalised to a very high level and has undergone significant restructuring to make it fit for purpose.  The Government has imposed lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Progress on these lending targets is monitored by the Credit Review Office (CRO) and by my Department.  Additionally, the CRO ensures that the pillar banks do not refuse credit to viable businesses, both by its existence and by offering the right to a review of refusals.</p><p>  Competitiveness is improving and this is feeding through to exports and higher inward Foreign Direct Investment.  Earlier this month, the CSO published revised outturn figures for 2011 which confirm that growth resumed in the Irish economy last year with GDP increasing by 1.4 per cent, which is stronger than previously thought.  Most forecasters also expect positive growth this year, with exports leading the way.</p><p>  The Government is acutely aware of the headwinds which the domestic economy faces.  We have, therefore, taken a number of steps to support domestic activity and job creation, including the introduction of the Jobs Initiative shortly after coming into office and the structuring of Budget 2012 in such a way as to be as growth-friendly as possible.  I would also note that the latest KBC/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index for August shows a third consecutive increase in the index, which is at its highest level for about five years.  Overall, we have seen that Government policies, both domestic and at EU level, are helping to improve confidence among consumers and investors.</p></reply>

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is extremely difficult to estimate the loss to the Exchequer which results from shadow economy activity and that claims about the extent of this activity and the associated tax loss must be treated with caution unless supported by credible analysis. Research commissioned by Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in 2010 estimated that 14% of cigarettes consumed in the State were illicit product, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;250 million in excise and VAT annually, assuming that in the absence of illicit cigarettes, smokers would smoke the same quantity of tax paid cigarettes.</p><p>  In responding to the illicit cigarette problem, Revenue has adopted a comprehensive strategy that includes a range of programmes including border and inland operations, co-operation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level together with ongoing investigation and prosecution of all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion.  In the eight months to end-August 2012, 66.8m cigarettes with a retail value of &euro;30.2m and 2,706 kg of tobacco with a retail value of &euro;1m have been seized by Revenue.  In addition, Revenue obtained thirty-eight convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of &euro;63,750 imposed together with eighteen custodial sentences, four of which were suspended, and two community service orders.  There were a further forty-eight convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products.  Fines of &euro;84,200 were imposed in these cases, in addition to seventeen custodial sentences, ten of which were suspended, together with one community service order.</p><p>  In 2011, Revenue seized a total of 109.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &euro;45.95m and 11,158 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &euro;4m.   They also obtained one hundred and one convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of &euro;136,300 imposed, and thirty-one custodial sentences of which twenty-one were suspended.  There were a further fifty-seven convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of &euro;115,850 imposed, and fourteen custodial sentences of which seven were suspended.</p><p>  In relation to penalties, I am informed that persons convicted of indictable excise offences, including evasion of excise duty and dealing in unstamped tobacco products, are liable to a fine of up to &euro;126,970. This amount was increased from &euro;12,695 in 2010.   In the case of evasion of excise duty, where the value of the excisable products involved in the offence is more that &euro;250,000, a fine of three times the value of the products may be imposed. Persons guilty of these offences are also liable to a custodial sentence of up to five years. The specific penalties imposed in any particular case are, of course, a matter for the Courts.  There are no proposals for further penalty increases at this time, but the position will be kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of practical experience of the operation of the increased fines provided for in the 2010 Act.</p></reply>

NAMA reimburses the NTMA the costs incurred by the NTMA in assigning staff and providing business and support services to NAMA.

Revenue has responded very aggressively to the threat posed to the exchequer and to legitimate business by this criminal activity and has a comprehensive action plan in place to tackle the problem.  The key elements of the Revenue strategy are: more effective monitoring and control of the mineral oil distribution chain; robust and sustained enforcement action; and cooperation with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK.</p><p>  A number of legislative provisions have been made, in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act and in Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Regulations, to underpin and support Revenue&rsquo;s monitoring and control of the fuel supply chain, to make it more difficult for launderers to source marked fuel for laundering and to supply laundered fuel to retail outlets.  The existing requirement for traders, who sell, deliver or deal in any other way with road fuels, to be licensed by Revenue is extended by the Finance Act, from 1 October this year, to traders who deal with marked diesel and marked kerosene.  Road fuel and marked fuel may only be delivered from a premises or place for which the appropriate licence is in force or, in the case of cross-border deliveries, under the appropriate intra-EU procedures.</p><p>  All licences are subject to conditions set by Revenue relating to the security and suitability of the premises or place concerned.  A licence must be refused where an applicant cannot satisfy Revenue that those conditions can be met, does not hold a tax clearance certificate, or has, in the previous ten years, been guilty of an indictable tax offence.  A licence may be revoked for failure to satisfy the specified conditions, on conviction for an indictable tax offence, or for any breach of excise law in relation to dealings with mineral oil.</p><p>  The Mineral Oil Tax Regulations 2012 support and complement these Finance Bill provisions by setting down detailed procedures for deliveries of mineral oil, and for the keeping of records relating to those deliveries, and all mineral oil at the licensed premises or place.  All deliveries must be carried out under a delivery document procedure, with copies to be held by that consignor, the consignee, and the person in charge of the delivery vehicle. There is a simplified procedure for small-scale deliveries to private individuals.  A requirement is also introduced for a monthly electronic return to be made by mineral oil traders, setting out the details of their dealings in mineral oil.  These new control requirements will come into operation on 1 January 2013, when the necessary systems and administrative arrangements, for the fuel traders and Revenue, are in place.  The new Regulations also clarify the requirements for the records to be kept by the trader and made available to Revenue.  The information from these delivery documents, returns and other records will provide Revenue with information essential to checks and audits at all points in the fuel supply chain, and the identification of suspect deliveries and anomalous transactions.</p><p>  Revenue is committed to applying more of its compliance resources to combating the illicit trade in mineral oil, and continues to apply a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils.  These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; closure of unlicensed or improperly licensed outlets and seizure of stock, and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.</p><p>  In 2011 nine oil laundries and 327,000 litres of laundered fuel were seized, together with nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles.  Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the DPP, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of five of these cases and on summary disposal in a further case.  In addition, over 718,000 litres of illicit fuel has been seized, the bulk of it at, or in the course of delivery to, retail outlets.  To date in 2012 six oil laundries and 135,050 litres of fuel has been seized together with one oil tanker and nine other vehicles.  Two people were arrested in the course of these operations. In addition to this over 548,000 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the bulk of it at, or in the course of delivery to retail outlets.  There have been two court convictions for laundered oil offences with a fine of &euro;2,500 imposed in one case and a two-year suspended sentence in the other.</p><p>  Revenue is also engaged in an ongoing and vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and challenging of instances of non-compliance. In 2011 thirty-two filling stations were shut down by Revenue because they did not have a licence or were in breach of licensing conditions. To date in 2012, twenty-seven such outlets have been closed.</p><p>  Revenue enforcement is carried on in close cooperation with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) by sharing intelligence and identifying and investigating the criminals involved in fuel fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HMRC have been working in partnership to identify a new fuel marker that will be more resistant to fuel laundering, and a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the two authorities.  A joint invitation for proposals was published in June and a joint information seminar was held for potential applicants on 24 July.  Both authorities are committed to seeking the widest possible range of proposals, so that the most effective marker for the future can be identified. </p></reply>

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they place particular emphasis on developing their intelligence base through a strong risk analysis focus at national and regional level and by deploying their resources to areas of highest risk.</p><p>  To assist in its drugs enforcement intelligence and operational development at international level Revenue has assigned a Europol Liaison Officer to Europol Headquarters, a Revenue attach&eacute; in London and a Country Liaison Officer to the Maritime Operations and Analysis Centre &ndash; Narcotics in Lisbon. Officers from Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Drug Law Enforcement Unit also liaise nationally and internationally with other law enforcement agencies to prevent, detect and intercept drugs destined for European and Irish markets and implement intelligence-led joint Revenue and law enforcement operations at European, national and regional level.  At national level Revenue has signed over forty-three Memoranda of Understanding with various groups and organisations involved in the maritime sector and with international travel and trade service providers.</p><p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Drugswatch Programme assists in the monitoring of our coastline and airfields through its coastal and airfield reporting mechanism.  This allows members of the public, including maritime communities etc., to notify in confidence suspect and/or unusual movements at sea or around the coast directly or through the Drugswatch Freefone.  Revenue have permanent staff based at strategic locations and ports throughout the country.  Also Revenue officers patrol the coastline including the harbours and piers.  These patrols are selective and targeted and based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.</p><p>  In terms of maritime surveillance there are currently two Revenue Cutters in service and these support Revenue&rsquo;s teams of land-based enforcement officers involved in anti-smuggling duties.  These Cutters are deployed to cover high risk/threat areas along the coastline and by their nature the timing and location of surveillance patrols are confidential.  Additionally, Revenue officers, as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction continue to work proactively with the assistance of the Irish Naval Service and Aer Corps and engage in maritime surveillance and operations aimed at identifying, monitoring and intercepting vessels suspected of drug smuggling.  As part of the task force, nation-wide liaison at national and local level between nominated Revenue and Garda officers takes place to exchange information and to pool intelligence on drugs smuggling.</p><p>  This pooling of intelligence between the agencies at national and international level accords with best worldwide practice and enhances the focus on counteracting drug trafficking and the dismantling of drug organisations.  To date, operations involving the enforcement agencies have proved successful in the detection of drugs and the successful prosecution of the smugglers and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the current arrangements for maritime and coastal surveillance are sufficient and effective.</p></reply>

Where crested and official primary school uniforms meet the criteria of children&rsquo;s clothing then they will be subject to the zero rate, if not then the standard VAT rate applies.  There is no special VAT treatment of crested and official primary school uniforms distinct from the VAT treatment of children&rsquo;s clothing.   Specifically, the zero rate applies to the supply of children&rsquo;s personal clothing of sizes that do not exceed the sizes of those articles appropriate to children of average build of 10 years of age, in accordance with paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 2 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The articles of clothing must be described, labeled, marked or marketed on the basis of age or size and fur or partly fur skin clothing is excluded.  The criteria for clothing size used by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of the zero rating are that children&rsquo;s clothing must be of sizes up to and including 32&rdquo; chest or 26&rdquo; waist.  Where crested and official school uniforms meet these conditions then the zero rate will apply to their supply.</p></reply>

At the outset, it is important to note that the Revenue Commissioners do not regulate accountants.  Accordingly, where a taxpayer engages the services of an accountant   in relation to taxation matters, that contractual relationship is a private one between the taxpayer and the accountant &ndash; the Revenue Commissioners are not involved.</p><p>  Failures by accountants to provide the services their clients contract with them to provide are, in the main, matters to be resolved between accountants and their clients.  If an accountant&rsquo;s failure to correctly deal with a taxpayer&rsquo;s tax matters results in adverse consequences for the taxpayer, it would be a matter for the taxpayer to consider what redress he or she would have against the accountant in law and/or whether he or she would have a basis for making a complaint to the accountant&rsquo;s professional representative body.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will consider all factors leading to any adverse tax consequence, but it is important to note that the Revenue Commissioners will not relieve a taxpayer of an adverse tax consequence solely on the grounds that an accountant was in some way responsible.   Engaging an accountant does not relieve a taxpayer of responsibility of taking the necessary care to ensure that his or her tax matters are correctly dealt with.   If a taxpayer is in any doubt as to the correctness of the handling of any particular aspect of his or her tax matters, appropriate enquiries can be made to Revenue, whether by contacting the appropriate Revenue office or, where relevant, by accessing the taxpayer&rsquo;s tax record through the Revenue On-line service (ROS) or PAYE Anytime.</p></reply>

It has a range of functions providing asset and liability management services to Government.  These include borrowing for the Exchequer and management of the National Debt, the State Claims Agency, the New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA), the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), and the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p><p><br />  The NTMA reports directly to the Minister for Finance in the performance of its funding and debt management, State Claims Agency and NewERA functions. Each of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the National Development Finance Agency and the National Asset Management Agency has its own board.  The NTMA has an Advisory Committee to assist and advise on such matters as are referred to the Committee by the NTMA.  The NTMA acts as the executive in respect of the NPRF and the NDFA.   In the case of NAMA it assigns staff to NAMA and also provides it with business and support services and systems.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA for the cost of these staff and services from its operations.</p><p><br />  The NTMA&#8217;s net costs in 2011 were &#8364;41.2m.  Of this &#8364;3.7m related to its functions in respect of the NPRF and &#8364;5.9m to its functions in respect of the NDFA.  NAMA&#8217;s total administration expenses in 2011 were &#8364;128.4m<i>,</i>  including fees of &#8364;57m paid to participating institutions for the servicing of NAMA loans.  These costs are met from NAMA&#8217;s operations.  The fees and expenses incurred in the operation of the NPRF in 2011 (other than the costs incurred by the NTMA set out above) were &#8364;17.2m. These costs are met from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The administrative expenses incurred in the operation of the NDFA in 2011 (other that the costs incurred by the NTMA set out above) were &#8364;0.081m. These costs are met from the Central Fund.</p><p><br />  The <b>Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC)</b>  is a statutory committee established under Section 180 of the Credit Union Act 1997 to advise the Minister for Finance on matters relating to credit unions.  The work of this Committee is ongoing in nature and the Committee is to remain in place.  The cost of the CUAC in 2011 was &#8364;23,356 and the estimate of expenditure for 2012 is &#8364;18,000. </p><p><br />  The <b>Credit Union Restructuring Board</b> (<b>ReBo</b>) was established on an administrative basis on 31st August 2012 pending the enactment of the Credit Union Bill 2012, when it will become a Statutory Body.  Its work is to facilitate and support the restructuring of credit unions and it is to remain in place until 31 December 2015.  The ReBo is to hold its first meeting on 28th September 2012.  After that it will be in a position to formulate its work plan and outline its proposed cost.  The Rebo will be funded jointly by the State and the Credit Union Sector.</p><p><br />  Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal: the Revised Estimates provision for 2012 is &#8364;330,000 and there are no plans to merge this body.</p><p><br />  Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, set up in July 2011: 2011 outturn - &#8364;222,000, 2012 allocation - &#8364;650,000.</p></reply>

As I stated on Budget day, the primary purpose of the Budget was to support the creation and retention of jobs in the short term, the medium term and the long term.  This has to be balanced with the need to restore public finances to a sound footing.  I would like to point out that employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available.  This makes it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.  Having said that, I think it is fair to say that there are tentative signs of stabilisation in labour market conditions.  For instance, the latest data from the Live Register showed an annual decrease of 13,457 (-2.9%) people on the Live Register in August.  This helped to reduce the unemployment rate to 14.7 per cent, although clearly this remains way too high.</p><p><br />  So, leaving aside the fact that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures targeted at job creation for the different sectors of the economy in Budget 2012, as well as the measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment.  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the labour market difficulties remains the Governments biggest challenge and, accordingly, Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.</p></reply>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.483" nospeaker="true" ><p>Credit Union Restructuring Board (Rebo)

  As recommended in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions published on 18 April 2012, the ReBo is being established on a time-bound basis to facilitate and support the restructuring of Credit Unions.   On 31st August 2012, the Minister for Finance appointed thirteen (13) members to the Rebo.  They are:

Mr. Robert (Bobby) McVeigh &#8211; Chairman

Mr. Eoin McGettigan

Mr. Tom Kavanagh

Mr. Brendan Burke

Ms Kathleen Prendergast

Mr. Stephen O&#8217;Donovan

Mr. Joe O&#8217;Toole

Mr. Pat Fay &#8211; Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU)

Mr. Jimmy Johnstone &#8211; Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU)

Mr. Tim Molan &#8211; Credit Union Managers Association (CUMA)

Mr. Kevin Johnson &#8211; Credit Union Development Association (CUDA)

Mr. Neil Ryan &#8211; Assistant Secretary, Financial Services Division, Department of Finance

Ms Elaine Byrne &#8211; Deputy Head, Registrar of Credit Unions

Fees are &#8364;11,970 per annum to the Chair and &#8364;7,695 per annum to ordinary members.

The Rebo has not yet met and no expenses have yet been paid. It is intended that expenses will be paid in accordance with standard public guidelines and procedures.

*The Minister does not make appointments to the Board of IBRC. While the Minister as sole shareholder has an &#8220;approval&#8221; role and may nominate persons to the Board, the Board actually makes the appointments. Two new Directors are due to be appointed this month whose fees, we expect, will be in the region of &#8364;73k PA. I am not aware at this point if either new appointee will take up a position as chair of any of the various committees.</p></speech>

All instances of alleged unauthorised activity that come to the attention of the Central Bank are investigated in full and action is taken where necessary and appropriate.  However, due to confidentiality provisions as set out in Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act, 1942, as amended, the Central Bank cannot disclose details, to a third party, of any individual investigation it may undertake.</p><p>  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, as amended, does not contain a provision for the authorisation or supervision by the Central Bank of a &quot;mortgage lender&quot;.  Certain firms which take deposits and which act as a &quot;mortgage lender&quot; require an authorisation from the Central Bank as a &quot;retail credit firm&quot; (non-deposit taking lender that provides credit in the form of cash loans to individuals in the State) pursuant to the provisions contained in Part V of the Central Bank Act, 1997, as amended.  However, the regime for the authorisation and supervision of a &quot;retail credit firm&quot; only came into effect in Irish law on 1 February 2008.  Prior to this date, firms which operated as a non-deposit taking lender did not require any authorisation.</p><p>  There are a number of exclusions contained in the definition of a &quot;retail credit firm&quot; which certain firms may be in a position to avail of and, as such, certain firms are excluded from the requirement to become authorised as a &quot;retail credit firm&quot; by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has also informed me that the Bank has a number of roles and responsibilities with respect to the operation and enforcement of Part IX  (Housing Loans made by Mortgage Lenders) of the Credit Consumer Act 1995. For example, the Central Bank authorises &quot;mortgage intermediaries&quot; for the purposes of that Act. In addition, the Bank is responsible for enforcing various provisions contained in that Part. The Consumer Credit Act 1995 is a &quot;designated enactment&quot; with the result that those &quot;regulated financial service providers&quot; for the purposes of the Central Bank Act 1942 with respect to Part IX of that Act  may be subject to the Bank's administrative sanctions regime.</p></reply>

It provided long term equity release for people over the age of 65. It was a way of unlocking part of the value of your property, without having to move home. The amount a customer could borrow depended primarily on their age and the value of the property in question.  No repayments are required on the loan until one of the following events occur:</p><p>1. The property is sold</p><p>2. The death of the borrower (In joint cases, the last surviving borrower)</p><p>3. The property is vacated for six months or more (In joint cases, by the last surviving borrower).</p><p>  As the maximum loan to value available was 30% of the house value, the incidence of potential negative equity in these cases is not material.  Notwithstanding this, where a repayment event occurs, the Bank&rsquo;s recourse is limited to the market value of the property at the point of sale. The borrower or their estate has no liability for any potential shortfall following sale.  I have been informed that as no payments are required during the term of the loan, by definition it cannot accrue arrears and as a result the product does not fall within the scope of the Bank&rsquo;s MARS strategies.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. </p><p>  The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p><p>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed.  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year&#8217;s Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</p><p><b>Index of Tables and Notes</b></p><p>a) Note on the Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009 </p><p>b) Table IT 6 showing Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009. Figures of cost in relation to corporation tax are included in the &#8220;<b>Income Tax and/or Corporation Tax</b>  &#8221; section of this table.</p><p>c) Notes on Table IT 6</p><p>d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions</p><p>e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009</p><p>f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.</p><p><br />  Work is ongoing to update the costs to 2010 terms but this is not yet complete.</p><p><b>a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</b></p><p>The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.</p><p><br />  An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p><p><br />  The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p><p><br />  In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the &#8220;costs&#8221; of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a &#8220;loss of tax revenue&#8221; on profits. To compute such &#8220;loss&#8221;, regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p><p><br />  The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p><p><br />  The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p><p><br />  The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p><p><br />  The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p><p><br />  In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with &#8364;1,000 gross trading profits, &#8364;1,000 capital allowances and &#8364;1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on &#8364;1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on &#8364;1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p><p><br />  The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p><p><br />  Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007. The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.</p><p><br />  Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. </p></reply>

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.</p><p>(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.</p><p>(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.</p><p>(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a &ldquo;net pay&rdquo; basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.</p><p>(6) See the following note on &ldquo;Green Paper on Pensions&rdquo; for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures.</p><p>(7) &ldquo;Other&rdquo; relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership.</p><p>(8) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.</p><p>(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.</p><p>(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.</p><p>(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.</p><p>(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.</p><p>(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with &ldquo;unused capital allowances&rdquo;, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company&rsquo;s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that &euro;3587 million and &euro;5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</p><p>(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.</p><p>(15) the cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least &euro;100m.</p><p>(16) The costs shown for R&amp;D is for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009.

The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</p><p>The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.</p><p>The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie.</p><p><b>e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009</b></p><p>Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax - uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns</p><p>Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns.

This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.

The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.   A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level. An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &mdash; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &mdash; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers. There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.</p><p>  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 to &euro;75,000 and confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &euro;540 million.	</p></reply>

Under Irish tax legislation a company incurring a trading loss in an accounting year can carry that loss back for offset against profits in the immediately preceding year. The carry back of a trading loss is limited to one accounting year back and there must be profits in that year for the provision to be of use to a company. A trading loss in an accounting year may also be carried forward for offset against trading profits of the same trade in subsequent years. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the potential saving to the Exchequer, if future claims by incorporated bodies for losses to be offset against previous year&rsquo;s profits were to be disallowed, would depend on the amounts of losses incurred by companies and the extent to which there are profits in the preceding accounting year against which such losses would otherwise be available for set-off. It is not possible to anticipate what these would be.</p><p>  By way of illustrating this latter point, data from corporation tax returns for 2009 and 2010 (the latest years available) show that for 2009 the amount of trading losses carried back for offset against profits earned in a previous year was &euro;868m while the comparable figure for 2010 was a much lower figure in the region of &euro;445m. The actual saving to the Exchequer in respect of those years under the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would depend on the tax rate applicable to the profits of the companies concerned but assuming that this was the standard 12.5% rate, the savings under the proposal would have amounted to about &euro;109m in 2009 and about &euro;56m in 2010. The Deputy should note, however, that the estimated savings for 2009 and 2010 are not necessarily indicative of what the savings might be for future years. Also, since under the proposal companies could continue to carry forward losses for offset against future profits, the estimated Exchequer savings outlined would be temporary in nature.</p><p>  I should add that losses incurred in a trade are a fact of business life and the provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and that of all other countries in the OECD. It would be difficult to justify taxing business income without taking due account of business losses.</p></reply>

If relief for these deductions and reliefs was confined to the standard rate of income tax the saving to the Exchequer could be of the order of &euro;1,000 million.   This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a change or the economic effect of such a change. This applies in particular to the BES, Film Relief and Capital Allowances regime. The standard rating of employee pension reliefs would also have an impact on workers&rsquo; take home pay.</p><p>It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced. For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, the BES was re-launched as the Employment and Investment Incentive, with changes to the amount of relief payable and types of companies that can qualify.</p><p><table><tr><th><div> Tax Relief Provision</div></th><th><div>Total 2009 Cost</div></th><th>Saving if Standard<br />Rated </th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td><td><div>&#8364;m</div></td></tr><tr><td>Person Taking Care of Incapacitated Taxpayer </td><td><div>5.9</div></td><td><div>2.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Health Expenses (Nursing Homes) </td><td><div>23.1</div></td><td><div>6.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Contributions Under Permanent Health Benefit Schemes, after Deduction of Tax on Benefits Received</td><td><div>3.9</div></td><td><div>1.6 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions To Approved Superannuation Schemes </td><td><div>729.0</div></td><td><div>345.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Premiums </td><td><div>237.2</div></td><td><div>105.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts </td><td><div>77.0</div></td><td><div>26.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Interest paid relating to borrowings for  purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties</td><td><div>26.5 </div></td><td><div>11.6 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Expenses Allowable to Employees under Schedule E</td><td><div>73.7</div></td><td><div>27.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Relief for certain Sports Persons.</td><td><div>0.2</div></td><td><div>0.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Job Assist allowance</td><td><div>0.3</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Allowance for seafarers</td><td><div>0.2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Investment in Corporate Trades (BES) </td><td><div>25.6</div></td><td><div>13.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Investment in Seed Capital</td><td><div>2.9</div></td><td><div>1.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Stock Relief </td><td><div>2.0</div></td><td><div>0.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Relief for expenditure on significant buildings and gardens</td><td><div>4.6</div></td><td><div>2.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donation of Heritage items </td><td><div>0.7</div></td><td><div>0.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donation of Heritage  property to the Irish Heritage Trust</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donations to Approved Bodies (Income Tax only) </td><td><div>51.11</div></td><td><div>19.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donations to Sports Bodies (Income Tax only). </td><td><div>0.6</div></td><td><div>0.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Capital Allowances (Income Tax only)</td><td><div>1,004.9</div></td><td><div>395.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Rented Residential Relief -Section 23 </td><td><div>46.9</div></td><td><div>24.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Investment in Films </td><td><div>42.0</div></td><td><div>25.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div> 2,358.3 </div></td><td><div>   1,009.7 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on information regarding the cost of the Mid-Shannon Scheme, which has been received and collated for the tax year 2010, the latest year for which data is available, the annual yield to the Exchequer from the abolition of this relief could be in the region of &euro;0.2 million.

This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. </p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. </p><p>  It is estimated that the full year yield from the taxation of remote betting would be around &euro;20 million.  Therefore a straight line calculation of the 5% suggested by the Deputy would suggest a yield of &euro;100 million.  However this would not take account of the impact of such a rate on betting activity or any other variables.</p></reply>

To estimate the potential revenue from such a wealth tax, we would need to identify the wealth held by individuals.  I am informed by the Central Statistics Office that the institutional sector accounts do not give an indication of the number of households or persons classified by the categories of wealth they hold.  These statistics are based on aggregate information collected from financial institutions and do not contain the demographic details which would enable such a breakdown of the statistics.  So while the CSO&#8217;s institutional sector accounts show that households held c. &#8364;126 billion on deposit in 2010, this is not broken down by income or wealth categories.</p><p><br />  However, I understand that, following discussions between the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform, the CSO and the Central Bank, the CSO has commenced a &#8220;Household Finance and Consumption Survey&#8221;, which will include, <i>inter alia</i>  , a survey of wealth.  The first results of this survey will be available in 2014.  The data to be collected by the CSO as part of this survey is primarily targeted as general information on the financial situation and behaviour of households.

The scheme is intended to help retail clients and does not cover institutions or professional clients.  The Official Liquidator of Custom House Capital Limited is currently reconciling all client investments held through Custom House Capital Limited.  This will be a lengthy and complex process.  Until this reconciliation process is fully completed it will not be possible to quantify the extent of losses for each individual client.  The Investor Compensation Company Limited (ICCL) operates the scheme that pays compensation where an authorised firm is unable due to financial circumstances to return money or investment instruments owed to a client.  Investors will be compensated if they are eligible investors only.  The limits to the amounts payable in compensation is 90% of the amount lost, subject to a maximum of 20,000 euro, to each eligible investor.   </p><p><br />  Custom House Capital Limited has approximately 1,500 clients, the majority of whom are resident in the State.  Until the reconciliation process currently underway by the Official Liquidator is complete, it will not be possible to determine the number of investors affected.  The Central Bank has advised that in July 2011, it received new information, previously unknown, which increased the Central Bank's concerns regarding the integrity of client investments managed by Custom House Capital Limited.  The Central Bank then decided to impose further directions on the firm and in July 2011 to seek the appointment of High Court Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the firm.    </p><p><br />  No amount of skilled supervision or enhanced audit can absolutely guarantee that determined and deliberately concealed efforts to misuse client holdings can be prevented.  Section 33AJ (2) of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides that the Central Bank can not be held liable for damages <i>&quot;for anything done or omitted in the performance or purported performance or exercise of any of its functions or powers, unless it is proved that the act or omission was in bad faith&quot;.</i></p></reply>

Up to 31 December 2011 admissions to historic houses and gardens, and open farms were treated for VAT purposes as lettings and regarded as exempt from VAT.  Having regard to certain decisions of the European Court of Justice, where a letting was defined for VAT purposes, it was decided that such admissions could no longer be treated as exempt lettings.  As there are no other provisions in the VAT Directive that would allow an exemption from VAT on admissions to visitor farms, such admission became subject to VAT from 1 January 2012.  Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides an exemption for the provision of children's or young people's education by educational establishments recognised by the State.  This exemption does not extend to admissions to visitor farms for educational school tours.  While admissions to visitor farms became liable to VAT from 1 January, provision was made in the Finance Act 2012 to ensure that such admissions apply at the 9% reduced rate of VAT and not the standard 23% VAT rate.</p></reply>

Based on the Agency's record to date, I have no reason to doubt that the Agency will achieve its targets over its lifetime.  In relation to Section 225 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the Deputy will be aware that a surcharge may be applied to the participating institutions only in the event of underlying losses being incurred by NAMA over its lifetime.  The provision does not operate until the conclusion of NAMA's operations and the overall position of the taxpayer will be taken into account when considering the application of any surcharge. </p><p>  As indicated in the answer to PQ 38494/12 the 2020 date referred to the winding up of the loan book not the winding up of the bank.  At this stage, I would regard it as premature to speculate as to the respective dates on which NAMA and IBRC may be dissolved and on the mechanism by which a surcharge would be applied if IBRC were to be dissolved first.  This is particularly the case given, as I have indicated above, that there is no reason to expect that it will be necessary to invoke Section 225 of the Act.</p></reply>

Whilst significant progress has been made the final position will be driven by a number of variable factors against the assumptions in IBRC's wind down plan.  These factors include actual recovery rates achieved for assets, the performance of the domestic and global economies, and the prevailing interest rates in Europe over the duration of the plan.   </p><p>  The bank's policy is that, due to the commercially sensitive nature of such information as noted above combined with the many external variables involved, it does not issue formal projections.    However, the Bank's CEO has given an indication previously that the likely outcome for Anglo Irish Bank would be in the &euro;25 - &euro;28 billion region.  The bank have informed me that since this time there have been a number of changes in market circumstance, the accelerated pace of asset disposal, and the acquisition of Irish Nationwide Building Society.  While not issuing a revised projection as noted above, the bank remains of the view that there will be a small return to the State at full resolution, given the assumptions currently being used. </p><p>  Further in relation to inclusion of interest in the projected ultimate outturn I have been advised that in calculating the projected final net asset position IBRC take into account interest from all assets including customers, securities and Promissory Notes.</p></reply>

Any attempt to reverse our approach now would be counterproductive, especially in view of the critical role to be played by Ireland during our upcoming Presidency.

The Pact refers to a commitment by Member States to engage in structured discussions on tax policy issues, for example, to ensure the exchange of best practices, and fight against fraud and tax evasion while acknowledging that direct taxation remains a national competence.  There is no commitment in the Pact on CCCTB. It simply says that: &quot;Developing a common corporate tax base could be a revenue neutral way forward to ensure consistency among national tax systems while respecting national tax strategies, and to contribute to fiscal sustainability and the competitiveness of European businesses.  The Commission has presented a legislative proposal on a common consolidated corporate tax base&quot;.

These include restructured loans. NAMA estimates that the loan restructures enhance the proportion of loans classified as performing loans by 2%.  It should be noted that this classification of performance is primarily by reference to legacy loan facility obligations.  It should be noted that the 19% cited above, translates to 29% by reference to acquired loan value.</p><p>  NAMA advises that one of its key objectives is to manage its debtors and receivers so as to capture, for debt servicing purposes, income (principally rental income) from their property assets.  Such income capture was not widespread prior to NAMA's acquisition of the loans and NAMA has launched a major drive to achieve this objective. NAMA measures its performance, in part, by the extent to which it captures such income on an on-going basis and not wholly on the extent to which a debtor is in compliance with the terms of legacy loan facility arrangements which predate NAMA loan acquisition.</p><p>  Please also refer to Section 22.5 of the Annual Report for further information regarding the credit quality of loans and receivables.</p></reply>

The EU/IMF programme provides funding to the end of 2013.

In that context, it has announced plans to provide loan finance of up to &euro;2 billion over the next four years in commercial and residential assets located in the State, subject to identifying commercially viable projects from among those controlled by its debtors and receivers.  NAMA may, where appropriate, enter into joint venture arrangements on certain projects.  To date, NAMA has approved advances in Ireland of over &euro;610 million to complete projects in residential, commercial, retail, leisure, and healthcare sectors and almost &euro;400 million of this has been drawn down. </p><p>  At this stage, NAMA is engaged with its debtors and receivers in the process of identifying projects which may be commercially suitable for development with a view to meeting prospective market requirements over a medium-term horizon and, in the light of this evaluation, its Board will determine its project financing plans.  NAMA is also reviewing existing planning permissions and, where appropriate, will engage with planning authorities, through its debtors/receivers or directly, in cases where modifications may be required to render projects commercially feasible.</p></reply>

Credit institutions are subject to the MiFID Regulations when providing services in such instruments.  The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the supervision of such activities when they are provided to clients.  Clients can be categorised as retail, professional or eligible counterparties.  The recent incidents of alleged interest rate misselling in the UK appear mainly to directly involve professional or eligible counterparty clients.  There are less onerous conduct of business obligations on the level of protections to be applied to professional or eligible counterparties than to retail clients.  For example, eligible counterparties are not subject to the best execution protections.</p><p>  The Central Bank is currently mapping the MiFID services being provided by credit institutions with a view to ensuring that the best interests of consumers of financial instruments are protected and that the integrity of the market is upheld.  In this context issues such as those raised by the Deputy will be considered and dealt with accordingly.</p></reply>

Up until this year, the Central Bank has published them  on my behalf as part of its statistical review of the insurance industry.  For 2011, I am proposing shortly to publish the accounts on my Department's website.  I will also lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The accounts outline amongst other things the amounts owing the ICF by all the companies under administration, i.e. Icarom plc (under administration), Primor plc (under administration) and Quinn Insurance Ltd (under administration).  It is expected that the ICF will not have to advance any more funds to Primor, and the only funds that it will have to advance to Icarom relates to the last tranche of money due from AIB under the 20 year agreement negotiated in 1992 whereby they agreed to pay just over 11m euro a year to the Administrator. </p><p>  With regard to Quinn Insurance Ltd (QIL) to date 786 million euro has been paid out of the fund to the QIL Joint Administrators of which 730m euro has been advanced by the State.  The balance of 56m euro is made up of 40m euro in the fund at the time the call was first made and 16m euro from the first quarter 2012 ICF levy.</p><p>  In relation to future calls upon the ICF the Deputy is aware that the Joint Administrators indicated to the High Court that they may have to seek up to 1.65bn euro from the Insurance Compensation Fund in order to fully discharge their administration obligations.  It should be noted that they have qualified this by saying that for accounting reasons the projected call upon the fund now includes considerable contingencies that it is hoped will not be called upon.  Consequently they believe that if they were to remove most of these accounting adjustments and use a &quot;best estimate&quot; calculation, then the call on the fund is likely to be in the range of 1.1bn-euro1.3bn euro rather than the 1.65bn euro for which they have provided.</p><p>  What this means for future projections of the ICF is that there is likely to be a requirement for the State to advance further significant sums to the ICF in 2013 to meet the cost of the Quinn administration, and perhaps lesser amounts in 2014 because of the front loaded nature of QIL's liability profile and as the ICF levy is only likely to generate in the region of 65m euro to 75m euro a year.  The Central Bank is responsible for managing the financial well-being of the Fund and the exact amount to be advanced will be determined taking account of the recommendation I receive from it under Section 5 of the 1964 Insurance Act.  Finally, the Deputy should note that the QIL Joint Administrators have to seek High Court approval for their drawdowns from the ICF and monies are lodged by me to the fund only as a need for a drawdown arises.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that my Department has engaged extensively with the Central Bank on issues relating to the QIL administration.  In June of this year I wrote to the Central Bank   to express my concern about the increasing call on the ICF and to obtain the views of the Bank on the performance of the administration.  In its reply the Bank indicated that it had no grounds for regulatory concerns with how the Joint Administrators have discharged their responsibilities.  The Central Bank also indicated that in their opinion the Joint Administrators have undertaken a robust review in arriving at their revised estimate of the call on the Fund and that the increase in the potential call arises primarily from business written by QIL prior to the appointment of the Joint Administrators, particularly between 2007 &amp; 2010.  The work of the Joint Administrators to date confirmed the major cause of the deficit is attributable to under reserving by QIL during the period up until it was placed in administration. </p><p>  The Joint Administrators have also advised me that they are currently exploring whether there is a right of legal action for professional negligence against QIL's former auditors and signing actuaries.  They will report further to me on this issue in due course.</p></reply>

This was because the preference share investments in both banks are unlisted and because it is difficult to establish a fair value for ordinary shares in Allied Irish Banks given that the Fund holds 99.8% of those shares.  Based on the advice of Goodbody Corporate Finance, the Commission valued the Allied Irish Banks ordinary shares at &euro;0.0076 (0.76 cent) per share and valued the preference share investment in Allied Irish Banks at 63.5% of cost.  This gives a total value for the Fund's shareholding in Allied Irish Banks of &euro;6.1 billion at end-2011 (&euro;2.2 billion preference shares and &euro;3.9 billion ordinary shares).</p><p>  The Fund's ordinary share holding in Bank of Ireland was valued at its market price of &euro;0.082 (8.2 cents) per share at 31 December 2011.  The holding of preference shares was value at 80.2% of cost, on the advice of Goodbody Corporate Finance.  This gives a total value for the Fund's shareholding in Bank of Ireland of &euro;1.9 billion at end-2011 (&euro;1.5 billion preference shares and &euro;0.4 billion ordinary shares).  The Minister for Finance invested &euro;2.3 billion in Permanent TSB (formerly Irish Life and Permanent) in July 2011 in return for 36,249,014,972 ordinary shares (at an issue price of &euro;0.06345 per share).  The shares are held at their nominal value in the Finance Accounts.  The State shareholding in Permanent TSB stands at 99.24%.</p></reply>

Information relating to individuals who were subject to the restriction in 2011 will only start to be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners in November 2012 when taxpayers file their tax returns for 2011.   Following receipt of the 2011 tax returns, it will be necessary for the Revenue Commissioners to extract and analyse information relating to individuals who were subject to the restriction before they will be in a position to commence work on the compilation of the 2011 report.  I expect to receive the 2011 report around the middle of 2013.  The most recent report by the Revenue Commissioners analysing the high income individuals&#8217; restriction is in respect of the 2010 tax year. This report, which was published by my Department on 1 August 2012 and is available on the Department&#8217;s Tax Policy website <i></i>, reflects the changes made to the restriction in Finance Act 2010. Those changes extended the restriction to a greater number of individuals by reducing the income threshold at which the restriction applies from &#8364;250,000 to &#8364;125,000 and by reducing the relief threshold from &#8364;250,000 to &#8364;80,000.  The objective of these changes was to achieve an average effective rate of income tax of 30 per cent where the restriction applies in full.  This effective rate does not include amounts payable in respect of PRSI and other levies and charges i.e. the Income Levy and Health Levy which applied in the tax year 2010 and the Universal Social Charge which applies from the tax year 2011.  </p><p><br />  The 2010 report indicates that the number of individuals who were subject to the restriction in that year increased to 1,544, up from 452 in 2009.  The additional tax payable by these individuals because of the restriction was &#8364;80.18 million, up from &#8364;38.86 million in 2009.  This additional tax represents almost a doubling of the tax that would otherwise have been payable if the restriction had not applied.</p><p><br />  No significant changes have been made to the restriction since 2010.  However, in Finance Act 2011, the successor to the Business Expansion Scheme i.e. the Employment and Investment Incentive, was added to the list of reliefs covered by the restriction.  Likewise, in Finance Act 2012, the new relief introduced under section 12 of that Act, in relation to income earned in certain foreign states, was also added to the list of restricted reliefs.  Additionally, a technical amendment relating to the calculation of balancing charges was made by section 16 of the Finance Act 2012 to ensure that unused allowances coming forward from previous years are not treated as specified reliefs for the purposes of the restriction where they are netted-off against the gross amount of a balancing charge. </p><p><br />  Apart from these direct changes to the legislation dealing with the high income individuals&#8217; restriction, changes to individual reliefs that are subject to the restriction have also been made.  For example, under section 17 of the Finance Act 2011, the amount of exempt income that an artist can have disregarded for tax purposes was capped at a maximum of &#8364;40,000 with effect from the tax year 2011.  Finally, under section 3 of the Finance Act 2012, a surcharge of 5 per cent on income sheltered by property reliefs was introduced for taxpayers with an aggregate income of &#8364;100,000 or more.</p></reply>

For married individuals or civil partners, where either spouse or civil partner is aged 65 or over at any time during the tax year, the exemption limit is &#8364;36,000.    In the case of single persons, widowed persons, and married persons or civil partners assessed as single persons, who at any time during the tax year are aged 65 or over, the exemption limit is &#8364;18,000.  In addition, these exemption limits are increased by &#8364;575 in respect of each of the first 2 qualifying children and by &#8364;830 in respect of each subsequent qualifying child.</p><p><br />  The section also provides for marginal relief where an individual&#8217;s total income exceeds the exemption limit applicable to that individual, but does not exceed a sum equal to twice that limit.  Where marginal relief applies, the individual is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limits to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit. Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit, marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system. It should be noted, however, that where the individual&#8217;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system.  Exemption limits for persons aged less that 65 years ceased to apply with effect from 1 January 2008.  </p><p><br />  Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is deducted at the source from interest paid on most deposits held by Financial Institutions such as Banks, Building Societies, the Post Office Savings Bank and Credit Unions.  Where an individual, or an individual&#8217;s spouse or civil partner, is aged 65 or over during the tax year and, the indivdual&#8217;s income (or the joint income of the individual and his or her spouse or civil partner) is below the relevant annual exemption limit then he or she can apply directly to the financial institution concerned to have the interest paid without deduction of DIRT.  Further information on all tax credits, reliefs and exemptions for over 65s is available from the Revenue website at the following link:  <i> </i></p><p><br />  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost of the age exemption limits and the associated marginal relief, estimated by reference 2012 incomes, is provisionally estimated at &#8364;87 million. This is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.</p><p><br />  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that sufficiently detailed figures are not captured on the statutory return of Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) filed by financial institutions in such a way as to provide a basis for compiling estimates of the impact on the Exchequer from the DIRT exemption.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.778.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800068#WRS02000"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since 1 January 2012 Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is deducted at the rate of 30% from deposit interest. In addition a DIRT rate of 33% applies to interest that is not paid at annual or more frequent intervals or where the interest cannot be calculated until the maturity of the investment. This would include investments such as tracker bonds where the amount of interest payable depends on the changes in a financial or other index over a number of years.   The rates of DIRT have been increased on a number of occasions in recent years as shown in the table:</p><p><b>Historic DIRT Rates</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Period</th><th>Standard Rate</th><th>Non Standard Rate</th></tr><tr><td>1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011</td><td>27%</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>8 April 2009 to 31 December 2010</td><td>25%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>1 January 2009 to 7 April 2009</td><td>23%</td><td>26%</td></tr><tr><td>1 January 2002 to 31 December 2008</td><td>20%</td><td>23%</td></tr></table></p><p>DIRT is a non-refundable final income tax applied to deposit interest.  There are some cases where DIRT can be refunded or interest can be paid without deduction of DIRT, principally applying to deposit interest arising on accounts held by any of the following:</p><p>- an individual who (or whose spouse or civil partner) is aged 65 or over where their total income in a year (including the interest income) is below the annual exemption limit;</p><p>-an individual who (or whose spouse or civil partner) is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself and who is not liable</p><p>- to pay income tax because of the level of his or her income;</p><p>- individuals or companies who are not resident in Ireland, and</p><p>- companies (companies pay corporation tax at the rate of 25 per cent on any interest income earned).</p><p>The tax is deducted at source from any deposit interest paid or credited by a relevant deposit taker (e.g., a bank, building society, credit union, etc).  The rate of DIRT applicable is the rate in operation on the date the interest is paid or credited to the account.  It is estimated that the yield to the Exchequer from increasing the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) rate by five percentage points would be around &euro;95 million in a full year. This projection assumes no significant behavioral change by depositors or change in interest rates applied by financial institutions to savings.</p></reply>

Pension schemes or products are not regulated by the Central Bank but are separately regulated by the Pensions Board under the aegis of the Minister for Social Protection.    The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 is currently before the Oireachtas. The Bill strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions. It also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and will underpin the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice.  </p><p>  Section 37 of the Bill gives the Central Bank far-reaching powers of direction, which can be issued on grounds including where the regulated financial service provider is conducting business in such a manner as to jeopardise or prejudice monies held by or controlled by it on behalf of customers.  Section 40(2)(l) of the Bill provides the Central Bank with the power to make regulations setting out the standards to be met, and the procedures, systems and checks to be adopted, by regulated financial service providers for dealing with and holding the assets and money of customers.  This includes provisions on the safeguarding of customers&rsquo; rights, in particular in the event of insolvency; the use to which customers&rsquo; assets and money may be put; and the management of customer accounts.  </p><p>  Further changes to be proposed at Committee Stage of the Bill will provide further regulation-making powers to the Central Bank which are specifically targeted at enabling the Central Bank to support the protection of client assets.  These powers will facilitate communication between the Central Bank and customers and clients of a regulated financial service provider, which has been identified by the Central Bank as an important tool for investigations on compliance with client assets requirements.</p><p>  Section 45 of the Bill provides a means of restitution, via a Central Bank application to the High Court, where a person has been unjustly enriched or where others have suffered loss or other adverse effects arising from the commission of an offence or a prescribed contravention.  This provision is to be further enhanced at Committee Stage with a proposal which will make it applicable to managers who commit offences or prescribed contraventions.  Other proposed Committee Stage amendments will provide for customer redress and compensation mechanisms for consumers.</p><p>  In relation to investment firms, the Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) Regulations provide specific investor protections by setting out rules governing the relationship between investment firms and their clients. Proposals for revised MiFID legislation, currently under negotiations in the Council of the EU and in the European Parliament, aim to strengthen the protection of investors further.</p></reply>

The Deputy should be aware that the Exchequer is funded by tax and non-tax revenue and borrowings. No specific tranches of borrowing were undertaken solely for the purpose of recapitalising the banking sector. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately quantify that part of the debt servicing bill that relates to the borrowing undertaken to recapitalise the banks.   With regard to the amount of debt related interest that will be paid in 2013, the Stability Programme Update published in April 2012 provides the most recent estimates for debt interest expenditure.

Where an individual defrays the cost of health care over two or more years the individual can elect either to have the relief for the expenses allowed in the year in which the payment for the expenses was made or the year in which the health care was provided.</p><p><br />  Section 469 provides for the granting of relief in a tax year to the extent that the relief allowed reduces the individual&#8217;s tax liability for that year to nil.  It is not possible to apportion the cost of health care incurred in one year of assessment over a number of subsequent years to maximize the relief available, other than in circumstances where the payment for that care is paid by installments over the later years.</p><p><br />  Health expenses relief is only available for expenses that have been incurred by the individual which have not been reimbursed, directly or indirectly, from any other person or estate, any public authority or any contract of insurance or means of compensation.

SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of &euro;16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks&rsquo; deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion this year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.</p><p>  The Credit Review Office (CRO) reviews decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;500,000.

I would appeal to SMEs who have been refused credit by banks to avail of the services of the CRO.</p><p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act provides for a scheme which will facilitate up to &euro;40million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years.

Otherwise, there would be little reason to treat pension savings more favourably from a tax point of view than other general savings.</p><p>  A number of proposals have been made that individuals should be allowed access to their pension savings prior to retirement. Various rationales have been advanced to justify these proposals including that such access would allow those individuals to pay down mortgage and other debt and would otherwise provide a boost to economic activity.</p><p>  This is not a simple matter. During 2011, at the request of the Government&rsquo;s Economic Management Council (EMC), an Ad-hoc group was established under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Protection to consider the idea of allowing people to access their pension savings before pension age in order to assist them in paying down debt. The ad-hoc group presented a detailed report to the EMC in September 2011.   The conclusions of the Ad-hoc Group report were that:</p><p>- There is no evidence that, in general, the group likely to be most affected by mortgage debt (or other debt) has access to sufficient pension savings to make a difference to their situation.</p><p>- The legislative and administrative implications for such a scheme would be extremely complex and would appear excessive given the overall impact.</p><p>- Longer term difficulties whereby people are not making adequate provision for their retirement would be exacerbated, with potential for increased demands on the State. </p><p>- Individuals cashing in their pension savings now would get poor value in current circumstances which they would struggle to replace in the future.</p><p>  The &ldquo;Keane Group&rdquo; on mortgage arrears did not dispute these findings and early access to pension savings did not feature among the recommendations of that Group.</p><p>  A more general scheme of early access to pension savings would present significant problems in terms of the proper targeting of the use of accessed funds and controls over potential abuse.</p><p>  The tax treatment of pension savings for which I have responsibility is only one aspect of the broad policy of encouraging people to provide for an adequate income in retirement beyond the basic State pension. This policy area is the responsibility of my colleague, Ms Joan Burton TD, Minister for Social Protection, who I know is also aware of the proposals being made for early access to pension savings. The OECD is currently carrying out an independent review of long term pension policy in Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection. I have been advised, in response to a request from me in this matter, that the terms of reference of the independent review are such as to facilitate consideration of the issue of early access to pension savings and I would expect that the OECD review would deal with this issue.</p></reply>

This contained a valuation of the NPRF&rsquo;s ordinary and preference shareholdings in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank at 31st December 2011.  As at the 31st December the NPRF valuation of its investments in Irish banks stood at &euro;8 billion. Its investments in AIB at this date were valued at &euro;6.1bn comprising preference shares of &euro;2.2bn and ordinary shares of &euro;3.9bn.  Its investments in Bank of Ireland were valued at &euro;1.9bn consisting of preference shares of &euro;1.5bn and ordinary shares valued at &euro;0.4bn.  In addition, the State holds direct equity investments in IBRC and ptsb (now separated from Irish Life).  The State also invested &euro;3bn in contingent capital instruments across the banks which are scheduled to be repaid to the State in 2016. </p><p>  Given that the State may enter discussions in relation to these investments, it would be inappropriate for me at this point to provide further details in relation to any valuation assessment of those instruments. I would acknowledge though, that since the end of last year, banking shares have rallied strongly across Europe and the share price of Bank of Ireland has benefited from this positive sentiment rising by c18%.</p><p>  The very welcome Euro Area summit statement of 29th June represents a major shift in European policy in terms of breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign.  More recently with the announcement of single EU banking supervision mechanism on the 12th September, the European Commission President has outlined his vision for the banking sector, in which the ECB would be given supervisory powers over all banks in the union which is an important step in relation to the ESM and its potential to recapitalise banks.  As you aware, the Irish Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt and further detailed work will be stepped up to ensure that the positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer.  This will be one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities between now and the end of the year.</p></reply>

These key features assist in attracting a wider pool of investors which is beneficial both in terms of volume and price. Debt instruments based on esoteric assets are illiquid and difficult to price or value and may lead to significantly higher costs of borrowing.    The NTMA is open to developing new and innovative forms of debt investment, as evidenced by the recent issue of Amortising Bonds in response to demand from a particular cohort of investors, namely pension funds and annuity providers. However the agency is conscious that any non-standard bond issuance must be considered with the broader investor base in mind and must not deviate or be perceived to deviate from well-established principles and investor expectations. </p></reply>

Currently, there is a large range of engineering courses which are recognised for the purposes of the teaching of mathematics/applied mathematics. However, the experience of the Council is that many engineering programmes cover mathematical concepts in an engineering context and may not include, in sufficient depth, areas that are important for teaching purposes.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. </p><p><br />  All schools have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the coming school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  Where schools subsequently enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that these allocations were made, or where new medical conditions have arisen in the interim, schools may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support. </p><p><br />  I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy recently made a new application to the NCSE for additional SNA support. This application is currently being considered by the NCSE and the school will shortly be advised of the decision in relation to this application.  It should be noted, however, that SNAs are not allocated to individual pupils. The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p></reply>

Attached please find a list of the Agencies under the remit of my Department. The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the cost of each agency is available in the published annual estimates for the Department. http://per.gov.ie/estpubexp2012/; in addition annual reports and accounts of these bodies are available on their websites.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of major structural reform projects that are being progressed in the Education sector. These are 1)  Under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education Training Awards Council (FETAC) are currently being amalgamated into a new agency, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI). It is intended to establish the new Authority and dissolve the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC during the Autumn. Major savings have already been achieved through the administrative preparations for amalgamation through non-replacement of staff retiring or leaving, the consolidation of the CEO role and streamlining of operations across the existing bodies. The 2012 current allocation for the bodies was &euro;7.7 million, compared to an outturn of over &euro;13 million in 2008. Staffing in NQAI, HETAC and FETAC has reduced from 110 to 80 over the same period. Further savings will be achieved in coming years.</p><p>2) The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the HEA. The administrative costs of the Councils amounted to some &euro;1.2m in 2011. As a result of the merger it is expected that a there will be a saving of some &euro;100,000 in 2012.</p><p>3) My Department is currently engaged in implementing a government decision to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 through the merger of particular counties.  The full implementation of the decision is expected to result in annual savings to the Exchequer of the order of &euro;2.1m. These will arise from reductions in staff numbers and potential economies of scale through development of shared services. While there may be scope, over time, to dispose of surplus property it is difficult, given the state of the property market, to estimate what could be raised for the Exchequer from property sales or surrender of leases.</p><p><pcenter><b>List of Agencies</b></pcenter></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Agency name</b></th><th><b>Website address</b></th></tr><tr><td>An Chomhairle um Oideachais Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta </td><td>www.cogg.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Commission into Child Abuse</td><td>www.childabusecommission.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Education Finance Board </td><td>www.educationfinanceboard.com </td></tr><tr><td>Foras &Aacute;iseanna Saothair </td><td>www.fas.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Further Education &amp; Training Awards Council</td><td>www.fetac.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Grangegorman Development Agency </td><td>www.ggda.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Higher Education and Training Awards Council </td><td>www.hetac.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Higher Education Authority </td><td>www.hea.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Research Council </td><td>www.ircset.ie </td></tr><tr><td>L&eacute;argas - The Exchange Bureau </td><td>www.leargas.ie </td></tr><tr><td>National Centre for Guidance in Education </td><td>www.ncge.ie </td></tr><tr><td>National Council for Curriculum and Assessment </td><td>www.ncca.ie </td></tr><tr><td>National Council for Special Education </td><td>www.ncse.ie </td></tr><tr><td>National Qualifications Authority of Ireland</td><td>www.nqai.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Residential Institutions Redress Board<b></b>(RIRB) </td><td>www.rirb.ie </td></tr><tr><td>Residential Institutions Review Committee (RIRC) </td><td>See RIRB website</td></tr><tr><td>Skillnets Ltd </td><td>www.skillnets.ie </td></tr><tr><td>State Examinations Commission</td><td>www.examinations.ie </td></tr><tr><td>The Teaching Council </td><td>www.teachingcouncil.ie</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the APJ includes a target to create the environment where the number of people at work will increase by 100,000 &ndash; from 1.8 million to 1.9 million &ndash; by 2016, and reach 2 million people by 2020.  Some of the significant Department of Education and Skills actions in Budget 2012 and the APJ include -</p><p>* A new Labour Market Education and Training Fund. This &euro;20 million fund will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver upward of 6,500 places in 2012. </p><p>* Prioritisation of places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more. </p><p>* A new call under the Springboard programme for higher education courses that are aligned with areas of future skills needs and targeted at the unemployed.  In May 2012, 6,000 places on 220 courses opened for applications under Springboard 2012.</p><p>* Rollout of 750 places on 17 new fully funded graduate ICT skills conversion programmes across the country. </p><p>* A specific training initiative for managers in SMEs.</p><p>  In addition, the Action Plan contains significant actions in the whole area of  international education provision and attention to building on the Education in Ireland brand to increase awareness of Ireland as a top class centre of education services.  The Government has also prioritised investment in school buildings and earlier this year I published the first ever Five Year Plan for School Buildings. This &euro;1.5 billion investment in major school building projects will create an estimated 15,000 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs over the period of the programme (an annual average of 3,000 direct and 600 indirect jobs). </p></reply>

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 540 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.</p><p>  Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which will apply in special schools for the 2012/13 school year.  The Circular sets out that, for the 2012/13 school year, special schools will be staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled as opposed to being based principally on school designation. It is intended that staffing levels will reflect the complexity of need that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, as many Special Schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p><p>  The NCSE have advised that the school referred to by the Deputy has been allocated 5 teaching staff by the NCSE for the coming school year, along with 1 Administrative Principal post, for an enrolment of 32 pupils. This provides a pupil teacher ratio of 6.4 to 1 which is significantly in excess of the recommended staffing ratio of 1 teacher of every 8 pupils in a school for children with moderate general learning difficulties. The additional allocation takes into account the individual needs of pupils in the school and the fact that some pupils have more severe or multiple disabilities. The NCSE has confirmed that the school has an appropriate level of teaching staff to cater for all of the children enrolled in the school from September.</p></reply>

As a consequence, it has not been possible to conclude the contract with the preferred tenderer as had been originally planned. However, the expectation is that these difficulties will now be overcome later this year with the likelihood that the contract will be in place and the builder on site before the end of the calendar year.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p><p>  Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.  However, some students with autism require further support in school. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. Autism specific classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children.</p><p>  My Department supports provision in some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of over 5,000 children with autism. These figures include103 classes for autism in Co. Dublin, details of which are available on the NCSE website. The NCSE will continue to establish more classes, as required.</p></reply>

Stage 1 of the process required consortiums of institutions to submit an expression of interest to HEA within six months.  The HEA will, having considered the system level implications of the proposal, advise, within a reasonable period (no longer than a further six months), as to whether or not the proposal may proceed to the second stage of the process.

Since then, consideration has been ongoing in relation to the implementation of reform.  Reform will be introduced on a phased basis. There will be a combination of curriculum components including subjects and short courses. Within their junior cycle experience, students will learn key skills and using ICT confidently across the curriculum is incorporated in the different skills areas. The introduction of short courses will allow schools the flexibility to offer courses in a wider range of areas, including politics and I.T., should they so wish.</p><p>  Curriculum and assessment reform is well advanced in a number of senior cycle subject areas.  It is not currently proposed to expand the range of subjects offered at senior cycle.  In the current economic context, the priority is to progress and embed key reforms in Maths and the Physical Sciences.  The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a specific subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects at both junior and senior cycle.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment.  This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum.  Therefore, it is not time bound.</p></reply>

The implementation of this kind of assessment in the Junior Cycle is a considerable reform and the impact and outcomes of this will need to be considered before any changes are made in the high stakes Leaving Certificate examination. </p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.</p><p>  All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. All schools have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the coming school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie.  Where schools subsequently enrolled new pupils with special educational needs who were not considered at the time that these allocations were made, or where new medical conditions have arisen in the interim, schools may apply to the NCSE for additional SNA support.</p><p>  I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy has recently made a new application to the NCSE for additional SNA support for the child concerned. This application is currently being considered by the NCSE and the school will shortly be advised of the decision in relation to this application.   The NCSE allocates a level of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school. SNAs should then be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p></reply>

This is set out most recently in Circular Letter 31/2011.  Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed.</p><p>  Only where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher, may an unqualified or unregistered person be recruited pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher.  This provision must be inserted in the employment contract. The employer must repeat the process to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of any such contract and in any event within the school year.  An unregistered person employed pending recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher at any point after September 2010 should have no expectation of continued employment beyond the period of time that it takes the school to source a registered teacher.</p><p>  The Education (Amendment) Act 2012 was enacted on 23 May 2012.  This Act provides for a number of education-related matters, including provision to enable the implementation of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001.  Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, once commenced, will prohibit the payment of persons employed as a teacher in a recognised school from Oireachtas funds where they are not registered with the Teaching Council save for very limited, exceptional circumstances which will be set out in Ministerial Regulations. </p><p>  It is the intention of the Minister to commence section 30 during the 2012/2013 school year.  Once commenced it will be an absolute legal requirement and current provisions under Section 3.3 of Circular 31/2011 will no longer apply.  This will mean that an appropriately qualified person whose registration with the Teaching Council is pending at the time of appointment cannot not be paid from Oireachtas funds until he or she is registered.  In addition, there cannot be any retrospective payment in respect of a period for which a person was not registered.  This provision will reinforce the Department's long-standing position that education in recognised schools funded by the State must be delivered by appropriately regulated professionals.</p></reply>

An unregistered person employed pending recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher at any point after September 2010 should have no expectation of continued employment beyond the period of time that it takes the school to source a registered teacher. </p><p>  Where a registered teacher allows their registration to lapse, or an unregistered person is employed in a teaching post in a recognised school then, following commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, that person may not be paid out of monies provided by the Oireachtas beyond the very limited specific circumstances to be set down in Ministerial Regulations.  Until section 30 of the Teaching Council Act is commenced, the Department or a VEC is not prohibited from paying an unregistered person recruited in accordance with the published procedures.  It is the intention of the Minister to commence section 30 during the 2012/2013 school year.</p></reply>

While it would clearly not be feasible for my Department or the HEA to monitor or approve all individual levels of expenditure within the higher education sector, there are clear accountability and governance procedures in place within institutions, and reporting mechanisms to me, as Minster, and to the Oireachtas. In particular, under both University and IOT legislation, the President is the Accountable Officer and is answerable to the Committees of the Oireachtas in relation to the disposal of monies. The legislation also provides that the C&amp;AG undertakes annual audits of the financial statements of universities and institutes of technology which includes a review of expenditure incurred by the institutions, and the C&amp;AG reports regularly on these audits. </p><p>  Furthermore, and in line with practice in the public and private sector, Codes of Governance have been agreed at a sectorial level which provides for a range of effective measures around procedures for procurement, tendering, financial reporting, internal audit and travel. This further increases the accountability of institutions, by requiring the establishment and implementation of specific mechanisms in these areas. Each university and institute of technology is required to submit to the HEA an annual statement, confirming that all appropriate procedures and measures in relation to the above have been adhered to.  In light of the above I have no plans at present to establish a review such as that referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The features of the product are considerably more flexible and affordable than standard unsecured personal loans as the repayment schedule provides for a significant period of interest-only payments.  As the loan is variable, the student can pay off the balance of the loan early, without any fees or charges, to further reduce the overall cost of credit.  The current variable rate of 10.8% APR is below the bank's standard unsecured personal loan rates (which are 14.8% APR for loans less than &euro;5,000) and also below the standard student loan rate of 11.9% APR.

These changes affect new allowances payable to both existing teachers and to new appointees in the future.</p><p>  Under Budget 2012 teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date. Allowances for teachers first appointed between 5 December 2011 and 31 January 2012 are payable up to a maximum of &euro;4,226 which was the rate applicable to Honours Primary Degree allowance.  Pending the outcome of the review of allowances and premium payments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries from 1 February 2012. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, subject to certain restrictions, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.  The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses, including the individual referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of the review.   The Department is not in a position to comment further on the position in relation to teacher allowances until the outcome of the public service-wide review of allowances is known.</p></reply>

Accordingly, whereas I provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor the Department have legal powers to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regards to individual complaint cases, or to investigate individual complaints except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.  In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively, to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils in its care and, as employer, the Board also has responsibilities in relation to the action of its employees. Matters relating to the management of schools are dealt with at local level.</p><p>  In dealing with parental complaints, my Department's role is to clarify for parents how their grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed. If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. Where a parent feels that the school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child. The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1, (Ph) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail oco@oco.ie.</p></reply>

Under the panel arrangements, the most junior eligible permanent teacher in a school with surplus teaching staff is placed on the panel for redeployment to another school.</p><p>  Responsibility for running schools on a day-to-day basis is devolved from the patron to the board of management and this was statutorily underpinned by Section 14 of the Education Act 1998. Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers are the responsibility of boards of management.  Under Circulars 59/2009 (VEC schools) and 60/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence. This agreement was made under the terms of Towards 2016 and the procedures were issued in September 2009.  The procedures serve a dual purpose in that they provide a framework which enables schools to maintain satisfactory standards, and for teachers and principals to have access to procedures whereby alleged failures to comply with these standards may be fairly and sensitively addressed.</p><p>  Matters of professional competence are dealt with through a process which allows for informal counselling and the use of internal and external supports such as the Employee Assistance Service and relevant educational support services. Only when the informal procedures are unsuccessful in addressing professional competence issues are the formal stages invoked which may at the end of the process have recourse to disciplinary action (up to and including dismissal).  Matters of conduct follow a similarly staged procedure. However, in the cases of serious misconduct at work or a threat to health and safety to children or other personnel in the school the stages outlined above do not normally apply and a teacher may be dismissed without recourse to the previous stages. A teacher may also be placed on administrative leave on full pay pending an investigation and the conclusion of any appeal process.</p></reply>

These changes affect new allowances payable to both existing teachers and to new appointees in the future.  Under Budget 2012 teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date. Allowances for teachers first appointed between 5 December 2011 and 31 January 2012 are payable up to a maximum of &euro;4,226 which was the rate applicable to Honours Primary Degree allowance.

The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, subject to certain restrictions, the assistant principal allowance. These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.

The playing fields are currently licensed to schools of the Trust.  I have requested the congregation to consider transferring the beneficial ownership of the playing fields and associated lands directly to the State, which would continue to licence the playing fields to the schools concerned.

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p><p>  I have asked the HEA to submit a detailed report, before the end of the year, on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.  It is far too early at present to set out precise timelines or plans for individual colleges.  I will consider the implementation plan from the HEA and will then report back to Cabinet, probably in the new year, with more formal proposals including financial implications.</p></reply>

However, as the Teaching Council is the registered organisation that liaises with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for the vetting of teachers, an indication of the level of vetting that has been carried out for teachers is that, as of July 2012, approximately 31,000 of circa 73,000 teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council have been vetted.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that in July this year the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012.

In mid-2011, I launched the National Strategy to improve Literacy and Numeracy among children and young people 2011 to 2020.   One of the early actions implemented under the Strategy was to ask all primary schools to increase the time spent on mathematics by 70 minutes per week from January 2012.  At post-primary, in September 2011, post primary schools were asked to make every effort to ensure that students have access to a mathematics lesson every day, particularly in junior cycle, from the earliest possible date; that mathematics be strengthened in Transition Year, where available; and that every effort should be made, insofar as is possible, to deploy teachers who hold a qualification in mathematics to mathematics teaching. </p><p>  In relation to science, the primary curriculum emphasises that all aspects of the child's development are interrelated and the developmental process is interactive and complex.  Science is addressed not just through science but also through other curricular-related areas, for example, geography and mathematics.  At post-primary level, I am currently considering detailed implementation arrangements for a revised Junior Cycle. Science will continue to play an important role in the new Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

The main priority under this scheme is the equipping of each classroom with a teaching computer and digital projector. Once the baseline is in place schools can allocate any remaining funding under the scheme to other ICT equipment and software for educational use. </p><p>  A number of key support measures were taken to help schools get best value in the use of these devolved grants - in particular, the inclusion of schools in national purchasing frameworks for desktops, laptops, digital projectors and printers, the delivery of a national series of e-learning seminars for school leaders, and the provision of extensive guidance and training on the use of ICT in the classroom. </p><p>  I am aware that there is a significant deployment of interactive whiteboards across primary schools. However, I do not have precise information on the numbers of IWBs deployed per school or per classroom. In practice, expenditure decisions at this level are matters for the Boards of Management of the schools concerned subject to compliance with conditions of grant funding, and are not subject to central national statistical reporting. </p><p>  That said, I am keen to assess the impact of the funding distributed, and in that context it is planned to carry out a comprehensive survey of ICT integration in schools later this year. I would like to assure the Deputy that this survey will include questions covering interactive whiteboard deployment and I look forward to sharing the results with all stakeholders in due course.</p></reply>

ICT, including digital literacy, is an integral part of a student's on-going education. It harnesses the young person's natural sense of wonder. The primary curriculum promotes the importance of ICT as a resource which enriches the quality of teaching and learning across the curriculum.</p><p>  In fact, the recently published National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011) in setting out what our young people should achieve in primary and post-primary highlights the need to improve outcomes through &quot;increasing awareness of the importance of digital literacy and including assessment of students' (at both levels) ability to read digital material as part of the national assessments of English reading&quot;.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle, proposed for introduction in schools in 2014, features literacy and numeracy and six other key skills that will be embedded in all junior cycle subjects and short courses. The descriptors of the six skills include specific elements and each has the use of ICT highlighted.</p><p>  The new Junior Cycle Framework also provides for short courses to be introduced in schools, some of which will be developed by the NCCA and some by schools themselves. A short course that the NCCA is currently working on is in the area of Digital Literacy which includes topics such as information literacy, personal safety online, digital storytelling, and online privacy. </p><p>  The Senior Cycle curriculum explicitly espouses the central role of self-directed learning, a spirit of enquiry, critical thinking and problem solving. Recently revised syllabi contain references to the student as a researcher. This requires the skills of analysis of a range of data to make judgements based on the student's research. Such an approach is, in reality, at the heart of good practice in quality teaching and learning.</p></reply>

The establishment of QQAAI will result in savings to the Exchequer.</p><p>2) The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the HEA. The administrative costs of the Councils amounted to some &euro;1.2m in 2011. As a result of the merger it is expected that a there will be a saving of some &euro;100,000 in 2012.</p><p>3) My Department is currently engaged in implementing a government decision to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 through the merger of particular counties.  The full implementation of the decision is expected to result in annual savings to the Exchequer of the order of &euro;2.1m. These will arise from reductions in staff numbers and potential economies of scale through development of shared services. While there may be scope, over time, to dispose of surplus property it is difficult, given the state of the property market, to estimate what could be raised for the Exchequer from property sales or surrender of leases.</p></reply>

Remuneration is defined at section 1 of the Act as emoluments to which Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies or is applied and payable by or on behalf of a public service body to a public servant for his or her services as a public servant. This definition includes non-pensionable pay, including overtime, acting-up allowances and benefit-in-kind.  The PRD is not a pension contribution and does not confer pension entitlements.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Act was introduced in the context of the need to give priority to the stabilization of the public finances and to reflect the substantial benefits generally available to staff under public service pension terms.

Current public servants who are obliged to retire at age 65 in 2021 will be able to draw their public service occupational pension at age 65.  </p><p>  For public servants on modified PRSI, the change in State Pension age will have no effect on their pensions.  But a fully insured public servant (i.e. paying full PRSI) has a pension which, like many other occupational pension schemes, is co-ordinated with social welfare benefits.  The public service pension paid is therefore integrated with the pensioner&rsquo;s social welfare benefits, which have been contributed to over the pensioner&rsquo;s working life by the employer as well as the pensioner.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension (Contributory). </p><p>  Where this does not happen a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public service pension scheme to bridge the gap.  One of the conditions for payment of a supplementary pension is that the pensioner, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for Social Welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available Social Welfare benefits (and not only the State Pension (Contributory)) in order to receive a supplementary pension.</p></reply>

The changed economic environment has meant that it is necessary to do "better for less", providing real value-for-money for the Irish taxpayer by maximising efficiency and eliminating waste. It is estimated that &euro;9 billion is spent by public bodies annually on the public procurement of supplies and services. This is a very significant portion of overall spending and it is essential that the Public Service is achieving maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. It is for this reason that public procurement is one of the major pillars of key strategic importance under the Government's Public Service Reform Plan, published in November 2011.</p><p>The reform plan includes specific measures to ensure that: </p><p>1. aggregated procurement arrangements are utilised across the public service;</p><p>2. public bodies have appropriately trained staff to implement reform and to ensure the State is getting value for money; and</p><p>3. greater emphasis will be placed on analysing what the State purchases in order to assess other savings that can be made through more efficient procurement methods.</p><p>  In order to ensure that the necessary elements are in place to implement these ambitious reforms, my Department engaged Accenture to undertake a capacity and capability review of the central procurement function to identify the actions required to realise substantial savings in public procurement in the short and medium term. The final report on this review is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  Following the review, proposals were recently submitted to Government. These proposals represent a new consolidated and integrated approach to public procurement that includes: integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office through the establishment of a National Procurement Office (under the aegis of my Department) which will be headed by a Chief Procurement Officer; strengthening spend analytics and data management; examining the specifications set out for goods and services; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and strengthening vendor and category management. </p><p>  These proposals have now been agreed by Government.</p><p>  These reforms will lead to reductions in the cost of goods and services; better procurement services at lower cost; introduction of technical standardisation; greater attention to contract management and better problem resolution; greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.</p></reply>

The supplier in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing. Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector. </p><p>  The majority of public sector bodies currently have ad-hoc print arrangements in place. A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices such as; photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements. The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  </p><p>  The MPS Framework offers all public sector bodies in the State access to a print solution that is strategic and cost efficient that can be tailored to the specific needs of their individual organisation. Following an open competition, advertised on e-tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), the Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012. The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years. The minimum turnover requirement for entry into the Framework was an average of  &euro;10 million per annum for the three most recent years of audited accounts or where the date of establishment is more recent for each year the entity has been established.</p><p>  The value of the Framework Agreement over two years was estimated to be &euro;100 million. Taking into account the value of the Framework and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print devices up front, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.  </p><p>  Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). One of the tenderers did not have the required turnover in their own right to qualify for the Framework and formed an alliance with a large manufacturer to satisfy the turnover requirement.   Furthermore, the Framework Members have indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS.  The Framework for MPS stipulates that public sector bodies carry out mini-competitions between the Framework Members for MPS solutions. To date six mini-competitions have been completed and all six have been won by Framework Members who are indigenous SMEs.</p><p>  Circular 6/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution. If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework. It is a matter for each public sector body to determine which route offers the best value for their organisation.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce amendments to the legislation which underpins the rateable valuation system on which commercial rates are collected. The proposed amendments to the Valuation Act 2001 are designed to accelerate the valuation process and to streamline the appeal procedures available to ratepayers.  As part of the efforts to accelerate the revaluation process the legislation will also provide the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment by ratepayers and also for the external delivery of elements of the valuation process.</p><p><br />  The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers' rates liabilities.  Information in relation to the revaluation process is published on the Valuation Office website <i>www.valoff.ie</i></p></reply>

The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates.  The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities.  It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in values and rents following the economic downturn of recent years.  The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values.  Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability.  Revaluation of the Valuation List is not meant to reduce the amount of rates revenue collected.  On average, businesses do not benefit from a revaluation although some ratepayers may benefit if relative valuations of different types of commercial property change.  Overall, revaluation results in a fairer distribution of the rates burden.</p><p>  The revaluation programme, which has been completed in three county council areas in Dublin, began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, the revaluation of Fingal was completed in 2009 and the revaluation of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council area began in May 2011 and will be completed in 2013.  The Commissioner signed valuation orders for Waterford on 12 December 2011 and Limerick on 29 March 2012.  The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  It is intended to extend the revaluation programme to further local authority areas as soon as it is practicable to do so but it is not possible at present to say where these areas will be.  While the extension of the project to Dublin City is the major current focus and represents an important advance, the Commissioner has expressed his concern that the present rate of progress may not allow the Office to complete the job nationally within the ten years from 2008 which the Office previously indicated.  With the intention of speeding up the revaluation programme, the Commissioner has indicated that two pilot schemes were to be undertaken on outsourcing some of the work and exploring the possibility of introducing a self-assessment scheme.  The enabling provisions to allow for the start-up of these schemes are included in the Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012 which was published on 3 August 2012 as part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s policy is supported by the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service and the sharing of advice and information through the Civil Service Disability Liaison Officers Network.  Recruitment competitions run by the Public Appointments Service are open to all, including people with disabilities, subject to them meeting the eligibility requirements of the competition in question.  Application forms invite applicants to indicate if they have special requirements when undergoing the selection process and the Public Appointments Service makes every effort to facilitate these requirements.  A survey of staff carried out in 2011 to compile data on staff with disabilities, indicated that 6.5% of staff (from a staffing complement of 309) in the Department had a disability.</p></reply>

The stimulus package is additional to the investment outlined in the Exchequer Capital Framework, which was published last November, and will be largely predicated on using non-Exchequer sources of funding to support the first phase of a new PPP Programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure.  As the Deputy is aware, public capital infrastructure projects are procured either as Exchequer-funded projects or as Public Private Partnerships.  PPPs are arrangements between the public and private sectors (consistent with a broad range of possible partnership structures) with clear agreement on shared objectives for the delivery of public infrastructure and/or public services by the private sector that would otherwise have been provided through traditional public sector procurement.  The procurement of infrastructure projects via PPP involves a tendering process whereby consortia are invited to bid, in most instances, to Design, Build, Finance, Maintain and Operate a particular piece of public infrastructure.  The consortium must be in a position to secure private debt financing and private equity to support its bid.  The consortium is subject to an extensive financial due diligence process by the private funding providers prior to loan approval.</p><p>  The National Development Finance Agency, which is the State's centre of expertise for PPPs, is responsible for the procurement of all PPPs except those in the transport sector.  The National Roads Authority is responsible for roads procurement and the Railway Procurement Agency is responsible for rail PPPs. Tender competitions for the new PPP programme will continue to be conducted in line with national and EU public procurement procedures.  It is important to note that Article 45 of Council Directive 2004/18/EC (as implemented in Ireland by Regulation 53 of the Procurement Regulations) provides for situations where a person can be excluded from participation in a public contract.  Specifically, a public authority may exclude from consideration a person who: is subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency procedure or process; has been found guilty of professional misconduct; has breached tax or social security laws and regulations; or has provided misleading information to the authority.  My Department sets the overall procurement policy for public bodies; however, it is a matter for each sponsoring authority, in conjunction with the procuring authority, to set, within the confines of that policy, the eligibility conditions of each tender process.</p></reply>

My Department has been informed by the Office of the Information Commissioner that at the end of August 2012, there were 209 applications for review awaiting decision in the Office, including 16 applications which were received in 2009 and which require the consideration of complex issues and/or large volumes of records.  The Deputy may wish to note that as set out in the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2011 published in May 2012, 57% of cases closed last year were over one year old reflecting specific initiatives aimed at closing older cases.  In addition, the length of time taken to deal with each application depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the issues involved and the volume of records at issue.  I am advised that the Information Commissioner is very conscious of the statutory requirement that reviews are completed, in so far as practicable, within four months of receipt.  With this in mind, the Information Commissioner has recently arranged for resources to be reassigned within her office to reduce the number of cases on hand.  An examination of current structures and processes is also actively under way to optimise the number of reviews completed within four months.  The Information Commissioner stated in her Annual Report that her Office will continue to endeavour to close cases within four months while also concentrating on older cases.

Its strategy for the South East Region, of which Waterford is the Gateway, is to:  market the Region to overseas clients in order to secure new investments; support the growth and development of the Region&#8217;s existing client base by working with them to transform their business in the Region in order to create additional employment and sustainability; and to Ensure that the supporting infrastructure is in place to attract FDI.</p><p><br />  To date in 2012, there has been a significant increase of IDA site visits, 21 in total, to the South East Region, illustrating IDA&#8217;s focus on the Region. By early this year, there were 62 IDA supported client companies in the South East Region, employing c.11,600 people and the Agency is actively engaged with all its existing base of companies in the region, highlighting the on-going importance of up-skilling and re-skilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure their on-going development and sustainability for the long term. </p><p><br />  A recent significant investment announcement in the South East Region was the official opening in February 2012 of the first phase of the &#8364;23 million Belview Strategic Water Supply Scheme, which will facilitate industrial development and job creation in Kilkenny and the South East. The total investment for this phase of the scheme is &#8364;13m of which a significant amount was provided by IDA Ireland and the balance by Kilkenny County Council and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p><br />  In accordance with the South East Employment Action Plan, which I initiated following the closure of the <i>Talk Talk</i>   Call Centre, all the key State players are actively pursuing initiatives to facilitate development and job creation in the region.  I travelled to Waterford in June last to meet the members of the South-East Forum and I was heartened to hear of the progress being made.   In addition to the work of the IDA, as listed above, I was pleased to hear of many developments which had been achieved since the publication of the Action Plan.  </p><p><br />  Foremost amongst these has been that Enterprise Ireland has supported the establishment of the <i>Eishtec</i>   Call Centre in Waterford city, where employment had reached 230.  This is a very significant achievement and other recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland in the region included the approval of 14 high quality projects under their competitive feasibility fund, 12 companies being been approved for Graduate Placement. 5 Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for full-time business development managers and a high take-up of the EI Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.</p><p><br />  The enterprise development agencies will adopt a &#8216;<i>Spotlight on Waterford and the South East Region</i>  &#8217; to the end of 2012.  Other bodies had also made considerable progress, with FAS training services having provided training for about 5,000 people and that Agency also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.  Several tourist initiatives are underway in the region and Science Foundation Ireland have funded 8 research awards to Waterford Institute of Technology.  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created 59 new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.</p><p><br />  I fully appreciate that much needs to be done to tackle unemployment in the Waterford region. On a national basis, the Action Plan for Jobs, introduced earlier this year, sets out a series of clear actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs. The objective of the Action Plan is to create the environment where 100,000 net new jobs can be created by 2016 and to have 2 million people at work by 2010. </p></reply>

That Report concluded that, because of high costs and limited industrial development returns, membership should not be considered a priority.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources available to the Government has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country &ndash; most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.  Ireland's membership of international research organisations is reviewed on a regular basis and in the case of the European Space Agency, for example, the value of membership in terms of support to Irish companies and researchers is considered to justify the costs of our membership.</p><p>  It is important to note, however, that Irish researchers are not precluded from participating in, and benefiting from, the work being done at CERN.  In an ideal world, of course it would be desirable to be involved in this major project, based in Europe as it is.  The question is whether we should divert very scarce, and in most cases committed, funding away from the areas that we had identified as having the best chance of contributing to our economic recovery.  </p><p>  The costs of full membership of CERN are understood to be over &euro;10m per annum.  While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved, as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  Should budgetary circumstances change; the matter could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost/benefit viewpoint. </p></reply>

In addition, new employment permit applications are normally only considered where it is established that a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 per annum is on offer based on a 39 hour week and where the position on offer is one of the occupations currently eligible for a new employment permit. </p><p>  It appeared from the information submitted with the application that the proposed employee's current immigration status, which had not altered since he entered the State, precluded him from entering full-time employment in the State. Finally, supporting information sought in respect of the application itself was not provided within the specified time frame. This decision was upheld on appeal on 19 July 2012.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that Non-EEA nationals who are granted residence in Ireland under the 2004 Student Probationary Extension, established by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, are entitled to work in Ireland under the conditions that would normally pertain to the academic holidays, i.e. a person may work for up to 40 hours per week.  These arrangements allow eligible students to reside in Ireland for a period of 2 years on specified conditions.  In addition, at the conclusion of the two year probationary period those students will be eligible to apply for a more permanent status on condition that certain obligations have been fulfilled.  It is understood that the person named by the Deputy will shortly renew his immigration status. He may wish to be considered for eligibility under this facility at that point.</p></reply>

It was established to implement the "Ideas Programme" of the Seventh European Union Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7).  Its main aim is to stimulate scientific excellence by supporting and encouraging the very best, truly creative scientists, scholars and engineers to be adventurous and take risks in their research.  Being 'investigator-driven', or 'bottom-up', in nature, the ERC approach allows researchers to identify new opportunities and directions in any field of research. </p><p>  To date Irish researchers have won ERC awards totalling &euro;34m. While this is not insignificant, there is certainly scope for improvement and I am confident that we will see more success in ERC grants by the end of FP7.  To get a better appreciation of Irish researchers&rsquo; performance in securing EU funding one has to look at the success rate across FP7 as a whole.  Funding from the ERC is only one part (14.87%) of the overall FP7 budget of &euro;50bn over the period 2007 -2013.  Since the commencement of FP7 in January 2007 to June 2012, Irish researchers have won awards under the Programme totalling &euro;438m, representing a success rate of 21.78%.  This is above the EU average success rate of 20.72%.  This shows that overall Ireland continues to perform very creditably vis a vis other EU Member States and that we remain on track to secure our target of &euro;600m from FP7.</p></reply>

There is no provision in the Act, or elsewhere in Irish employment law, for a statutory entitlement to part-time work. Rather, the Act makes provision for the Labour Relations Commission to carry out studies for the purposes of identifying obstacles that may exist in particular industries or sectors to access to part-time work, and for the Commission, in consultation with the social partners, to prepare a Code of Practice which would be of practical benefit to employers and employees in addressing such obstacles.</p><p>  In this context, the Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working (Statutory Instrument Number 8 of 2006) aims to encourage employers and employees to consider part-time work and provides guidance on procedures to improve access to part-time work for those employees who wish to work on a part-time basis. </p><p>  Best practice recommends that employers assess within their own organisations the possibilities of either introducing part-time working or increasing the range/scope of existing part-time working arrangements. The Code recommends that employers should explore, in consultation with their employees and representatives, as appropriate, the possibility of introducing part-time work opportunities and/or maximise the range of posts as suitable for part-time working at all levels in the organisation.</p><p>  A key element in the consideration of improving access to part-time work - either introducing part-time working arrangements or enhancing existing arrangements - is the operational/business context of the organisation and the need to enhance economic competitiveness.

The Bodies that are involved in the rationalisation programme are listed in full in Table 1, as well as the staff and financial savings anticipated.  I would like in particular, to point to significant reforms underway in a number of the Bodies listed on which work is being progressed.  This includes reforms such as the merging of the Competition Authority with the National Consumer Agency; a major programme of reform in relation to the rationalisation of the employment rights Bodies to reduce these in number from 5 to 2; Government agreement to dissolve the existing County Enterprise Boards and create a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; micro enterprise support structure; the integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department in order to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy and, the intention, announced by Government to bring forward proposals before year end 2012 for the implementation of the decision on restructuring State Airports and Shannon Development and the re-alignment of tourism and enterprise support functions in the Shannon region.</p><p><b>Table 1:</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Name of Body/ Organisation</th><th>Current Status</th><th>Savings/Reduction in numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Competition Authority and <br />National Consumer Agency</td><td>The Government has agreed to merge these two bodies. As both agencies were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.  Government approved the draft Heads of a Bill in July 2011 and these were sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  </td><td>Initial set-up costs will be incurred.<br /><br />No savings in whole-time<br />equivalent (WTE) numbers. </td></tr><tr><td>Labour Court<br /><br />National Employment Rights Authority<br /><br />Labour Relations Commission<br /><br />Employment Appeals Tribunal<br /><br />Equality Tribunal</td><td>A major reform programme is underway to replace the five existing employments rights bodies with two. Four of the existing bodies &#8211; the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court &#8211; are currently within the remit of the Department. One &#8211; the Equality Tribunal &#8211; is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br /><br />In terms of delivering the reform a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered, including the development of a:<br /><br />- Single Contact Portal<br />A new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; is fully operational since the beginning of 2012 and provides a single point of entry into the system for employment rights and industrial relations information. <br /><br />- Single Complaint Form<br />A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints was launched on the 4th of January 2012 replacing 30 forms previously in use.  <br /><br />- Workplace Relations Website<br />The new interim workplace relations website  went live on 4th January 2012.  This website brings together, in one place, information on all aspects of employment rights and industrial relations. <br /><br />- Early Resolution Service<br />Delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.  <br /><br />Consultation <br />The Minister has undertaken two public consultation processes and published two policy papers setting out in detail how the reform will be delivered.  He engaged with the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in July 2012. <br /><br />Legislation<br />A draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will put the reforms on a statutory footing, has been prepared and the Cabinet approved the priority drafting of the Bill in July 2012.</td><td>The annual cost of the Workplace Relations Services amounted to some &#8364;20m in 2010. It is expected that significant savings, in terms of both reductions in staff numbers &amp; increased efficiency &amp; productivity, will be generated by the end of 2013 by which time the majority of the Workplace Relations Reform Programme will have been implemented. Work has commenced on identifying and capturing on-going pay and non-pay savings.</td></tr><tr><td>County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs)</td><td>Government has approved the establishment of a new &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; micro-enterprise support structure through the dissolution of the existing CEBs and the formation of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). An implementation Working Group composed of representatives of the Government Departments and State Agencies involved in developing and rolling out the new model is working under the auspices of the Department to progress the matter.<br /><br />In conjunction with this, the Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding appropriate legislation.</td><td>It is to be expected that over time there will be savings resulting from the removal of costs associated with the individual Company status of each CEB, use of shared services, reduced rental costs associated with the relocation of some offices etc. However initial direct savings will be modest as it could take some years to realise these savings due to existing leasing arrangements etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Forf&aacute;s</td><td>Last July I announced my intention to integrate Forfas into my Department to strengthen the Department&#8217;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. This includes the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ACSTI) which comes under the aegis of Forf&aacute;s. An Implementation Group, comprising senior management from my Department, Forf&aacute;s, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is overseeing the integration project and will consider all of the legislative, financial and staffing implications that arise from the exercise. A project of this nature would typically take up to 18 months for completion. </td><td>Integration will improve efficiencies/ synergies between the Department and Forf&aacute;s, but will not lead to immediate financial savings.  Potential initial costs of integration (e.g. ensuring compatibility of IT systems) need to be explored by the Implementation Group.<br /><br />Integration of Forf&aacute;s with DJEI will facilitate improvements in the use of existing resources &#8211; the objective is not driven by achieving reductions in WTEs.  In any event, the scope for further reduction is severely limited following departure of staff of retirement age in February. </td></tr><tr><td>Shannon Development</td><td>The Steering Group and Task Forces which were established following the Government Decisions of the 8th and 29th May have met throughout the summer and have dealt with a large number of issues which will be relevant in setting up the new entity under public ownership. The Steering Group is also addressing issues relating to the re-alignment of tourism functions in the region and enterprise functions in the Free Zone which are currently being carried out by Shannon Development.  The Steering Group will report back to Cabinet by year end. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Companies Registration Office and the <br />Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies</td><td>The McCarthy Report suggested that a formal merger of the CRO and RFS would secure additional efficiencies. However, the offices have been &#8216;de facto&#8217; merged for the past nine years, with the officer designated as the Registrar of Companies also designated as the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and the budget for both offices is a common one.</td><td>No savings arise.</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Science and Engineering (DSE) Programme</td><td>As part of the Government&#8217;s rationalisation process, the DSE programme with 5 staff transferred from Forf&aacute;s to Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) with effect from 1st March 2012. There are a lot of synergies and mutual complementarities between DSE and a number of SFI funded activities that support science awareness efforts. The DSE brand is being maintained to be at the forefront of SFI&#8217;s science, technology, engineering and mathematics awareness (STEM) activities.</td><td>Work is currently underway in SFI to examine how a range of efficiencies can be delivered. This principally involves an international panel review process which is examining how SFI, through DSE and wider STEM awareness/communications activities can contribute further to the strengthening of capacity for future economic growth.<br />It is too early to quantify precisely the annual cost savings and efficiencies arising as a result of the transfer of DSE to SFI. This will become more apparent after the international panel review completes its work and presents its recommendations in late 2012.  </td></tr></table></p><p>The annual cost for each Agency in 2012 is set out in the Revised Estimates Volume, which can be found on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at: <i>http://per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Rev-20121.pdf</i>  .</p><p>The information in respect of new committees and groups of the type outlined by the Deputy that have been set up since I assumed office is set out in Table 2 below.

Supporting the maintenance of existing jobs is also an important objective of the Government.  The Jobs Initiative, which was announced in May 2011, was aimed at rebuilding confidence in the economy, providing opportunities for the re-skilling of those who had lost their jobs, and assisting people to get back to work.  It was a whole-of-Government initiative, for delivery across a range of Departments.  While it is not possible to indicate the exact number of positions which have been filled as a result of the measures introduced under the Jobs Initiative, there is no doubt that they are contributing to both maintaining existing jobs and creating new ones.  </p><p><br />  The Jobs Initiative introduced a reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% from 1 July 2011 on a range of labour-intensive services, with a particular focus on the hospitality sector. The Government also halved employers&#8217; PRSI in respect of those earning up to &#8364;356 per annum.  These measures helped to support an annual increase in employment of 8,700 people in the Accommodation and Food Services sector in the first quarter of 2102, as reported in the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 7 June.  The Government has also introduced a visa-waiver scheme, which was announced in the Jobs Initiative, to further support the tourism sector.  The number of overseas visitors to Ireland increased by 7% in 2011, the first increase since 2007.  </p><p><br />  The Jobs Initiative targeted &#8364;135 million Capital spending at labour-intensive local projects, focussing on school works, local roads, energy efficiency and smarter travel projects.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>  The level of take-up and activity under the domestic energy retrofitting schemes to date is demonstrably supporting employment.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has reported that over 5,800 full time jobs were supported in 2011 through the Better Energy retrofitting scheme.  This represented an increase of some 2,000 jobs being supported under the scheme.</p><p><br />  The JobBridge National Internship Programme was announced in the Jobs Initiative and was launched on 1 July 2011.  To date, over 10,000 people have participated on JobBridge.  Initial feedback received by the Department of Social Protection indicates that approximately 40% of participants have been offered a position on or before completion of their internship.  This figure is expected to increase as more detailed data is collected. </p><p><br />  From my own Department&#8217;s perspective, the Jobs Initiative announced proposals for the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, a Microfinance Fund for small business start-ups, the extension of the 15 day prompt payment arrangements to the wider public sector, improvements to the R&amp;D tax credit scheme, the introduction of a diaspora &#8220;job finders&#8221; scheme and improvements in access to procurement for SMEs.  All of these measures, and many more, have been now implemented under the Action Plan for Jobs which followed on from the Jobs Initiative.  These measures, which have been introduced in recent months, will have a sustainable impact on employment.   </p></reply>

However, the Government has a key role to play in providing the environment where businesses can start-up, expand and create sustainable jobs.  </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs, which was published on 13 February last, sets out a series of clear, actionable measures to support the creation and retention of jobs by improving supports for business and removing barriers to employment-creation.  The Plan contains over 270 actions to be implemented across all Government Departments, as well as 36 State agencies. </p><p>  The Action Plan has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  </p><p>  Although it is only seven months since the Action Plan was published, some very significant objectives have already been achieved across Government.  From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective, I have introduced legislation underpinning the Microfinance Fund and the Partial Credit Guarantee scheme.  I have launched a new Development Capital Fund aimed at addressing funding gaps for mid-sized high-growth companies.  I have announced a second global call under Innovation Fund Ireland, encouraging top venture capitalists to signal their interest in establishing a presence in Ireland.  </p><p>  Amongst the many actions delivered by Enterprise Ireland to date are the establishment of a new Potential Exporters Division to help more Irish companies to trade in foreign markets.  Enterprise Ireland have also launched a Women in Business Initiative and rolled out a new &euro;2 million Clustering programme.  IDA Ireland has launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme, aimed at generating 5,000 jobs in the next five years, and has continued to work hard to attract new investments. </p><p>  It is not possible to indicate the exact number of positions which have been filled as a result of the measures put in place to date from the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is also important to remember that the Action Plan is designed to support existing jobs, as well as encouraging new employment.  What is clear, however, is that the Action Plan is beginning to show tangible results.  Figures published last week by the CSO indicate that our exports for July 2012, at almost &euro;8 billion, showed a 13% increase over July 2011, and a 6% increase on the June 2012 figure.  IDA Ireland has also announced the creation of over 3,000 jobs since the start of the year, right across the country.  Employment in the tourism sector increased by 8,700 in the period March 2011 to March 2012.  The employment created through these developments will also support other jobs in the supply chain.  </p><p>  I am confident that through the continued implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs across Government, we will accelerate the transition to economic recovery and provide a strong foundation for sustainable jobs.</p></reply>

In these circumstances, taxi costs are included with other forms of transport costs (e.g. mileage and public transport) on my Department's financial management system and it is not feasible to identify such taxi costs separately for the period in question.  My Department recognises that the use of public transport is normally the most economical means of transport available and should be availed of by staff wherever possible. As a general rule, the use of taxis &ndash; either in Ireland or abroad &ndash; should arise only where no suitable public transport is available, or where the use of public transport is not feasible.</p><p>Whether a taxi is being charged to the account or being reimbursed on foot of a receipt, staff are regularly asked to explain the reason why a taxi was required or are asked for an explanation in regard to the cost. My Department is housed in six separate offices in Dublin city and taxis are used by staff to move IT equipment, lodge cash in the bank or to move boxes, crates and in some cases small items of furniture. Staff may also use taxis where there is a perceived risk to personal safety (e.g. when arriving/departing at unsociable hours), or where there is a likelihood of missing a flight or where it is not practical to use public transport due, for example, to the location of the hotel or meeting room.</p></reply>

There has been no change to this figure since the Budget.  In Budget 2012, the CEBs received an Exchequer Capital Allocation of &euro;15 million towards the provision of grants and soft supports to the micro-enterprise sector.  Individual CEB Capital Allocations were then made by the CEB Central Coordination Unit (CCU) based within Enterprise Ireland early in the first quarter of 2012 in line with established allocation criteria.</p><p>In determining the allocations to individual CEBs a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.</p><p>As in previous years, should additional funding be required and become available from savings elsewhere in the Department, full consideration will be given to making extra Capital funding available to the CEBs during the course of the year.

Table 2 below sets out the number of researchers supported by Science Foundation Ireland over the period 2004 &ndash; 2011 inclusive.</p><p>Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s capital grant budget for 2012 is &euro;156m, which will enable the Foundation to retain support for the current levels of approximately 3,000 researchers and 28 research centres. Table 3 below sets out Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s 2012 budget.  For 2012 the pay and administrative programme costs associated with running its various programmes include provision in respect of the Discover Science and Engineering programme, for which responsibility transferred from Forfas to Science Foundation Ireland in March 2012.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to accelerating the commercialisation of research and exploitation of new technologies. Clearly given Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal difficulties, there is a great imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country &ndash; most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.</p><p>Since the 2012 Budget there have been many policy actions completed which will impact across Ireland&rsquo;s research ecosystem. These actions include the National Research Prioritisation exercise, the ASCTI report on Sustainability of Research Centres, and the streamlining of national IP arrangements amongst other things.</p><p>Given Ireland&rsquo;s current fiscal circumstances there is a need to accelerate the delivery of economic and societal benefits from our investment in research by prioritising resources in areas of opportunity, building closer collaboration between the research base and enterprise and making it easier to commercialise and use new knowledge.  However, we recognise that we cannot sustain this without maintaining the world class research base that we have built over the past decade.</p><p>Therefore consistent with Government policy, as detailed in the above reports and aligned to the Programme for Government, SFI is now seeking to build upon the groundwork already put in place by continuing to invest in excellent research and by engendering greater impact from its funded research for the benefit of Ireland. In this context, legislation is in preparation to enable SFI to fund applied research in addition to its existing remit to fund oriented basic research. Subject to debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the coming months, this legislation should be enacted by the end of 2012 or in early 2013.</p><p>Whilst there has been some reduction in capital funding to the SFI since the 2009 the Foundation has been able to sustain its direct support to a cohort of 3,000 researchers. The policy intention is that SFI can continue to provide this level of support in the years ahead but it shall be dependent on multiple variables, not just funding provision but also critically on the quality and strategic relevance for enterprise of the research applications being submitted. It shall also be dependent on wider factors such as what our international competitors are doing. In essence though, the principal conditions for qualifying for SFI grant funding remain unchanged, namely scientific excellence, as determined by rigorous international peer-review, and alignment with the strategic needs of Irish industry.</p><p><pcenter><b>Appendix 1 &ndash; Tables</b></pcenter></p><p><b>Table 1</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year </b></th><th><b>Capital/ Research grants ( &#8364; )</b></th><th><b>Current expenditure - </b><br /><b>Pay ( &#8364; )</b></th><th><b>Administrative costs of running grant programmes ( &#8364; )</b></th><th><b>Other (&#8364;)</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2004</b></td><td>108.59m</td><td>1.32m</td><td>3.82m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2005</b></td><td>118.20m</td><td>2.74m</td><td>4.62m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2006</b></td><td>139.86m</td><td>3.21m</td><td>4.49m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2007</b></td><td>155.72m</td><td>3.56m</td><td>4.77m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2008</b></td><td>158.81m</td><td>4.37m</td><td>5.01m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2009</b></td><td>171.17m</td><td>4.67m </td><td>4.54m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td>150.00m</td><td>4.32m</td><td>3.92m</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><b>2011 </b></td><td>153.80m </td><td>4.29m </td><td>3.56m </td><td>5m*</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>2004</b></th><th><b>2005</b></th><th><b>2006</b></th><th><b>2007</b></th><th><b>2008</b></th><th><b>2009</b></th><th><b>2010</b></th><th><b>2011</b></th></tr><tr><td>No. of Researchers</td><td>1,067</td><td>1,610</td><td>1,362</td><td>1,909</td><td>2,812</td><td>3,225</td><td>2,999</td><td>2,995 </td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Capital Research Grants (&#8364;)</b></th><th><b>Current Expenditure - Pay </b></th><th><b>Administrative costs of running grant programmes </b></th><th><b>Other / E-Journals</b></th></tr><tr><td>156.00m</td><td>4.43m</td><td>4.236m </td><td>5.00m </td></tr></table></p><p>The &euro;5m in the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; column above relates to the provision of E-Journals, which formed part of the transfer of certain functions from the Department of Education and Skills in May 2010.

This process was very much a first step in considering a range of issues that need to be examined in detail before any proposals can be progressed to possible implementation.  Any formal proposals for changes in the sick pay scheme would be a matter for the Budgetary process, which will be considered in due course by the Government.  </p><p>  To assist me in my consideration of these matters, I asked Forf&aacute;s to examine the potential impact on competitiveness and employment of statutory sick pay, if such a scheme were to be introduced in this country.  The report provided to me by Forf&aacute;s forms part of a deliberative process of Government business and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it at this stage.</p><p>  However, I am aware of the concerns raised by employer representatives that transferring responsibility for the payment of employees&rsquo; sick pay to employers would add to the cost of doing business.  In this context, any such proposals would impact on competitiveness and employment.  The evidence of this impact will need to be weighed against the potential for savings in terms of reduced absences due to sickness. I will carefully scrutinise any proposals which develop from the consultation process and their impact on jobs and competitiveness, and I will contribute fully to the Budgetary process within Government.</p></reply>

Central to IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to build on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, while optimising regional spread, in line with the National Spatial Strategy.</p><p>  The recognition of the importance of Cork as a major gateway location under the National Spatial Strategy continues to assist IDA Ireland in promoting and marketing Cork for inward investment and assists in the development of the necessary critical mass needed in terms of population, skills and infrastructure to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).  Cork has a long industrial and exporting tradition over many centuries based on its deep-water harbour.  Over recent decades, however, the older heavy manufacturing and textiles industries have been replaced by more modern industries, in particular the Life Science and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sectors.  In recent years, the FDI base has expanded with the addition of software, digital media customer support and shared services activities.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has informed me that it continues to promote Cork City and County as an integral part of its Horizon 2020 Strategy in accordance with the National Spatial Strategy.  11 new IDA Ireland supported projects in existing and new IDA client companies were announced for Cork City and County in 2011 which will result in the creation of over 800 new jobs over the coming years. There are currently 133 IDA Ireland supported enterprises in Cork City and County employing 21,522 people.  This is an increase of over 1,000 jobs, or 5%, on the 2010 figure. To date, in 2012, there have been further job announcements with significant investments announced by Eli Lily, Big Fish Games, Pepsi Cola, Apple, Xilinx and M/A Com Tech.</p><p>  Cork continues to demonstrate its ability to grow and evolve to meet the needs of existing and future investors.  As a strong University City with over 30,000 full and part time students at UCC and CIT with the presence of the Tyndall National Institute; improvements in connectivity across road, rail, air and telecoms; and a strong base of existing IDA client companies, Cork has an enviable business ecosystem which ensures that it continues to be a location of choice for overseas companies. IDA Ireland has assured me that the Cork Gateway will continue to play a crucial role in contributing to the delivery of the ambitious jobs targets set out the agency&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Strategy.</p></reply>

This restructuring will include:  the dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI); the development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; for small businesses within Local Authorities.</p><p>  An Implementation Working Group (IWG), under the Chair of my Department, is currently focussed on implementing the Government decision. The IWG, which includes all key stakeholders, is working out the detail of the new arrangements and is to report back to the Minister by the end of the year. In tandem with the work of the IWG my Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements. Clearly, the progress of the legislation will determine the timing of the formal establishment date of the new arrangements coming to effect.</p><p>  Synergies will be achieved in time in terms of a more streamlined model for the delivery of enterprise supports/interventions to the micro-enterprise sector. Some savings on current expenditure are envisaged in the medium term, e.g. on reduced accommodation costs. There will be no savings on staffing. The existing staff of the CEBs will be an integral part of the new arrangements.</p><p>  I will retain responsibility for national enterprise policy and budgets under the restructured micro-enterprise support model. I am confident that the Local Enterprise Office network will bring together best practice from the CEBs, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities and form the platform for enhanced service delivery to our micro and small business sector, which is central to our plans for jobs and growth and ultimately our economic recovery.</p></reply>

Details of jobs created in IDA Ireland client companies by county and by region from 2008 to 2011 are set out in the attached tabular statement. At end 2011, there were 130,499  people employed in 1,004 IDA client companies.</p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, IDA Ireland has been set a target of creating 12,500 new jobs in 2012, with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250 jobs in 2012.  The target for 2013 will be agreed towards the end of 2012, with the overall aim of reaching 62,000 new jobs by 2014 in line with the IDA&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Strategy, which covers the period 2010 to 2014. The actual number of jobs created in 2012 in companies supported by IDA Ireland will not be available until the Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey is published in 2013.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to drive the growth of Irish-owned companies in overseas markets which, in turn, will support existing jobs and new job creation.  Export growth provides a sustainable route for companies to grow their employment EI actively works with its companies to help them to both sustain and create jobs.  A total of more than 162,000 people (full and part-time) directly rely on Enterprise Ireland client companies for their employment.  The number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies in each county between 2008 and 2011 is set out in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>For 2012, the projection for new jobs to be created in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies is 10,300.  This projection is broadly similar to that made for 2012, at this time last year.  A similar number is forecast for 2013.  Projections are not made at a county level.

The Plan contains 270 actions to be implemented in 2012 across all Government Departments as well as 36 State agencies to improve the operating environment for business and remove barriers to employment creation.  The 270 individual actions are further broken down into Quarterly milestones or targets, specifying the body responsible for implementation in each case.  Progress Reports on the delivery of these milestones are published at the end of each Quarter.  </p><p><br />  As part of its commitment to drive the implementation of the Action Plan, the Government established a Committee to monitor the delivery of the Quarterly targets on an on-going basis.  The Monitoring Committee comprises senior officials from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Forf&aacute;s. To date, two Quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan have been published.<font color="#C0C0C0">  </font>The First Progress Report found that 80 of the 83 (96%) measures due to be implemented in the first quarter of the year were delivered on time.  The Second Progress Report found that 72 of the 77 (94%) measures to be implemented in that quarter were delivered on time.  Explanations for measures which were delayed are set out in the Progress Reports which are available on my Department&#8217;s website, .  </p><p><br />  Work on bringing these delayed targets to completion continued and I can report that all eight of the measures which were delayed in Quarter 1 and Quarter 2 have now been implemented.  Therefore, 100% of the measures for delivery under the Action Plan for Jobs for the first half of the year have now been completed.  The Progress Report on the Action Plan deliverables for the Third Quarter of 2012 will be published in mid-October. </p></reply>

However, the Government has a key role to play in providing the environment where businesses can start-up, expand and create jobs.  Within the first 100 days of coming into office, the Government introduced a Jobs Initiative which was aimed at rebuilding confidence in the economy, providing opportunities for re-skilling for those who had lost their jobs, and assisting people to get back to work.</p><p>  Building on the Jobs Initiative, the Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on 13th February last, aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation. The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland. The Government has also identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.The Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  </p><p>  The Action Plan contains over 270 individual measures to be delivered in 2012 which are further broken down into Quarterly milestones.  Progress Reports on the delivery of these milestones are published at the end of each Quarter.  95% of all 160 measures to be implemented in the first two Quarters of 2012 were delivered on time; those that were somewhat delayed have now been completed.   </p><p>  Some significant objectives have been realised, including the introduction of legislation underpinning the Microfinance Fund and the Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, the launch of a Development Capital Fund, new supports for first time exporters and the launch of a National Broadband Plan.   We are reforming supports to small businesses, we have published the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, and we have launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme to help identify and encourage companies that might set up in Ireland.   </p><p>  The positive impact of the Government&rsquo;s policies on job creation are beginning to show.  2011 saw a net increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies and a number of major foreign direct investments have been announcements so far this year.  Enterprise Ireland companies achieved &euro;15.2 billion in exports last year &ndash; the highest level ever &ndash; and employment in the agency&rsquo;s client companies stabilised in 2011 after 30,000 job losses in the period 2007 to 2010.</p><p>  Employment in the tourism sector also increased by 8,700 in the period March 2011 to March 2012, supported in particular by the measures taken in the Jobs Initiative which lowered VAT rates and halved employer&rsquo;s PRSI on earnings up to &euro;356 per week.  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, which will be an annual process setting out clear targets to be delivered each year to support job creation.</p></reply>

To do this, we need to keep costs for business as low as possible, reduce unnecessary administrative burdens and provide supports to enterprises where appropriate.  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  The Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs includes a series of measures for delivery across Government to reduce business costs and improve competitiveness. These include, for example: providing supports to businesses to reduce their costs through energy efficiency measures and the Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme; reforming the statutory wage setting mechanism and making it more appropriate to our modern economy.  The legislation to give effect to this has now been enacted through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012; improving access to finance, including through the temporary Partial Loan Guarantee scheme and the Microfinance Fund. Legislation to underpin these schemes has now been enacted; reducing the administrative burden on business across seven key Departments and the Revenue Commissioners, with a view to achieving a 25% reduction by the end of the year.  Administrative burdens within own Department&rsquo;s area of responsibility has been reduced by over 24% so far, yielding potential savings of &euro;206 million per annum for business; encouraging Local Authorities to freeze or reduce commercial rates.  All but one Local Authority has frozen or reduced their rates for this year.  The remaining Local Authority increased its Annual Rate of Valuation due to a legal requirement following the extension of a town boundary; simplifying and extending the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Incentive scheme, making it easier for employers to hire someone from the Live Register and reduce their payroll costs. </p><p>  The implementation of these and many other measures in the Action Plan for Jobs will help to further improve our international competitiveness and reduce costs for business.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s progress in improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is reflected in the international competitiveness rankings.  The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012, which was published last May, saw Ireland improving four places in the overall rankings to 20th overall.  The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Index 2012-2013 which was published earlier this month also showed Ireland improving two places in the overall rankings, to 27 place.  </p></reply>

To address the issue my Department is currently in the process of introducing two targeted schemes to support an additional flow of credit into the economy namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme.  </p><p><br />  The Microenterprise Loan Fund will improve access to credit for microenterprises and facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus to encourage all would-be entrepreneurs, including those who are unemployed.  It will also add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance or the Seed Capital Scheme.  </p><p><br />  Support will be in the form of loans for up to &#8364;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  The &#8364;10m allocation, supplemented by &#8364;15m borrowing from other sources will generate &#8364;40m in additional lending for microenterprises.  It will help the establishment and growth of microenterprises and create over 3800 jobs at a cost per job of approximately &#8364;3k per job over the 5 year horizon.</p><p><br />  The second initiative being pursued by my Department is the Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme.  This is being introduced for SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and demonstrating their ability to repay the loan is the target of this scheme.  The minimum permissible loan value will be &#8364;10,000 and the maximum will be &#8364;1,000,000.  The Guarantee Scheme will facilitate up to &#8364;150 million of additional lending per annum for SMEs.  The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, assuming &#8364;150 million of additional lending, include: over 1,000 jobs created and over &#8364;25m of exchequer benefits in tax revenues and welfare cost savings.</p><p><br />  In addition to these initiatives the Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI) and Development Capital Schemes are helping Irish companies access credit in the current difficult environment.  IFI is a key pillar of support for dynamic new industries, and investments.  The Fund facilitates job creation in innovative export focused sectors as well as providing a return to the exchequer over time.  &#8364;250 million was made available to the Fund to make commitments. </p><p><br />  Under the Scheme, Enterprise Ireland requires Venture Capital fund managers to establish an office in Ireland and to invest the equivalent of the Enterprise Ireland commitment in Irish companies or companies with significant operations in Ireland. Aside from these conditions, Enterprise Ireland invests on the same terms as the private sector sharing the risk and the rewards.  A second call for proposals was issued earlier this year following the announcement of the first investment under the first call for expressions of interest. Application under this are currently being evaluated and decision are expected shortly.  The Development Capital Scheme has been developed to complement the existing suite of financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland (EI) to business.</p><p><br />  Longer-term investment capital is currently not readily available to Irish growth focused companies in either the form of debt or equity, and there is very limited private equity funds/debt available to innovative SMEs.  This situation has resulted in an equity gap, which is constraining the development of a key cohort of established Irish growth companies.  </p><p><br />  The exchequer funding requirement for this scheme is &#8364;50m over 10 years.  It is proposed that EI will commit &#8364;25m each to two funds which will leverage a further &#8364;50m each from the private sector. Fund investments supported by EI under this scheme will be made with the State sharing equally in the risks alongside investors.  The proposed scheme will focus on funds that provide equity or quasi debt of between &#8364;2m to &#8364;10m per investment although it is likely that many investments would be in the &#8364;2m to &#8364;5m range.  The Scheme was launched on the 12 April 2012 and a call was issued by Enterprise Ireland for &#8216;<i>expressions of interest&#8217;</i>, from fund managers, with a closing date of 16 July 2012, for receipt of expressions.  The Scheme is currently under review.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the Act is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system. The Act provides for a radical overhaul of the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</p><p>  In addition, the Act provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the High Court judgment. </p><p>  The new Section 41A of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) provides that reviews of the JLCs will be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act. I understand that the work will begin on the process shortly. The outcome of these reviews will inform the Labour Court as to whether any JLC should be maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended (new section 41(A) (4) of the 1946 Act). Accordingly, any discussion in an existing JLC on a new Employment Regulation Order would be seen as anticipating the outcome of the reviews.</p><p>  I have also moved to implement a number of additional reforms that will complement the measures provided for in the Bill and which arise from the Duffy/Walsh Report.  Using my powers under section 40 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, I have requested the Labour Court to put in train the necessary steps for the abolition of the three JLCs (the Aerated Waters and Wholesale Bottling; Provender Milling and Clothing JLCs) as set out in Recommendation 3 of the Duffy/Walsh Report, on the basis that these sectors have declined considerably in terms of numbers employed, or have effectively ceased to function as wage fixing bodies.</p><p>  I have also asked the Labour Relations Commission to begin work on the formulation of two Codes of Practice. The first, on Sunday Working, will provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives in sectors covered by Employment Regulation Orders, on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. The second will address the standardisation of benefits in the nature of pay &ndash; including overtime and the conditions under which it becomes payable &ndash; across sectors covered by JLCs. </p></reply>

There is also an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process, together with long-established dispute settling institutions that play an important role in disputes relating to collective bargaining.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to ensure that Irish law on employees&rsquo; rights to engage in collective bargaining is consistent with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights. Giving effect to this commitment will require consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004. This consultation process will be initiated in the near future.  I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile our constitutional, social and economic traditions, and our international obligations, as well as ensure continued success in attracting investment into our economy. </p></reply>

Agreement was reached with the Troika on the reversal.  The increase was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 and effected by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Section 11) (No. 2) Order 2011 from July 1 2011.  The restoration of the National Minimum Wage to &euro;8.65 per hour represents a significant commitment by the Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.

Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.djei.ie</p><p>  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include: In Company Law, savings of &euro;82 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts; the audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law. This will achieve potential savings for Irish SMEs of approximately &euro;2.8 million annually; in Health &amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.</p><p>  The reorganisation of the State's five existing Employment Rights and Industrial Relations bodies, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website, www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.</p><p>  My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then plan how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. The Revenue&rsquo;s report on its administrative burden reductions, which have reached the 25% target, has been published on its website. </p><p>  Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and, in this regard, the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its Work Programme for 2012. These areas are currently being considered and the findings will be published in the Group&rsquo;s annual report later this year. </p></reply>

The measures in the Government&#8217;s <i>Action Plan on Jobs</i> together with those to support the unemployed to return to the workforce in <i>Pathways to Work</i>   are consistent with the approach in the European Union&#8217;s guidelines for national employment policies to help to create conditions favourable to job creation through enhancing, at the same time, flexibility and security in the labour market. </p><p><br />  The <i>Employment Performance Monitor 2012</i> endorsed by the  EU Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) in June 2012 identified the continuing rate of decline in nominal and real unit labour costs as particularly positive outcomes of Ireland&#8217;s recent labour market performance.  The decline in unit labour costs means that productivity has increased faster than earnings &#8211; thus indicating an improvement in competitiveness. While the rate of growth in Irish unit labour costs significantly exceeded the OECD and euro area averages between 2005 and 2008, unit labour costs in Ireland have been falling consistently since then. Unit labour costs are improving faster in the internationally trading manufacturing sector than in more closed sectors of the economy. In its recent <i>European Economic Forecast for Spring 2012</i>, the European Commission noted an improved performance in Ireland&#8217;s export sector and also growth in Ireland&#8217;s indigenous firms due to competitiveness improvements and the continuing fall in unit labour costs on the back of productivity improvements and wage moderation<i>.</i>   Irish labour wage rates &#8211; when adjusted for productivity &#8211; are becoming more cost competitive. </p><p><br />  The enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 allows for a reduction in the number of Employment Regulations Orders (EROs) and in the number of minimum wage rates that can be set in each ERO, and excludes conditions of employment covered in other legislation such as Sunday premium rates. The overall effect of reforms in the legal framework for the Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements will be to make minimum wage setting mechanisms more responsive to changing economic circumstances and to enhance competitiveness and preserve jobs in the affected sectors.</p><p><br />  Ireland&#8217;s labour market flexibilities are acknowledged as a valuable accompaniment of our open economy, high level of human capital and business friendly environment.  The quality of Ireland&#8217;s labour market ranks highly in international comparisons. In the 2012 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, Ireland is ranked first in terms of availability of skilled labour and first for the flexibility and adaptability of people. </p><p><br />  The Action Plan for Jobs identifies the scope for reducing the cost of business and easing new recruitment through a series of initiatives, including: simplifying and extending the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, which exempts employers from liability to pay their share of PRSI for certain employees. The scheme has been extended to cover the first 18 months of employment; the National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals in organizations in the private, public and community &amp; voluntary sectors; the Revenue Job Assist Scheme provides incentives to employers through a double deduction and for employees through additional tax allowances for those unemployed for at least 12 months; the incentive scheme to encourage foreign mobile talent (SARP) will allow multinationals and indigenous companies to attract people to create more jobs and facilitate business expansion in Ireland.</p><p>High unemployment remains a difficult challenge and requires resolute action through the transformation of labour market activation policies along the lines outlined in the Government&#8217;s policy statement   <i>Pathways to Work.</i></p></reply>

Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost and this is reflected in the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s rating improved four places from 24th to 20th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012.  Earlier this month, the World Economic Forum also reported that Ireland has improved its competitiveness ranking, from 29th to 27th   place in that organisation&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Index.</p><p>  Despite these encouraging trends, we must ensure that the improvements we have achieved in our competitiveness are structural in nature and sustained in the longer-term.  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs includes a range of initiatives to improve our competitiveness, including measures to: </p><p>- promote investment in innovation and research,</p><p>- reduce costs for businesses, </p><p>- align skills with enterprise needs,</p><p>- prioritise infrastructural investment, and </p><p>-  reduce costs through sensible regulation.</p><p>  Details of the specific measures to be taken in each of these areas are available in the Action Plan for Jobs which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.djei.ie.  I am also commencing drafting of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs which will have a strong focus on continuing to improve Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.1550.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800085#WRKK01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 600 and 608 together. </p><p><br />  When we launched the Action Plan for Jobs in February, we stated very clearly that there was no &#8216;big bang&#8217; solution to the jobs crisis, and that what was needed was a determined, step-by-step implementation of our Plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs.  We are making solid progress and have already put in place a number of measures which will make a practical difference in making it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs. </p><p><br />  The Action Plan for Jobs addresses many of the concerns of small business through specific national initiatives which will benefit small businesses across the country, including those areas of particular interest to the Deputy.  In particular, two pro-jobs finance measures targeting companies of different sizes will go &#8220;live&#8221; by the end of this month, as follows: the &#8364;90m Micro Finance Loan Scheme targeting micro-enterprises and the &#8364;450m Credit Guarantee Scheme, targeting SMEs  </p><p><br />  The Micro Finance Loan Scheme will initially facilitate &#8364;40m in additional lending to businesses employing not more than 10 people over the next five years, with provision for the scheme to be extended to provide an additional &#8364;50m of lending over a further five years at that point. Start-ups, sole traders and existing micro-enterprises will be eligible to apply for a loan under the Scheme.</p><p><br />  The Credit Guarantee Scheme will facilitate &#8364;150m per annum in additional lending for SMEs who, because of a lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.</p><p><br />  The Agencies under my Department are also rolling out their plans of support for businesses on the North side. Enterprise Ireland is actively promoting entrepreneurship in Dublin and provides a range of enterprise programmes and other initiatives to approximately 500 companies on the North side to ensure that emerging technologies and business ideas with export potential are supported to become a commercial reality. </p><p><br />  There are currently 1,290 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Dublin City and Fingal County, employing over 27,000 people in full-time employment and almost 5,600 people in contract or part-time jobs. In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid out &#8364;21.5m in funding to client companies in Dublin City and &#8364;4.6m to companies in Fingal. To date in 2012, the agency has paid out almost &#8364;11m to companies in the areas covered by Dublin City and Fingal.</p><p><br />  In February this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a new Community Enterprise Centre (CEC) Programme for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in Community Enterprise Centres funded by the agency. Since the foundation of the first CEC Programme in 1989, Enterprise Ireland has paid out more than &#8364;2.4m in funding to six Community Enterprise Centres on the North side of Dublin, two of which are based in Coolock and Darndale.</p><p><br />  '<i>New Frontiers&#8217;</i>  , Ireland&#8217;s largest entrepreneur development programme, was also launched in February 2012.  New Frontiers is funded and coordinated by Enterprise Ireland and provides &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology to deliver the programme at a local level.  The core element of New Frontiers is a six-month intensive programme which will focus on developing the person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities, equipping them with the skills they need to run, and crucially develop, sustainable businesses.  On Dublin&#8217;s North side, DCU is involved in delivering the programme, in conjunction with Dundalk Institute of Technology.</p><p><br />  On 7th July 2012, I announced the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of a &#8364;250,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund.  The Fund is open for applications until 4th September 2012, and is part of a drive to boost the number of innovative, export-oriented businesses being set-up and led by female entrepreneurs. </p><p><br />  Dublin City Enterprise Board and Fingal County Enterprise Board support enterprise development and job creation throughout the North side of Dublin, through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance for small business. Hundreds of companies will benefit from start-up grants, mentoring and management development training.</p><p><br />  IDA Ireland, in accordance with its strategy of securing high-quality foreign direct investment (FDI) for Ireland, continues to promote Dublin and its surrounding areas as a Metro Region, that is, a region with a population in excess of one million inhabitants that has a critical mass in terms of skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.  This strategy has been very successful as Dublin is recognised as one of Europe&#8217;s leading business locations and is home to many of the world&#8217;s leading companies such as Google, eBay, PayPal, Pfizer, and IBM, amongst others.  There are 492 IDA Ireland client companies in Dublin employing almost 52,000 people in permanent full time employment and more than 5,075 people in other positions.  </p></reply>

I should point out that under the terms of the 2003 and 2006 Employment Permit Acts non EEA nationals in full time employment are obliged to hold a current employment permit as well as other relevant permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to work in the State.</p><p>  In terms of consideration of employment permit applications the terms and requirements of the Employment Permit Acts and EU Community preference obligations prescribe that preference is given to the employment needs of Irish and EU citizens. Therefore our Employment Permit regime requires employers to advertise employment vacancies both nationally and across the EU.</p><p>  Furthermore, due to the significant recent increase in the number of unemployed people in Ireland, the job categories eligible for employment permits has been restricted in recent years so as to ensure that all possible employment opportunities are provided to the unemployed. Exceptions are made where skills are in shortage and where continuing shortages would damage our economy. Finally, eligibility is also based on salary levels as this is indicative of the scope and importance of the skills requirement and also helps to minimise possible impact on State supports.  While employment permits may be sought in respect of those named by the Deputy I would advise that applicants consider the above factors in preparing employment permit applications.</p></reply>

Neither did the ILO find that a resolution of the difficulties arising over the Ryanair judgement would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition. </p><p>  Accordingly, recommendations (a) and (c) have been accepted and will be addressed in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the current law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining (the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001), so as to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>  As regards the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation for an independent enquiry, the Ryanair case has been litigated to a conclusion. In light of the judgment of the Supreme Court, it was open to the parties to resume the hearing before the Labour Court or, indeed, to make fresh complaints to the Labour Court. However, it would be constitutionally inappropriate for the Government to reopen matters by seeking to establish facts that were not established before the courts and a fortiori to take measures that the courts did not take. </p><p>  In addition, the power of the Government to undertake an inquiry is contained in section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, which allows the relevant Minister to request the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court or another person or body to conduct an inquiry where the Minister is of the opinion that a particular trade dispute is a dispute of special importance. However, in this case, the Supreme Court has determined that it had not been established that there was a trade dispute. This precludes the Minister from requesting an inquiry under section 38(2) of the 1990 Act. Accordingly, this recommendation has not been accepted.  I have advised the International Labour Organisation of our position on the recommendations.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Get Export Ready&rsquo; programme includes practical measures for early exporters focusing on export readiness, the importance of research, developing a value proposition and the skills of export selling.  It supports and helps to prepare companies interested in targeting international markets to confront the challenges that any company faces as it prepares to export.  Approximately 80 companies from Co. Waterford have sought assistance from the Potential Exporters Division since the beginning of March 2012, when the Division was established.  These include calls to the help desk, attendees at Export Awareness Events and participants at the Exploring Exporting Workshops.  </p></reply>

To contribute to achieving this objective, Enterprise Ireland launched a new competitive programme called the &ldquo;Competitive Start Fund&rdquo; in December 2010.  The purpose of the Competitive Start Fund is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets.  The Competitive Start Fund provides support of up to &euro;50,000 in equity matched by &euro;5,000 of promoters equity to companies to test and prove product/market fit at an earlier stage of development.</p><p>  This fund is open to applications from early stage companies from the following sectors: Internet, Games, Mobile, Apps, SaaS, Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Lifesciences, Cleantech and Industrial Products, who meet the relevant eligibility criteria. Since the launch of the Competitive Start Fund in December 2010, Enterprise Ireland has had over 800 applications across 7 calls with 100 companies receiving &euro;50,000 of equity funding. To date, Enterprise Ireland have received applications from 12 businesses in Co Waterford with one company being approved &euro;50,000.  The next call for applications will open on September 26th   2012. </p></reply>

However, company closures are up 6% on this figure (8,664) essentially meaning a contraction in the number of companies operating in our economy&#8221;.</i></p><p><br />  These figures represent the whole economy and are challenges which this Government is facing up to on a daily basis.  It is an unfortunate reality that companies for a wide range of reasons find themselves in difficulty and early intervention is critically important. For this reason, the Enterprise Development agencies operate an early warning system, which has been in place for over ten years. When triggered, this mechanism brings the full capacity of the agency concerned to bear on whatever situation has arisen within the client company.</p><p><br />  For example, when Enterprise Ireland is made aware of jobs at risk, it engages closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job loses to determine what appropriate proactive measures can be put in place by the agency to prevent or minimise the job losses.</p><p><br />  When IDA Ireland becomes aware of a company's intention to either downsize or cease operating in Ireland, it works with the client company to safeguard and minimise the number of job losses through offering to help the companies to improve competitiveness; enhance their use of technology; grow the skills of their employees; engage in research, development and innovation or develop their business processes.</p><p><br />  Similarly, as soon as Shannon Development becomes aware of jobs at risk, it proactively engages with companies to offer whatever supports are available to minimise the impact as regards job losses.  There are many differing and complex factors that can influence a firm's decision to relocate in today&#8217;s modern globalised economic environment. Companies change location to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, in addition to business takeovers and consolidations. Recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is on-going in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change. This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.</p><p><br />  The early warning system is kept under review so as to ensure that it is fit for purpose.</p></reply>

The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence. Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.</p><p><br />  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the Courts&#8217; scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the Court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned, in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.</p><p><br />  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such non-nationals should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants which find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. </p><p><br />  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and that I would expect deliberations on the matter to be concluded within a matter of<font color="#A16252"> </font>  months.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers.  Many young people will benefit from the opportunities provided through these programmes. The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs contains over 270 measures to be delivered across all 15 Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  My Department and its agencies play a central role in the delivery of approximately 60% of those measures, and have a supporting role in many other actions. </p><p>  Pathways to Work includes various training, education and work experience initiatives delivered by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection.  Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and Back to Education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.</p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills will provide over 450,000 education and training places this year across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors. These places will include provision for school leavers, although the long-term unemployed are a priority target.  The twin strategies outlined are available to businesses and unemployed persons from the North side of Dublin. It is not possible to set detailed location-specific job targets for the Enterprise Agencies because many of their activities are enterprise-led rather than agency-led.</p><p>  All of the agencies have regional structures to maximise local opportunities.  This regional spread allows the agencies to drive take-up of their services and supports such as entrepreneurship programmes focused on identifying new business opportunities at a local level.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has a network of 110 Community Enterprise Centres in operation across the regions, including six on the North side of Dublin.</p></reply>

It provides that:</p><p>      Member States shall prohibit traders from charging consumers in respect of the use of a given means of payment fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of such means.</p><p>  While Member States are required to transpose the Directive into national law by December 2013, I have decided that Article 19 should be given early effect in Ireland.  My Department has recently published a consultation paper on Article 19 and a related provision on additional payments at Article 22 of the Directive with a view to enacting both provisions by end 2012 or early 2013. The consultation paper can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.djei.ie).</p><p>  While Article 19 applies to cases where a business imposes a payment charge on consumers who pay by methods other than direct debit, it has been clarified by the European Commission that it does not cover cases where a business offers a discount to consumers who pay by direct debit. Prohibiting traders from offering discounts for payments made by direct debit or other means would appear to be precluded in any event by Article 52(3) of Directive 2007/64/EC on Payment Services in the Internal Market; the Directive was given effect in Ireland by the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 383 of 2009). Article 52(3) empowers Member States to forbid or limit payment charges subject to specified conditions, but gives no such right in respect of price reductions for the use of a particular payment method.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.1597.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRLL01600"><p>I am aware that the UK is considering a &ldquo;mini-jobs&rdquo; model, similar to that which has been in operation in Germany for the past number of years, which allows people to earn up to a certain limit each month without paying tax or social insurance.  There are differing views on the merits of such a model, including the prospect of full-time jobs being split into several &ldquo;mini-jobs&rdquo; to reduce or avoid income tax.</p><p>  The Irish Government&rsquo;s objective is to create a business environment which supports the creation of new jobs and the retention of existing ones.  Through the Jobs Initiative, the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, the Government has introduced a range of measures to achieve this objective.  </p><p>  For example, under the Jobs Initiative, the Government reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on a range of services in labour-intensive sectors.  It also halved employers&rsquo; PRSI on payroll costs of up to &euro;356 per week.  These measures helped to support an increase in employment in the hospitality sector in the first quarter of 2102, as reported in the Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 7 June.  </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs contains 270 measures for delivery across all Government Departments and 36 Agencies to support job creation.  These include simplification of the Employers&rsquo; PRSI Exemption scheme and the improved promotion of Revenue&rsquo;s Job Assist scheme, both of which provide financial benefits to employers who take on people from the Live Register.  </p><p>  Pathways to Work also provides a range of measures to support individuals to move from the Live Register into employment, including Springboard skills conversion courses and the JobBridge internship programme.</p><p>  The Government will continue to deliver and build on these initiatives in preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs, and will be open to exploring further ideas which can support the creation of jobs in the economy.</p><p>  In the meantime, details of a range of practical supports available to business to help them start up, grow and create jobs is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.djei.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.1600.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRLL01800"><p>The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on liquid fuel products in Ireland.  The price of fuel is dictated by global factors and reflects global market price (traded in dollars), Euro/Dollar fluctuations, refining costs, transportation costs, other operating costs, prevailing Excise Duty and VAT.</p><p><br />  Recent increases in prices may be attributable to a number of factors, including increases in crude oil prices, the strengthening dollar and taxation increases necessitated by the current difficult budgetary situation.</p><p><br />  The Competition Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State.  Under section 30(2), I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, can request the Authority to carry out a study or analysis of any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or any other matter relating to competition and to submit a report to me.  In the absence of price control measures on liquid fuel products, the Authority has no function in relation to pricing policies or strategies unless anti-competitive practices such as price fixing are in operation.  Competition law prohibits undertakings from engaging in activities which prevent, restrict or distort trade or which constitute an abuse of a dominant position in such trade.  The Authority investigates anti-competitive practices on its own initiative or on foot of complaints received.  If the Deputy is alleging anti-competitive practices I urge him to make a complaint to the Authority which can be contacted via its website   . </p><p><br />  I would point out to the Deputy that the National Consumer Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, carried out a survey in 2008 in relation to the pricing of certain products in the liquid fuels market.  The Agency&#8217;s report on this matter, which was published on 19<sup>th</sup>  December 2008, found that in the main price changes for refined petroleum products were being passed on to consumers in a relatively timely fashion, that profits of oil companies involved in the downstream supply of refined oil product suppliers in Ireland were relatively modest and that many fuel retailers were becoming more and more dependent on non-fuel retail offerings to sustain revenue and margin opportunities.  The Agency&#8217;s report did highlight the importance of the availability of price information in terms of empowering consumers to achieve the best value for money when purchasing liquid fuel products.</p><p><br />  The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997 (SI No 178 of 1997) requires all persons selling certain fuel products to specify by way of a public notice on their premises the price per litre being charged to the consumer for these commodities.  Accordingly, I would strongly encourage consumers to inform themselves of the different price offerings in their localities so as to enable them to proactively seek out the best value when purchasing fuel products.</p></reply>

The nature and frequency of these inspections will vary dependent on the use and location of the equipment. </p><p>  Employers are further required to ensure that employees have been instructed in the carrying out of visual checks for any signs of damage.  </p><p>  Where equipment is located in environments that are safe from accidental damage or environmental degradation and are rarely moved there should not be a need to have the equipment tested unless a risk assessment shows otherwise. In circumstances where deterioration is anticipated, and where this deterioration might cause danger, the employer should establish a scheme of periodic inspection by a competent person.</p><p>  In addition to these periodic inspections, the portable equipment and associated leads and plug tops must be tested and certified as being safe by a person competent to carry out such tests.  If the certificate issued indicates that the equipment is not safe, then the equipment must not be used until it has been made safe and has been certified as such.</p><p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing and promoting occupational safety and health law. In line with the approach to risk based inspection the issues that are addressed at any place of work will be evidence led. The Authority has identified the presence of correctly functioning residual current devices as key to minimising risk and preventing shock or electrocution, which is also a collective protective measure. The inspection of places of work may assess the controls relating to electricity based on documented risk assessment, visual examination and the presence and maintenance of key controls such as residual current devices. Where the evidence of inspection warrants it then the issue of electrical safety will be addressed in more detail.  </p><p>  I am satisfied, taking account of indications from the Authority&rsquo;s inspection experience and incident history that the approach to enforcement is appropriate.</p></reply>

To this end, last year I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. Among the issues provided for under the Advisory Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference is for the Group to examine and report on the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons.</p><p>  The Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. Decisions on the publication of the Group&rsquo;s reports will be made subsequently at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600.00 per week.  All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF - rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership or liquidation.  </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.</p><p>  I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  In term of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.   The Budget 2012 changes were given legislative effect in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012. The new changes apply where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy occurs on or after 1 January 2012.  </p><p>  I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to fund the cost of making people redundant &ndash; often from very profitable companies.  </p><p>  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012, the approach taken in other countries was examined and it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.   While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.1637.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRMM01200"><p>The unemployment rate is currently 14.7% and while it has stabilised after several years of increases, the rate remains unacceptably high. It is of additional concern that long-term unemployment accounts for 61% of total unemployment, and for almost half of all unemployment among young people. In the first instance, the Government&#8217;s primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economy recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the <b><i>Action Plan for Jobs</i></b> .  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. </p><p><br />  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the long-term unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. Past experience suggests that, without such measures, long-term unemployment may fall more slowly than overall unemployment when strong economic growth returns.</p><p><br />  In this context, the major elements of the Government&#8217;s response are set out in the  <b><i>Pathways to Work </i></b>  policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  </p><p><b>Pathways to Work</b></p><p><br />  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed.  The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service&#8217;s activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for: transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach; more regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were over 87,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in the first eight months of 2012; greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge &#8211; the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative; incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed; creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  One such measure is the Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.</p><p><br />  The Pathways to Work policy sets very ambitious targets to be achieved over the next three years; to ensure that 75,000 of those long term unemployed will move into employment by 2015; to reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months; to ensure that employers have access to and are offered suitable candidate to fill full time vacancies and that the proportion of vacancies filled by the Department&#8217;s employment services from the Live Register is at least to 40% by 2015; to ensure that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State as a pre-condition for recipe of their welfare payments.</p><p><b>Education &amp; Training</b></p><p><br />  The Government has also taken various initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. The most prominent schemes in this regard are the Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Initiative. In the 2010/2011 academic year there were 25,000 participants on the Back to Education Allowance scheme, with similar numbers expected for 2011/2012. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. All courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel. Participants on Springboard courses retain their social welfare payments.  Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. Over 3,500 people are due to graduate this month from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011 and an additional 6,000 places are being made available for this academic year.</p><p><br />  The State is also providing a wide range of vocational training options outside of the mainstream education system that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. Specific Skills Training courses are employment-led and lead to qualifications that offer learners both generic and advanced skills. The expected outcomes are progression to employment in the occupational field or to further and higher education/training and the achievement of certification from levels 5 &#8211; 7 in the National Qualifications Framework.  The training system also provides Apprenticeships and Traineeships which entail significant skill requirements best acquired through a combination of alternating periods of on and off-the-job training.  There were some 27,000 participants on these three FAS programmes in 2011. The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.</p><p><br />  In addition to these programmes, the Government is providing &#8364;20 million from the National Training Fund for a new <b><i>Labour Market Education and Training Fund </i></b>  for the long-term unemployed. This fund, which will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed, will deliver upwards of 6,500 training places provided by the private sector on a competitive-tender basis.</p></reply>

The Quarterly National Household survey indicated that there were 56,000 young unemployed aged 15-24 in Q1 2012, made up of 15,000 aged 15-19 and 41,000 aged 20-24.

The Report of the Group, which recommends a scheme for the legal recognition of transgender persons, was approved by the Government on 12 July 2011, and was subsequently published on 14 July, 2011.  </p><p>  Since the publication of the Report, the Department has been working on developing draft Heads of a Gender Recognition Bill. In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March, my Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues. </p><p>  The external counsel&rsquo;s legal opinion on these issues was recently received in my Department and will inform discussions between officials in my Department, the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice and Equality and external counsel. The outcome of these discussions will continue to inform the drafting of the Heads of a Bill. Given the sensitive and complex nature of the issues involved, it is my intention to ask the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to discuss draft Heads of Bill once they are completed. </p><p>  With regard to intersex persons the GRAG concluded that addressing the inclusion of the intersex condition required more research and medical expertise than was available to it. In addition, the Group was concerned that the intersex condition was outside its specific remit to advise on the legislation required to provide for the legal recognition of transgender people.</p></reply>

This refusal has been upheld by the HSE appeals office. While the person concerned would qualify for rent supplement at the single rate for self-contained accommodation in Kildare, he has not provided any documentation to indicate that the rent has ever been reduced to that rate. Throughout the application process, the person concerned has only ever provided the Department with one lease which stated that the rent was &euro;700.00 per month whereas the approved rent limit is &euro;400.00 per month. If the person concerned wishes to appeal this decision, he must appeal directly to the Chief Appeals Officer who functions independently of the Department.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  </p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   </p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of  the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be generally available in the next few days, has examined this matter.   </p><p>  Self-employed individuals who fall on hard times or are without work for some time may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments.  Those who have been previously self-employed can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department, including expenditure on weekly and other payments, will be considered in the context of Budget 2013 and subsequent Budgets.  Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a pre-requisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system.  The Government&#8217;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years. </p><p><br />  There are, therefore, considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  The scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.  There is no question of introducing changes by stealth.  If the Government decides to change eligibility rules or make other changes to achieve savings, any such measures will be announced in the Budget and will be debated in this House.  <font color="#008000"> </font></p><p><font color="#008000">  </font>Looking ahead to the preparations for Budget 2013, I will appear before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection on the 26<sup>th</sup> of  September next to discuss Budget 2013.

I will be holding a pre-Budget forum on 12<sup>th</sup> October of this year, to which I have invited thirty five groups, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I will listen carefully to their submissions in relation to the next Budget.  In addition, I will take into account the views of the MABS, which operates under the aegis of the Citizen&#8217;s Information Board, an agency of my Department.  </p></reply>

It is a fundamental qualifying condition for these benefits that a person must be available for full-time work.  A person is entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance where, inter alia, they are fully unemployed for at least 3 days in any period of 6 consecutive days (Sundays are currently excluded from this calculation).</p><p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of atypical workers.  In acknowledgement of this trend, the Department conducted a &lsquo;Review of the Application of the Unemployment Benefit and Assistance Schemes Conditions to Workers who are not employed on a full-time basis&rsquo; in 2006, which examined the application of the jobseekers benefit and allowance scheme conditions to workers who are employed on a part-time, casual or systematic short-time basis. </p><p>  The review made a number of recommendations which are currently under consideration by a  Departmental working group.  These considerations are complex and are taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative and IT change that implementing proposals based on these recommendations would require.</p></reply>

The Deputy may wish to note that the Department operates a number of schemes which are designed to encourage people who are dependent on certain social welfare payments to pursue self employment opportunities.  These opportunities can include the setting up of a taxi business.</p><p><br />  The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) allows a person who has been unemployed for over 12 months to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years on entering employment or self-employment.  The short term enterprise allowance (STEA) allows a person who qualifies for jobseekers&#8217; benefit payment to retain this payment for the duration of their job seekers entitlement if they take up a self-employment opportunity.  For both schemes the applicant must set up business for the purpose of self-employment.  The business venture has to be approved by one of the local development companies or one of this Department&#8217;s job facilitators.<b></b>The business venture must be deemed to be viable and sustainable and must not involve displacement of existing business in the same industry or sector. In assessing viability, cognisance is taken of the demand for, and supply of, the particular service at local level.</p><p><br />  Those approved under either back to work schemes may also avail of additional financial support from the technical assistance and training scheme (TATS).  Under this scheme a person may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of &#8364;1,000 to offset the cost of certain start-up expenses such as training in the areas of business start-up, bookkeeping and accounts, taxation, preparation of business plans, marketing, public liability insurance, literacy and computer training or assistance with the purchase of small items of equipment and tools.</p></reply>

In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman comes under the remit of the Department but it does not have a Board. </p><p>  The Social Welfare Tribunal deals with cases where entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or assistance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute.  The Tribunal consists of a Chairman and four ordinary members and does not have a day to day operating function. Members do not receive an annual salary, instead they are paid fees for attending hearings or meetings, they also qualify for Travel and Subsistence expenses if appropriate. Additional expenditure may arise in respect of room hire for Hearings/Meetings. Referrals to the tribunal are very infrequent and no such referrals have occurred for almost two years.  For that reason, there was no expenditure in relation to the Social Welfare Tribunal in 2011 and there has been no expenditure in 2012 to date.  There are no plans to merge the Social Welfare Tribunal with any other state body.</p><p>  The total Budget allocation to the CIB for 2012 is &euro;46.843m.

There are no plans to merge that combined service with any other. </p><p>  My Department provides an annual grant to the Pensions Board specifically to fund a public awareness campaign, the National Pensions Awareness Campaign.  The grant for 2012 was &euro;400,000. The Department provides no other funding to the Board, as it meets its administration costs from fees collected from occupational pension schemes and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs).  There is no Exchequer funding involved for the day to day running of the Pensions Board. </p><p>  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is independent in its function and comes under the remit of my Department.  The 2012 Estimate for Pensions Ombudsman is &euro;1.025m.</p><p>  In terms of rationalisation, the integration of the regulatory functions of the Pensions Board with the Financial Regulator and the merging of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman are the subject of a critical review under the Public Service Reform Programme.

The report of the seminar which I hosted in February 2012 has been published and the Department has also met separately with key stakeholders.</p><p>  I can assure the House that the range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme &ndash; the extent of coverage; the rate of payment; possible compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate and how the scheme would be enforced and policed &ndash; will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of Budget 2013, and the views of stakeholder groups, such as the SFA, will be taken into account in that process.</p></reply>

The policy for entertainment allowances is governed by the Department of Finance circular 25/2000.  Refreshments/lunches provided at training courses mainly relate to the purchase of refreshments and catering supplies for the provision of tea, coffee, biscuits, etc. by the Department&rsquo;s Staff Development Units for training courses.  Lunches were also provided at a small number of training courses.  Catering Services/Supplies refers to tea, coffee and biscuits provided at various departmental meetings.  Beverages (Customer Service Conference Expenses) relates to refreshments provided at Customer Focus/Services Group meetings.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Social Protection employs more staff than any other Department.  There were 7,011 people employed in the Department on 31 July 2012.  The Department is also a very diverse organisation both in terms of the wide range of services it provides and in terms of the large number of locations at which it provides services. It operates out of almost 1,000 locations nationally, including 12 headquarters in Dublin and 10 decentralised locations outside Dublin, 66 local offices and it provides services at some 897 other locations throughout the State.  This large scale and diversity necessitates a significant commitment to meetings, training and other interactions between staff and is also reflected in the incidental expenses associated with such interactions.  For example, the food costs set out above in relation to training were incurred in the context of providing 7,513 training days from 1 March 2011 to 7 September 2012.  This is an average of &euro;2.26 per training day.</p></reply>

However, on the basis of her experience and qualifications, I sought sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 October 2011 to place her on a salary on par with her previous remuneration and received sanction to place her on the 3rd point of the scale i.e. &euro;86,604 per annum.  Ms. Barrington progressed to the next point of the scale i.e. &euro;89,898 with effect from 18 July 2012.</p><p>As Edward Brophy was previously employed in the private sector on a salary package that was more than twice the highest point of the Principal Officer (standard) scale, I sought sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for remuneration in excess of the applicable pay scale grade.  A single point salary of &euro;127,796 was sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform effective from 29 July 2011.

These cost elements include insurance, full membership of AA/RAC, road tax and licence.  The engine size of my car is 1400cc and the rate applicable is 46.25 cent per kilometre.

The total cost of employing two drivers from May 2011 to date is &euro;72,422.13.

The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting. </p><p><br />  The social welfare code recognised the couple status of opposite sex co-habiting couples and treated married and opposite sex co-habiting couples in a similar manner for means testing and other purposes for many years prior to the enactment of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act, 2010.  Following the enactment of that Act, further changes in the definition of a couple for social welfare purposes were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2010.  These changes amended the social welfare code to recognise the introduction of civil partnership.  In addition, the code was also amended to treat cohabiting same sex couples in the same way as cohabiting opposite sex couples.  Consequently, married couples, civil partners, same sex cohabiting couples and opposite sex cohabiting couples are treated in the same manner for means testing purposes for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and other means tested schemes. </p><p><br />  For means testing purposes, account is taken of the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse/partner, including the earnings of the claimant and spouse.  Where either or both of a couple has earnings from employment, the gross earnings less PRSI contributions, pension contributions and trade union subscriptions are assessed as means.  Deductions in respect of income tax are not allowable. </p><p><br />  Given the full equality of treatment of couples within the social welfare system as described above, I consider the current arrangements fair.  The income tax arrangements and legislation for married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples generally are a matter for the Minister for Finance. </p></reply>

Over 9,900 internship placements have commenced since 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011, with 4,817 internships in place as at 6<sup>th</sup> September 2012 and over 1,800 opportunities presently advertised on  .  Our records indicate that almost 40% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment immediately on completion of their internship placements. This represents very significant progress in a short period of time.  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained pending the independent evaluation of the Scheme which is currently ongoing.</p><p><br />  The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for the unemployed.  It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those in receipt of a Live Claim.  The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</p><p><br />  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those in receipt of a Live Claim close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that those availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &#8364;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment .opportunities as the economy improves.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources to those in receipt of a Live Claim so as to increase their chances of gaining employment thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time. </p><p><br />  For the reasons outlined above, the JobBridge Scheme is not currently open to those in receipt of blind persons pension or disability benefit.  However, all aspects of the Scheme including eligibility criteria will be reviewed following the independent evaluation of the Scheme.</p><p><br />  It is worth noting that those in receipt of blind persons pension are eligible to participate on the Work Placement Programme. </p></reply>

Currently the average time taken to award a carer&rsquo;s allowance application is 28 weeks. </p><p>  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer&rsquo;s allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Carer&rsquo;s allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  The outcome of the review is the division of work into two steams.  One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processed these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its outcome.  However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.  The allocation of available resourced to this task continues to be monitored. </p><p>  I can confirm that the delay in processing applications does not result in any saving to the Department. If an application is awarded the payment is backdated to the date the application was made and all arrears due are issued. </p></reply>

However, the Pensions Act was amended in 2009 to provide that where a scheme was considering a restructure of scheme benefits, it could decide to discontinue increases in payment to current pensioners. </p><p>  The revaluation of preserved benefits for former scheme members is provided for in the Pension Act 1990.  The Act prescribes that the percentage of increases applied shall be the lesser of the increase in the general level of consumer prices during that year or 4 per cent.  While there was an increase of 2.6 per cent in the revaluation of preserved benefits for 2011, this was the first increase in preserved benefits in 3 years. </p><p>  The revaluation rate applied to preserved benefits has for most of the last decade lagged behind the rate of change in the average industrial wage.  This position has now been reversed.  The increase in the average industrial wage in 2011 was 1.4%.</p><p>  The operation of the Pension Act is monitored on an on-going basis and while there are no proposals at the moment to amend the revaluation provision in the Pensions Act the matter will be kept under review.</p></reply>

The article raised a number of interesting points particularly around the issues of job creation and the interaction of the employment and welfare spheres. </p><p><br />  The article discusses whether people on the Live Register have a financial incentive to work given the level of wages available in the economy and the level of social welfare payments made to people on the Register.  In this regard it should be noted that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the register each year.  Indeed, for many unemployed people, unemployment is a short-term experience and the author of the article acknowledges that jobseeker&#8217;s supports have an important role to play in supporting people through periods of involuntary unemployment. </p><p><br />  The issue of welfare dependency is also addressed in the article.  In this area my Department is engaging with jobseekers in order to support them and their families in progressing into employment.  One of the key concepts underpinning pathways to work and the new national employment and entitlements service is the relationship between the jobseeker and the Department.  In accepting payment of benefit and support, the jobseeker shall agree to avail of the appropriate support measures offered during the course of the activation process, whether this is employment, education, training or placement in employment schemes.</p><p><br />  With regard to the suggestion in the article that the Government should provide a database on which employers could, on a free of charge basis, advertise vacancies, the Department already provides such a service at .  Each year approximately 70,000 vacant positions are published on this site.  The site also allows jobseekers to upload their CVs onto the database and employers can then match their job requirements against the profile of the candidate CVs.  </p><p><br />  Internships of the type suggested in the article are available under the jobbridge scheme which is also managed via this computer system.  The Department is currently considering how it can improve this service.</p><p><br />  Latterly, the article proposes consideration of replacing jobseeker&#8217;s allowance with a compulsory work system.  While the establishment of such a system would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the first instance, I would note that there could be significant potential for such a system to interfere with the functioning of the labour market, for example through substitution of existing work.  In addition, it is difficult to see how any such system could be implemented without imposing very substantial additional costs on the Exchequer.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  In order to ensure that the processes, facilities and ICT systems worked in practice, the SAFE registration process was successfully piloted in three DSP Local Offices (Tullamore, Dublin Kings Inn and Sligo).  The pilot also aimed to establish the resources needed to roll-out SAFE/PSC registration nationally.  It also indicated the need for legislative changes to support the new processes and some of these were included in this year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Act.</p><p>  The pilot has been completed and a roll-out of SAFE/PSC registration centres nationally is now in progress.  SAFE/PSC registration is currently being extended via the DSP Local Office network, and a number of new dedicated SAFE Centres are being set up initially in Dublin and, over time, in locations nationally.</p></reply>

The &euro;100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including: claimants with a qualified child; those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit; those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied; those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance; certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</p><p>  A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</p><p>  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. </p><p>  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or T&uacute;s, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p><p>  I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials have engaged in constructive dialogue with Focus Ireland with regard to their concerns.  Currently, Focus Ireland is working to supply my Department with details from their network organisations of relevant individual cases.  On receipt of this information, my Department will engage in further discussions with Focus Ireland.  These discussions will seek to achieve a satisfactory resolution of any issues arising in respect of these persons, while also preserving the integrity of the social welfare system and avoiding any potential drift towards welfare dependency.</p></reply>

However, where persons in receipt of widow&rsquo;s pension were claiming illness benefit prior to the end of January 2012, a maximum overlapping period of 15 months applies.</p><p>  Generally, the social welfare code is a contingency-based system, such contingencies including sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.  While there were some exceptions (including the payment of half-rate illness benefit concurrently with widows contributory pension), there is a general rule that only one social welfare payment is payable at any one time.  This maintains the equity of the social welfare system and is common to social security systems across the world.</p><p>  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current arrangements are not discriminatory.</p></reply>

A person awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately (or within 12 months), provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  </p><p>  A waiting period prior to entitlement is considered essential to enable people to engage in job search and consider options available to them.  The imposition of a waiting period serves to minimise the &ldquo;deadweight&rdquo; element which is the extent to which people would have moved into employment or training and education without access to the scheme.  It is also considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.  </p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to DSP customers, including BTEA, and it is my intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review.</p></reply>

A person wishing to pursue the back to education allowance will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.</p><p>  Progression in education is a condition which is not unique to BTEA, indeed State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one. This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  Furthermore, the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system. </p><p>  My Department is currently reviewing a wide range of activation supports available to DSP customers, including BTEA, and it is my intention to canvass the views of stakeholders as part of the implementation process resulting from the review. </p></reply>

It is designed as a temporary, fixed-term intervention to assist long-term unemployed and other specified disadvantaged groups to re-enter the labour market. The current structure of Community Employment (CE) has had provision for 1-year CE participation pattern under the Part-time Integration Option since 1996. The Pathways to Work policy statement mentions that one third of CE places will be realigned towards shorter more focused labour market interventions. This measure is designed to improve the outcomes for those participants and to increase the throughput on the scheme so more people can benefit from a CE placement, including relevant, tailored training and work experience. </p><p>  All CE participant contracts are for 1 year at a time, even under the 3-year Part-time Job Option (PTJ) where contracts are renewable annually for up to 3 years participation. If a participant is considered &ldquo;job-ready&rdquo; by their CE Supervisor at contract renewal time, they will not have their contract renewed for a further year. CE Sponsors are fully aware of the transient nature of participant employment within the CE programme and must plan and accommodate for this reality. All candidates put forward for CE job interview (by the Department&rsquo;s Employment Services to CE Sponsors) have to be both eligible under the CE entry criteria and suitable for placement on the programme. Where a different programme more closely suits a candidate&rsquo;s needs, they will be directed towards that intervention.</p></reply>

The Deputy should note that the CSP is currently fully committed to the end of 2013.  Depending on the nature of the service to be supported, a community organisation can avail of work placements under a number of programmes to help with the delivery of services at little or no cost to the organisation.  These programme are, JobBridge - the national internship programme, T&uacute;s - the community work placement initiative and community employment.</p></reply>

In January the figure was 4,539. There has been a drop in uptake for OFP clients on CE since the Budget changes in December. This reduction in take-up has been compensated by an increased take-up by persons on Jobseekers Allowance.</p><p>  The Budget changes only affect those commencing CE on or after 16th January 2012. The change means that OFP clients can no longer retain their OFP payment and also simultaneously receive CE allowances. Instead they move to a CE allowance equivalent to their original OFP amount plus a &euro;20 per week CE participation bonus. Those OFP clients already on CE as at 16th   January retain their OFP payment in full and simultaneously receive a standard CE allowance of &euro;208 per week in addition to their OFP amount. Once they exit CE, the double payment ceases. </p><p>  Childcare allowances have never been a feature of Community Employment. Travel expenses are only paid for participants undergoing Department-approved training where travel costs are unavoidable.

The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.</p><p>  The housing policy framework published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning in June 2011 contains the announcement for the transfer of responsibility in providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities.  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  Revised maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into force on 1 January 2012.  The revised rent limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Most claims are reviewed every six months, or when an existing lease expires.  </p><p>  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates department officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes. </p><p>  Statistics are not available as to the number of rent supplement claims cancelled or suspended following review. </p><p>  Approximately 33,500 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing over 37% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the existing rent limits.  </p></reply>

Spouses and relatives who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self-employed contributors who are liable to social insurance contributions.  These contributions enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and receive accruing benefits.</p><p>  Alternatively, where a family  business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses and assisting relatives involved in the business pay  PRSI contributions either as employees or as self-employed contributors depending on whether a contract of service exists.</p><p>  Exceptions to this general rule apply in the case of certain 'Family Employment'.  This term is used to describe a situation in which a self-employed sole trader/businessperson either employs, or is assisted in the running of the business, by a spouse or by other family member(s). The exceptions apply to both men and women in family employments and recognise the practical difficulties in establishing the existence of a genuine employment relationship in such circumstances.  </p><p>  Where formal employment relationships are intended between spouses or assisting relatives, the legislation provides the scope necessary to allow parties  enter into formal arrangements for a contract of employment or self-employment whereby PRSI contributions will be payable.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been made in establishing this new service. However, full implementation across all locations will take a number of years to complete.</p><p>  The first step in establishing the NEES was integrating staff from F&Aacute;S, the Community Welfare Service into the Department.  This was followed by a number of developments including one-stop shop trials in four locations, the development of new service processes, the development of an employer engagement strategy, training to support the changes and the development of a number of important supports and IT projects to help streamline services to customers.  In addition the roll-out of the Public Service Card which is currently underway will greatly facilitate the development of the new integrated service.  </p><p>  The first four locations for the one stop shop trials are King&rsquo;s Inns/Parnell St.(Dublin city centre), Tallaght, Arklow and Sligo, with a further number of locations due to provide the NEES service by the end of the year.  As part of the new service, clients receive a single decision on their welfare entitlements, are assessed to determine their employment services requirements and, following assessment, attend a group interview with subsequent one-to-one interviews. The number and frequency of one to one interviews is designed to meet the jobseeker&rsquo;s particular requirements. Clients who do not engage with the process are placed on a penalty rate of payment.</p><p>  While the new service is currently been trialled and implemented in four locations, it is envisaged that following these trials a considerable number of offices will begin to deliver the new service. In addition, where practicable, elements of the new integrated service will be implemented more widely in offices throughout the country. </p></reply>

The objective is to ensure that Ireland&#8217;s greatest resource, its people, will no longer remain on the Live Register for lengthy periods without an appropriate offer of assistance from the State.  To achieve this objective the Government has committed itself to a range of ambitious targets. Two of the most important commitments are:  My Department will engage with each person who becomes unemployed in the future with a view to reducing the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months today to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.  In addition working with the Department of Education and Skills we will provide in excess of 542,000 places on job placement/work experience and training and education in 2012. </p><p>These are significant commitments at a time of reduced resources and reflect the importance placed by this Government on labour market activation measures. However, I am conscious of the particular problems relating to youth unemployment and the need to secure cross departmental involvement in the development of appropriate policy responses.<i> Pathways</i>  facilitates such cross departmental co-operation and the effectiveness of the measures announced is being monitored on a quarterly basis. </p><p><br />  With particular reference to the suggestion of a youth guarantee, there is considerable variation among Member States with regards to the possible implementation of any such guarantee, in terms of the target groups covered and the extent and nature of the policy commitments made.  My Department is reviewing arrangements here in the light of these various approaches.  The European Commission is also reviewing guarantee policies across the Member States with a view to making proposals for a European-wide approach.  These proposals are expected to be published in December.</p></reply>

This is because the Department delivers a wide range of payments at weekly, monthly, annual and other intervals across a range of claim processing systems which support the delivery of entitlements to people under individual social welfare schemes. However, the number of people whose circumstances entitle them to &euro;1,000 per week or more in social welfare payments is very small.</p><p>While the average payment varies across the various schemes operated by the Department, the most typical rate paid to people of working age is &euro;188 per week, while the most typical rate paid to people aged 66 years or more is &euro;230.30 per week.</p><p>In addition to their primary weekly payment, some people may also receive secondary benefits, such as Rent Supplement or Fuel Allowance if they also satisfy the conditions for receipt of those payments. For example, 12% of people on the Live Register also receive Rent Supplement and 16% receive Fuel Allowance. The most typical rate of Rent Supplement is &euro;100 per week, while Fuel Allowance is &euro;20 per week from October to April.</p><p>The majority of people receive a payment for themselves alone. For example, 75% of people on the Live Register receive a personal rate only, the maximum rate of which is &euro;188 per week, and 52% of these receive less than &euro;188 per week. In general, the highest aggregate payments arise in cases where there is a large number of children and rent or mortgage interest supplement is in payment. These are relatively few in number. For example, there are currently 1,063 people in receipt of increases in their Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in respect of 6 or more children. These represent less than one quarter of 1% of the Live Register.</p><p>The following tabular statement sets out the average weekly value of the most common social welfare payments.</p><p>Table:  Average values for weekly social welfare payments, January &ndash; August 2012.</p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Average value    (&#8364;weekly)</th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td><div>247.45</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td><div>242.14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)s Contributory Pension</td><td><div>231.34</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td><div>227.16</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td><div>224.23</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td><div>213.18</div></td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>208.26</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance</td><td><div>201.05</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td><div>202.50</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carer&#8217;s Allowance</td><td><div>187.60</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker&#8217;s Benefit</td><td><div>176.32</div></td></tr></table></p><p><i>Note:</i>   <i>The data presented above is scheme specific and does not take into account the fact that some individual recipients may be in receipt of more than one personal rate of a primary payment e.g. State Pension Contributory and a Half-Rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (over 40% of all Carer&rsquo;s Allowance recipients receive more than one primary personal payment per week).

Therefore a figure of &euro;10,941.00 was deducted from the arrears leaving the person concerned with a net payment of &euro;1,034.50 arrears, which issued on the 16th  of August 2012.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.2161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRWW02300"><p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012.</p><p>  The housing policy framework published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning in June 2011 contains the announcement for the transfer of responsibility in providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities. A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer. The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency. This will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support payment for those temporarily unemployed. </p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p><p>  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications in ensuring that tenants can meet their rental commitments.  However, this is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.</p></reply>

Given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, you will appreciate that savings have to be found in the social welfare system.</p><p><br />  As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this and the changes to State pension have been made in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.</p><p><br />  In addition to the budgetary imperative, there is an important long-term policy context for the proposed changes to State pension, which includes gradually increasing the State pension age to 68 years and introducing changes to the pension rate bands for customers who reach pension age on and from September 2012.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.</p><p><br />  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.</p><p><br />  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.  The standardisation of State pension age to age 66 is one of the measures planned which aims to increase the sustainability of the Irish pension system.</p><p><br />  It is important in assessing any rates of payment, that we focus on the real impact of social welfare payments. In this regard, it should be noted that older people do not experience the levels of poverty that existed in the past. This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &#8216;risk of poverty&#8217; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%. If one examines deprivation rates from a gender perspective, it can be seen that in 2009, the deprivation rate of older men at 7.6% was lower than the deprivation rate of older women at 11.1%.  However, in 2010 this pattern has reversed and the data now shows us that older women suffer lower rates of deprivation at 6.9% compared to 11.8% for older men.</p><p><br />  The State pension is a very valuable benefit. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.</p><p><br />  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the contribution made ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  The sustainability of pensions into the future is also important given the changing demographics, the increased numbers of those over 65 and increased longevity and reduced dependency ratio.</p><p><br />  In relation to women who leave the workplace for homemaking/caring purposes, they can, if eligible, avail of the homemakers scheme which helps to provide a higher rate of pension for those who meet the qualifying conditions.</p><p><br />  It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by the rate band change may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund shows that those with short contribution histories have the potential to fare better than those with full contribution histories. This is particularly helpful to women.  The Fund also provides better value to women than to men.</p><p><br />  An information campaign in relation to all of the changes to State pension has been underway since March 2012 and all information can be accessed at .  My Department met with the relevant representative groups and information leaflets were disseminated to all relevant groups as part of the information campaign.</p></reply>

The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims, currently an average of 28 weeks, is not satisfactory, but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p><p>  Carer's allowance section has recently completed a major service delivery modernisation project to improve the efficiency with which it processes applications from clients for carer's allowance. The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two steams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processed these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its outcome.

There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &#8364;436 million for 2012.</p><p><br />  At the time of application for a rent supplement, the claimant must:  have been residing in private rented accommodation (where at the commencement of the tenancy the person could have reasonably afforded the rent and has experienced a substantial change in his or her circumstances where they are now unable to pay the rent) or accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement, <b>or</b> have an assessment of housing need carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and have been deemed to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</p><p><br />  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement will be referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. There has been no recent change to these eligibility criteria.</p><p><br />  The timescale for determining applications is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p><p><br />  The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department&#8217;s staff dealing with applications for rent supplement.  However, this is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner. I am satisfied that the Department&#8217;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications make every effort to ensure claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p></reply>

This change had been provided for in legislation since 1997 and has featured in all of my Department&#8217;s relevant communications, information leaflets, booklets and on the Department&#8217;s  website since then.  Officials of my Department held meetings in January with the customer groups representing older people to outline the changes to State pension (contributory/transition) that were being introduced this year including the increase in the minimum contribution requirement.  Feedback was sought from these groups and included in an information pack that was prepared to further publicise the changes to the scheme.</p><p><br />  The finalised information pack was published in early March on the Department&#8217;s website,    and on twitter and was made available through the Citizens Information Board website www.citizensinformation.ie. It was widely circulated to customer representative groups including those representing older people, working age groups, farming groups, trade unions, employer groups, accountancy bodies etc. It was also forwarded to all members of the Oireachtas.

The change introducing an increase in the minimum number of paid contributions was provided for in legislation in 1997. The first part of this measure, which increased the minimum qualifying contributions for State pension contributory from 156 to 260, was implemented by a previous government in 2002.  The second part, increasing the minimum number of qualifying contributions from 260 to 520 was introduced in April 2012.   Those affected from April 2012 amount to an estimated 1,200 people per annum, who will not now qualify for a State pension (contributory), but may have an entitlement to a means-tested State pension (non-contributory).</p><p>  These changes reflect the comprehensive coverage of the social insurance system and take into consideration the fact that the State pension is a very valuable benefit.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.</p><p>  Recent changes to State pension supports the direct link between contributions made and the rate of pension received which underpins State pension policy.  This ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.  This has been the policy of successive governments since the relevant legislation was first enacted in 1997.  The sustainability of pensions into the future is also important given the changing demographics, the increased numbers of those over 65 and increased longevity and reduced dependency ratio.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  </p><p>  As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this and the changes to State pension have been made in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. </p></reply>

This can be clearly seen in a wide range of data such as the significant reduction in the &lsquo;risk of poverty&rsquo; rate from 27.1% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2010. The consistent poverty rate over the same period also declined from 3.9% to 0.9%. If one examines deprivation rates from a gender perspective, it can be seen that in 2009, the deprivation rate of older men at 7.6% was lower than the deprivation rate of older women at 11.1%.  However, in 2010 this pattern has reversed and the data now shows us that older women suffer lower rates of deprivation at 6.9% compared to 11.8% for older men.  Women who do not qualify for a pension or are affected by other changes to State pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.  A State pension non-contributory, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.</p><p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund shows that, notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with short contribution histories can fare better than those with full contribution histories, which is of particular importance to women. The report also shows that the Fund provides better value to female than to male contributors.  </p></reply>

At the end of July, over &euro;400m in control savings were reported and over 650,000 reviews had been carried out.  I fully expect that my Department will achieve the 2012 control targets.  It is important to remember that control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure from control activity over a future period.  Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  These activities also have a deterrent or knock-on effect, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities. </p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion in respect of some 1.15 million children.   The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.</p><p>  I have no plans to implement means-testing of child benefit at this time.  However, if the Government decided in principle to progress on these lines, there are many issues that would have to be addressed. These would include not only issues about what factors to take into account but also broader policy, legislative and administrative issues. These would include ensuring that systems are in place to ensure that households only claimed benefits to which they were entitled, as the scale of means testing approximately 600,000 families would be significantly greater than anything required by the current social protection system in terms of means tested payment.</p><p>  Nonetheless, I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p></reply>

In addition, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman (which does not have a board) comes under the remit of the Department<i>.</i>  When filling vacancies on the boards of these bodies, every effort is made to comply with the target of having at least 40% of each gender represented on a board.</p><p><br />  The relevant legislative provisions governing the membership of the Citizens Information Board require that not less than 6 of the 15 members must be female, while not less than 6 must be male.  This is 40% in each case. 42% of the current Citizens Information Board members are female, with three vacancies due to be filled.</p><p><br />  While members of the Pensions Board are appointed by the Minister for Social Protection, there is also a requirement that the members appointed must be representative of various interests involved.  For instance, appointments to the Pensions Board are subject to the conditions set out in Section 9 and the First Schedule of the Pensions Act 1990.  These conditions specify that all members of the Board are appointed by the Minister for Social Protection under the provisions of the Act and must comprise representatives of trade unions, employers, consumer interests, pensioner interests, the Government, the pensions industry, member trustees and professional groups involved with pension arrangements.  Within this selection process due regard has been paid to date to ensure that the target of 40% female representation on the Pensions Board is met.  Currently, the gender breakdown of serving members on the Pensions Board is 47% female and 53% male.</p><p><br />  The Social Welfare Tribunal deals with cases where entitlement to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance is refused due to an involvement in a trade dispute and where claimants feel that they have been unreasonably deprived of employment because their employer has refused or failed to follow the negotiating machinery available for settling disputes.  The Tribunal comprises a chairperson and four ordinary members who are representative of employees and employers.  Accordingly, two of the members are nominated by ICTU and the other two members are nominated by IBEC.</p><p><br />  When seeking nominations for the ordinary members of the Tribunal from both ICTU and IBEC every effort is made to ensure that the nominations adhere to the Government's gender balance policy.  The current Tribunal has one female member (20%).</p></reply>

Medical certifiers, who are in the main general practitioners or hospital doctors, enter into a contract with the Department that requires them to medically examine persons claiming illness or injury benefit and to certify as accurately as possible the specific disease or ailment that renders a person incapable of work.  The contract requires them to refuse to issue a medical certificate if the person&rsquo;s condition does not justify it.  The terms of the GPs&rsquo; contract with the Department specifies that if a medical certifier fails to abide by the terms of the agreement, financial penalties may be applied, including termination of contract.</p><p>  Medical evidence submitted in support of a claim, based on GP certification, is systematically reviewed by medical assessors within the Department.  In all cases of incapacity, there is scope for individual medical interpretation based on the certifier's perception of the nature of the incapacity and the type of work the person is involved in.  Thus, when a case is reviewed by the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors, who are independent and impartial in their assessments, they may express a different opinion to that of the certifier.  When conducting an assessment, the Medical Assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather s/he assesses the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities resulting from the disease or injury, affects the person&rsquo;s ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.</p><p>  However, if it were to emerge that a disproportionate number of customers certified by any particular certifier were found capable of work by Medical Assessors, this would be investigated.  No such unusual pattern of certification has come to attention to date.</p></reply>

This programme of work, which is known as the Standard Authentication Framework Environment or SAFE for short, also provided for the introduction of a Public Services Card (PSC) to enable individuals to gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department.</p><p>  The roll-out of the SAFE registration functionality on a national basis began in June this year.  The creation of a SAFE registration environment in a local office involves improving the technical connectivity, installing new equipment and training staff in these offices to support the registration process.  To date, this process has been completed in 30 local offices and a total of approximately 25,000 PSC&rsquo;s have been issued through these locations.</p><p>  Work is continuing on developing the required bandwidth, installing the appropriate equipment and training staff across the remainder of the Departments local office network.  In addition, a number of dedicated public service card registration centres are being progressed and will start to come on stream over the coming months.</p><p>  In the meantime, production continues to ramp up across the offices where registration is operational and it is expected that the target of approx 100,000 face to face registrations will be achieved through this channel by the end of the year.  The majority of cards issued to date have been issued to new claimants for Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance and applicants for a new PPS number in Local Offices that have been equipped to carry out SAFE registrations.</p><p>  In addition to the above, a pilot for a reduced registration process using information already available has commenced and the Department has engaged with over 4,000 pensioners as part of this pilot with a view to testing and validating this reduced process.  Subject to the outcome of this pilot, the Department will be introducing new registration methods which will allow for commencement of rollout of the card to customers for whom a reduced process is appropriate.  With the range of registrations processes available, the numbers of PSC to be produced from 2013 onwards will be significantly increased.</p></reply>

The rollout of the Public Services Card has recently commenced and SAFE registration facilities are currently being implemented across the Department.  To date, SAFE registration stations have been installed in 29 offices nationally.  The details are set out in the tabular sheet attached.  Some 25,000 PSCs have been issued to clients of the Department, mostly jobseeker clients who are the first cohort of DSP customers to use the PSC.</p><p>The registration process is being built into the standard claim taking process for a number of schemes and in addition, some clients with existing claims are being invited to register.  Over time, client groups for SAFE registration will be expanded to encompass all DSP scheme clients, clients of other public sector organisations, and across the general population of Ireland.  The establishment of client identity has always been a vital part of the Department&rsquo;s claim processes and any issues that arise in relation to identity are fully investigated in establishing entitlement to social welfare services.</p><p>While figures on the number of SAFE registrations directly linked with incidences of fraudulent claiming are not readily available to date, it is important to point out that considerable emphasis is being placed on the introduction of the card as a strategic fraud prevention and detection tool.  There are a number of areas where fraud prevention and detection will be enhanced through PSC roll-out and these are set out below:</p><p>Identity fraud:  Combating and preventing the use of dual or multiple identities to fraudulently claim social welfare payments;  preventing the use of a false or duplicate identity to engage in concurrent working and claiming; payment Instrument:  preventing and assisting in detecting identity fraud or false encashment at post offices.</p><p>Non-residency: preventing and detecting incidences of non-residency from the State. The card will be a more secure payment token than existing Social Services Card and for Post Office payments, it will help mitigate this problem.</p><p><table><tr><th>For Written PQ 39211-112 18 Sept 2012</th><th><div>DSP Region</div></th></tr><tr><td>King's Inn Street Local Office</td><td>Dublin Central</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore PPSN</td><td>Midlands South</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo PPSN</td><td>North West</td></tr><tr><td>Arklow Local Office</td><td>Mid Leinster</td></tr><tr><td>Kings Inn Street PPSN</td><td>Dublin Central</td></tr><tr><td>Coolock Local Office</td><td>Dublin North</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Local Office</td><td>Dublin South</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot Local Office</td><td>Dublin South</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas LO</td><td>Dublin North</td></tr><tr><td>Navan Road LO</td><td>Dublin North</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymun Local Office</td><td>Dublin North</td></tr><tr><td>Bishop Square LO</td><td>Dublin Central</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny PPSN</td><td>Midlands South</td></tr><tr><td>Killarney Local Office</td><td>South West</td></tr><tr><td>Newcastlewest Local Office</td><td>Mid West</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis PPSN</td><td>Mid West</td></tr><tr><td>Buncrana LO</td><td>North West</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny PPSN</td><td>North West</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny PSC Centre (Decentralised Office) *</td><td>North West</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone PPSN</td><td>Midlands North</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar PPSN</td><td>Western</td></tr><tr><td>Gandon House PSC Centre (pilot)</td><td>Dublin Central</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee PPSN</td><td>South West</td></tr><tr><td>Longford PPSN</td><td>Midlands North</td></tr><tr><td>Clonmel PPSN</td><td>Midlands South</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk PPSN</td><td>North East</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford Local Office</td><td>South East</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford PPSN</td><td>South East</td></tr><tr><td>Carrick-on-Shannon Local Office</td><td>North West</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Selection is by a randomised process undertaken by my Department.  The number of persons to be contacted is agreed at a local level between officials and staff of the implementation body based on the available work placements and future vacancies.  Those agreeing to participate have their details forwarded to one of the 51 implementation bodies contracted to deliver T&uacute;s locally.  Where a person responds and states that s/he is not willing to participate, the local office will examine the reasons, if any, outlined and determine whether the explanations provided are reasonable and provide grounds for a person to be excused or moved to a more appropriate social protection payment.  Where information is not forthcoming or the person is uncooperative, a disqualification for failing or neglecting to avail of a reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment can be applied as set out in Section 147(4)(d) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act) 2005.</p><p>  In making his or her decision, a Department official must have regard to the personal and family circumstances of the person.  A decision to disqualify can arise where the person invited does not respond, responds negatively or does not attend an interview without good cause.  These reasons are wide ranging but mostly relate to non-delivery of invitation due to change of address, absence from the address, inability to work due to physical or mental illness, under medical care/injured, hospitalisation, attendance at a recognised training and/or educational course, engaged in another work placement, imminent birth of a child, plans to emigrate and caring obligations.</p><p>  My Department is in the process of collating data on the first 12 months of the operation of T&uacute;s and is not yet in a position to provide precise numbers until this process is completed and the data verified.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently over 90,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million for 2012. </p><p>  It is my intention to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities. This will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer. The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  Policy in relation to social housing provision is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>  For all counties, major urban population centres were tested as part of the rents limit review. The maximum rent limits are based on an analysis of rental rates rather than house prices or regional loan values. Approximately 33,500 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing over 37% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the current rent limits.  </p><p>  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes. </p><p>  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p></reply>

The Working Group recommended a three phased approach to the provision of information and advice to assist people in mortgage distress. The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two phases, the development of a website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, address the provision of information.</p><p><br />  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders at the point where a lender presents a borrower with long term forbearance proposals relating to a mortgage secured on the borrower&#8217;s primary residence.</p><p><br />  At that point, the lender will advise the borrower to take independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of the option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 (plus VAT where applicable) to an accountant for the provision of specified independent financial advice directly to the borrower.  </p><p><br />  The specified advice will be provided by a panel of participating accountants, from the main accountancy bodies. The accountancy bodies have already notified their members about the new service with a view to having the panel in place before the end of September. It is expected that there could be in the region of 1,000 accountants participating in the service.</p><p><br />  The panel will be available on a county by county basis and the details will be available on the Citizens Information Board website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

The Tribunal deals with entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance in cases where a claim is refused because it is considered to be connected to a trade dispute.  For that reason, the Tribunal is made up of individuals deemed to be representative of employers and employees, nominated by ICTU and IBEC, and accordingly vacancies are not advertised. One of the ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and on the nomination of ICTU, a replacement member, Ms. Chris Rowland, was appointed commencing 24 October 2011. </p></reply>

This draft document was presented to the Peatlands Council and the European Commission, and, following this consultation, feedback has now been incorporated into the proposed approach. The document is available on my Department&#8217;s website at </p><p><br />  The proposals made earlier this year at the Peatlands Forum identified relocation as a viable proposition for the majority of our raised bog SACs and the primary focus of the national plan is to develop a long-term conservation approach to each of the sites and relocation options for those who wish to continue turf-cutting.</p><p><br />  While the plan holds out the possibility of finding solutions for even the most difficult of cases, it must be comprehensive and address each of the 53 sites. Its completion is, therefore, dependent on the engagement of turf-cutters on each of the SACs where turf-cutting has been undertaken in recent years. </p><p><br />  When the European Commission and the Government agreed to a National SAC Management Plan approach in April this year, I urged at that time that, for the plan to be a success and to ensure that there was space to concentrate on those bogs where finding alternative solutions was particularly difficult, all those with an interest in the plan&#8217;s success should ensure that cutting would not take place this year. However, the breaches that have occurred on a minority of the SAC raised bogs of the requirement not to cut turf have diverted limited resources into enforcement activities and added additional complexity to the process of completing the plan.</p><p><br />  Nonetheless, I am determined that, in collaboration with the Peatlands Council, substantial progress will be made on the plan over the coming year. In this regard, my Department will now be stepping up contact with turf-cutting groups to seek long-term resolutions to the issues for their particular bogs, in compliance with EU and national law. In addition, my Department will shortly be seeking tenders for the carrying out the scientific research work which is essential to underpin the plan.</p></reply>

The scheme was administered by the local authorities and operated on an annual basis, subject to Exchequer funding being available. It was a matter for each local authority to assess and prioritise applications under the scheme.</p><p><br />  In 2010 my Department provided &#8364;185,500 in funding to Limerick County Council under the <i>Local Authority Conservation Grants Scheme</i>  .

The extension of such a derogation, or the continuation of turf extraction from these sites outside the legal requirements of the Habitats Directive, has been clearly ruled out by the Commission, most recently in Environment Commissioner Poto&#269;nik&#8217;s response in July to European Parliamentary Questions (P-006637/2012) put down by Ms Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness, MEP, regarding certain proposals made by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association (TCCA). In his response, the Commissioner stated: <i>&#8220;Further turf cutting can only legally take place if the requirements of Articles 6(3) and (4) of Directive 92/43/EEC are fully satisfied&#8221;.</i> He also stated:   <i>&quot;The Commission did not give TCCA, or any other party, reason to believe that such continued extraction was possible. Moreover, the Commission does not believe that the Irish authorities have the legal discretion to agree to it either.&quot;</i></p><p><br />  In April of this year, the Government, in discussions with Commissioner Poto&#269;nik, succeeded in securing agreement on an approach to the preparation of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan. The approach has also been considered by the Peatlands Council and is outlined in a document available on my Department&#8217;s website at   . The Commission also made clear, in its reply referred to above, that continued peat extraction on Ireland's 53 raised bog Sites of Community Importance while a national management plan is being prepared would be contrary to the provisions of the applicable EU legislation. My Department will continue to work closely with the Commission in relation to the preparation of this plan.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible at this stage to outline projected savings for each State body to be rationalised until final decisions have been made.</p><p><b>TABLE: Bodies Funded from the Vote Group of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Body</font></b></div></th><th><div><b><font face="Times New Roman">Website Address</font></b></div></th></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Waterways Ireland</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">An Foras Teanga, which comprises:</font></div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">-Foras na Gaeilge</font></div></td><td><div><br /></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">-Tha Boord o Ulst&egrave;r-Scotch/The Ulster-Scots Agency</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Arts Council</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">National Archives</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Irish Manuscripts Commission</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">National Museum of Ireland</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA)</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">National Gallery of Ireland</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Crawford Gallery</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">National Concert Hall</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">National Library of Ireland</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Chester Beatty Library</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Irish Film Board</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div><font face="Times New Roman">Heritage Council</font></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The current <i>Programme for Government</i>   includes an undertaking to review the situation with regard to NHAs and the future of turf-cutting on such sites will be considered as part of that review.  It is intended that the review will be completed prior to the commencement of the 2014 turf-cutting season. The outcomes of the review and the proposed approach to the future of turf-cutting within these sites will be discussed as part of the Government&#8217;s ongoing dialogue with the European Commission regarding compliance with EU law in this area. </p></reply>

In the light of the issues which have arisen in relation to the voluntary bog purchase scheme, I decided that applicants could, if they wished, transfer instead to the compensation scheme established by my Department for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation.

It may be noted that, in a number of these boards, appointments may be other than by way of Government or Ministerial appointment.  For example, appointments may be on foot of nominations by other bodies, or by way of elections, or on an <i>ex officio</i> basis. Clearly, such circumstances can have an influence on the gender balance of the boards in question.</p><p>My Department was established on 2 June 2011 and, accordingly, it is not feasible to provide details of board membership for each of the bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group in each of the past ten years.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.2522.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WREEE00800"><p>I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated parts of the market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  Prices in the retail electricity market are now fully deregulated and since 1 October 2011 gas residential consumers are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are regulated.  Prices in the electricity market and the unregulated segments of the gas market are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers.  Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a serious competitiveness issue facing business energy consumers during this difficult period for the economy.  The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy and is a challenge we are determined to meet. At a national level, competitive markets in electricity and gas help put downward pressure on prices noting that global fossil fuel prices are a key determinant of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity costs.  Energy suppliers compete with each other for market share by offering a variety of prices and products to consumers who may then choose the most advantageous offering.</p><p>  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  There are indications that international gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The deterioration in the Euro/Sterling exchange rate is also impacting on gas prices in the Eurozone. These trends are leading to higher domestic electricity and gas prices, as reflected by recent increases in domestic electricity prices announced by the suppliers competing in that market and by CER&rsquo;s decision to allow an increase in BGE&rsquo;s regulated gas tariff for the residential sector.</p><p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s heavy reliance on imported gas and relatively small market size the economy is therefore vulnerable to fossil fuel price fluctuations and price rises.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices must be that we retain or improve our competitive position. While Ireland is a price taker for imported fossil fuels, focus must also be maintained on actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, employment and for economic recovery.</p><p>  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible, including sustained focus on energy efficiency measures.  The upward trend in energy prices reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels. In particular, it is vital that SMEs as well as Large Energy Users engage with energy efficiency measures which deliver cost savings and support competitiveness and jobs.  I would urge all businesses to engage with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to access the Authority&rsquo;s energy efficiency support programmes.</p><p>  The Better Energy programme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, as well as bringing on board energy suppliers as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers. Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity.</p></reply>

The State only intervenes in market failure situations where licensed service providers have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  Following the conclusion of a technology neutral procurement process, my Department entered into a contract with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as &ldquo;3&rdquo;) in late December 2008 for the delivery of the NBS.  The total cost to the Exchequer is some &euro;80m of which an estimated &euro;36m will be recouped from the EU. </p><p>  Broadband services are available from &ldquo;3&rdquo;, the NBS service provider, in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme since October 2010.  As regards the area of Carrigallen in Co Leitrim referred to by the Deputy, the EDs of Carrigallen East and Carrigallen West are covered under the Scheme.  In keeping with State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic, affordable product.  The NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6Mbps download and 1.2Mbps upload, subject to a maximum contention ratio.  These speeds will be upgraded in October 2012 to 2.3mbps and 1.4mbps respectively at no cost to NBS customers.</p><p>  The NBS satellite service, deployed in a limited number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, has recently been enhanced following a competitive tendering process undertaken by 3.  The new satellite service, provided by Digiweb, offers speeds of 3.6Mbps download and 384kbps upload, subject to a maximum contention ratio.</p><p>  As regards service quality, the Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  Where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  Any NBS customer who is experiencing problems with the NBS service can contact 3&rsquo;s customer care centre 24 hours a day 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge) or by email to nbssupport@three.ie.  Additionally, a team of field engineers has been established to address NBS specific service issues at customers&rsquo; premises.  My Department has a role when customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and still feel that their complaint has not been resolved.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie   with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.</p><p>  With basic broadband services available throughout Ireland, the challenge now  is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government&rsquo;s recently published National Broadband Plan entitled &ldquo;Delivering a Connected Society &ndash; A National Broadband Plan for Ireland&rdquo; aims to facilitate the provision of high speed broadband to every home and business in the State over the lifetime of the Government. </p><p>  The plan has the following headline targets:  	</p><p>70Mbps - 100Mbps to more than half of the population by 2015; </p><p>At least 40Mbps, and in many cases much faster speeds, to at least a further 20% of the population and potentially as much as 35% around smaller towns and villages; and</p><p>A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country &ndash; no matter how rural or remote. </p><p>  As a first step in this plan, my Department will engage with the commercial service providers to identify those parts of the country which the commercial market will serve.  This task will be essential to avoid displacing investments already made and being planned by the commercial service providers.  The exercise is also required in order to meet EU Commission State Aid requirements.</p><p>  Thereafter a public procurement will be announced to provide minimum levels of high speed broadband services across the country.</p></reply>

The Government has also reiterated its commitment to retaining the electricity and gas networks as well as the two gas interconnectors in State ownership as national strategic infrastructure, critical for the delivery of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies. </p><p>  ESB will remain a vertically integrated utility, positioned more competitively in the all island energy market and in due course in the integrated European Market.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy will support this dynamic, successful company and its employees to continue to invest and grow while enhancing competition in the energy market for the benefit of the economy and consumers.  Significant progress has been made in implementing the asset disposal programme, in line with our commitments under the EU/ECB/IMF Funding Programme.</p><p> Tender processes for the appointment of financial advisors to oversee the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy are underway.

The most recent tracking study was carried out in August 2012.  The findings show that 93% of Irish people are now aware of the Digital TV Switchover.  In rural areas 96% of adults are now aware of the digital television switchover.  Furthermore, 82% of the population are now aware that the analogue television network will be officially switched off in October 2012, compared to 66% in June. </p><p><br />  The research also shows that 12% of homes in the country, approximately 200,000, are still using the analogue TV network for their primary TV.   These households must make the switch to digital TV or they will lose their TV reception on 24 October.  Households who only use pay TV platforms such as SKY and UPC will not be affected by analogue switch off.  My Department&#8217;s national digital switchover public information campaign rolled out in October 2011 and provides information on what is happening, the timelines and the different choices available to upgrade to digital.  This comprehensive campaign includes advertising on TV, local and national radio; an analogue marker (red x 24 October) to act as a constant reminder to everyone using the analogue service to switch to digital; research; a dedicated website &#8211;     and national telephone helpline; and an information booklet which was delivered to every household in the Country.</p><p><br />  To further assist people make the switch, on Monday 10<sup>th</sup> September I launched National Digital Switchover Week which will run from 17<sup>th</sup> &#8211; 23<sup>rd</sup>   September.  Organised by my Department in partnership with The Wheel and Irish Rural Link, the week will see 26 local Digital Outreach Champions across the country organise events in their communities to encourage those who have not yet switched to digital TV to do so. </p><p><br />  I am confident that, by the switch off date, as a result of the national information campaign, the delivery nationwide of the digital switchover information booklet, the Outreach Programme and National Digital Switchover Week, everyone will be fully aware that the analogue network is closing down on 24<sup>th</sup> October 2012 and of their switchover options.  As there are only 36 days to go before the 24 October deadline, I would urge all Deputies to engage with the Outreach Programme and Digital Switchover Week at a local level in order to urge constituents to move to digital now and not to wait until the last minute.  </p></reply>

On 11 May 2012, the EPA published its preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction in the form of a small desk based study, which was carried out by the University of Aberdeen.</p><p>  The study provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research such as geological principles of relevance in fracking and shale gas extraction, potential environmental impacts and establishing best environmental practice.  While the study is a preliminary study it will inform the development of the terms of reference for a much more detailed research study to be commissioned by the EPA later this year.  The terms of reference for this more extensive research are currently being drawn up by a steering group including representatives from the EPA and my Department.</p><p>  The outcome of the further research to be commissioned by the EPA will assist in a robust scientific based assessment of any future application proposing the use of this technology.  I have no plans to publish either a green or white paper on a report that has yet to be commissioned by the EPA.  I can confirm, however, that until there has been time to consider the second stage of the EPA research, the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling will not be authorised.  </p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned. Business and domestic customers can now avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.</p><p>With regard to gas, up until 1 October 2011 the CER has regulated the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers but price regulation for the latter group ended at that point.  The CER still regulates the Bord G&aacute;is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  I have no function in the matter.  The timing for complete deregulation of the residential segment of the gas market, as has taken place in the electricity market, is an issue under active review by the CER.  Full deregulation leading to further competition will keep downward pressure on prices for consumers. Ireland is however a price taker for gas.</p><p>In regard to the most recent decision by the CER to apply an increase of 8.5% with effect from 1 October next, I understand that a marginal increase in wholesale international (sterling denominated) gas prices did not impact on the increase as much as the deterioration in the Euro/Sterling exchange rate and the increase in gas network tariffs.  The upward pressure on gas network tariffs is primarily due to a reduction in gas demand and higher financing costs for Bord G&aacute;is Networks, both of which are related to the financial situation in Ireland and abroad.  Currency exchange trends will continue to have a significant impact, either positive or negative, on gas prices for Ireland.  In making its decision, the CER takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by BGE.</p><p>The information requested in relation to CER gas tariff decisions and on the cumulative rise since 2010, is set out in the table.</p><p><b>CER Decisions on BGE tariffs for residential and smaller industrial and commercial customers</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Period (includes CER Decisions following Interim Reviews)</th><th>Average %         Increase/Decrease</th></tr><tr><td>1 October 2012 &#8211; 30 September 2013</td><td>+8.5%</td></tr><tr><td>1 October 2011 &#8211; 30 September 2012</td><td>+21.7%</td></tr><tr><td>1 February 2011 &#8211; 30 September 2011</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>1 October 2010 &#8211; 31 January 2011</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>1 February 2010 &#8211; 30 September 2010</td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Oct 2009 -31 January 2010</td><td>-9.8%</td></tr><tr><td>1 May 2009 &#8211; 30 September 2009</td><td>-12%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Jan 2009 &#8211; 30 April 2009</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Sept 2008 &#8211; 31 December 2008</td><td>+20%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Oct 2007 &#8211; 30 August 2008</td><td>-10.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative increase from January 2010 to date </td><td>+32%</td></tr></table></p><p>The information requested in regard to CER electricity tariff decisions and on the cumulative rise since 2010, is set out in the table.  In view of deregulation, the information is available only up to the time of deregulation (i.e. April 2011).</p><p><b>CER Decisions on regulated Electricity prices &ndash; domestic tariffs up to April 2011</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Period (Includes CER Decisions following Interim Reviews)</th><th>Average % Increase/Decrease</th></tr><tr><td>1 October 2010 &#8211; 4 April  2011</td><td>+4.9%</td></tr><tr><td>1 October 2009 &#8211; 30 September 2010</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>1 May 2009 &#8211; 30 September 2009</td><td>-10%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Jan 2009 &#8211; 30 April 2009</td><td>- 0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Aug 2008 &#8211; 31 December 2008</td><td>+17.5%</td></tr><tr><td>1 Nov 2007 &#8211; 31 July 2008</td><td>-5.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative Increase from January 2010 to April 2011</td><td>+4.9%</td></tr></table></p><p><b>  </b></p><p>Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.</p><p>The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher gas and electricity prices on residential and commercial consumers.  As indicated above, it is regrettably the case that in the main Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of gas and electricity.  My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.</p><p>Accordingly, it is estimated that some &euro;175.8 million will have been spent on the Better Energy programme on energy efficiency measures in 2011 and 2012.  This includes funding for some 195,387 measures in households under the Better Energy: Homes scheme.  Under this programme, &euro;24.5 million was provided under the Better Energy: Warmer Homes Scheme which provides grant assistance for low income families.  In addition the Government is actively supporting the rollout of renewable resources of electricity which has grown from an estimated 9.3% of electricity consumed in 2007 to an estimated 17.6% in 2011.</p><p>There are a number of ways for consumers to take actions on electricity and gas prices, and measures in place to assist them. They can shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers bearing in mind that other suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity and gas usage which delivers demonstrable savings.</p><p>The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Affordability Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.</p><p>Since 2008, comparable EU data on retail electricity and gas prices is published every six months by Eurostat. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) publishes analyses of the Eurostat data twice a year.  This analysis is conducted by the Energy Policy Statistical Support Unit (EPSSU), the specialist statistical unit of SEAI.  For households, electricity and gas prices include all charges payable but do not include initial connection charges.  Prices represent weighted average prices, using the market share of the electricity and gas suppliers surveyed as weighting factors. Market shares are based on the quantity of electricity and gas invoiced by the electricity and gas suppliers to household end-users.</p><p>The latest analysis of data published by Eurostat for electricity and gas prices is published by the SEAI and covers the period July to December 2011. For most domestic electricity customers prices increased by between 10% and 17% in this period. Other European countries also sustained significant prices increases during this period. While residential gas customers also experienced a significant price rise, in the order of 21% for the second half of 2011, residential gas prices remain lower than the European average. Statistics for previous years for the various consumption categories are publically available on the SEAI website:</p><p><i>http://www.seai.ie/Publications/Statistics_Publications/EPSSU_Publications</i></p></reply>

Five working groups were established under the Taskforce to consider issues such as appropriate targets for broadband speed; demand stimulation; the removal of barriers which are currently perceived as hampering investment, spectrum policy and the role of State entities in providing access to infrastructure and services.  The report of the Task Force was published in May 2012 and includes the reports of the five working groups.  The findings of the report, along with the outcome of a public consultation were considered in the development of a National Broadband Plan for Ireland which I Published in August this year.  The NGBT operated on a voluntary basis. The cost associated with hosting the meetings and the publication of the report was &euro;3,675.14.</p><p>  I established the Oil Emergency Planning Task Force (OEPTF) in September 2011, with membership drawn from my Department, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association (IPIA) and the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA).  The purpose of the OEPTF is to develop and refine existing national oil supply disruption contingency plans. This has not resulted in additional costs.</p><p>  An Advisory Group was set up in February 2011 to address matters relating to the digital switchover which will take place in October 2012.  No additional costs have been incurred from establishment of this group. </p><p>  The Corrib Consent Conditions Committee was set up to monitor the implementation of the conditions attaching to Ministerial consent to the construction of the Corrib pipeline.  All costs are recoupable from the developer.</p><p>  A steering group was set up in September 2012 to carry out a Value for Money Policy Review on the proposed Public Service Broadcasting Charge.  Additional costs include the independent chairman&rsquo;s fee of &euro;1,200 which is an all inclusive to cover all meetings and any other work that may arise from the VFM Review.  </p><p>  Two Project Groups were set up in March 2012 to examine the potential merger of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and ComReg and the potential merger of Digital Hub Development Agency /Enterprise Ireland &ndash; IDA respectively. No additional costs were involved and both have now completed this work.</p><p>  While no bodies have been abolished or merged by my Department in 2011 or to date in 2012, my Department has reviewed the rationalisation proposals for Agencies under its aegis as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan and the issue is due for consideration by Government.  I would also mention that in 2010 my Department oversaw the creation of Inland Fisheries Ireland, a single body which replaced the functions of 8 Fisheries Boards, 8 Fisheries cooperatives and the National Salmon Commission.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.2562.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WREEE03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 957 to 959, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The Action Plan on Jobs announced in February of this year is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Under the Action Plan my Department is responsible for a range of measures and policies which will support the objective of promoting sustainable economic growth and fostering employment. Measures attributable to my Department under the Action Plan in many instances will assist the creation of the conditions for employment growth but it is not possible to estimate the precise total number of jobs which emanate from those specific measures.    </p><p>  The Action Plan emphasises the importance of investing in Energy Efficiency Measures which have a positive jobs impact.  In this regard additional funding of &euro;30m was provided under the 2011 Jobs Initiative facilitating total spend of over &euro;91m on the Better Energy Programme, which is operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). This supported the retention of up to 5,700 jobs for 2011 as a whole.  The Government has again committed significant funding of &euro;76 million to the Better Energy programme for 2012, which is projected to deliver 597GWh in energy savings this year and is the equivalent of &euro;34.2 million in the value of energy saved.  The programme will continue to underpin economic activity throughout this year and is supporting the retention of jobs in the retrofitting sector and realising significant energy savings.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan my Department is also facilitating the provision of business supports to promote energy efficiency and reduce cost, including energy audits, energy management training, mentoring and advice.  The Department also facilitates the Accelerated Capital Tax Allowances scheme which supports businesses in purchasing plant and machinery that are highly energy efficient.</p><p>  The Action Plan also commits to developing a Pay As You Save (PAYS) scheme which will allow consumers to finance energy upgrades directly through the energy savings generated.  Roll out will be developed following comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders and will aim to continue supporting jobs in green construction and retrofit.</p><p>  Building on the work of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce and as provided for in the Action Plan on Jobs, I recently announced the National Broadband Plan which will facilitate the provision of high speed broadband to every home and business in the State over the lifetime of the Government.  Investing in high speed communications strengthens Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leading location for foreign direct investment.  It also boosts the export potential of our indigenous companies.</p><p>  Other Action Plan measures include the ongoing investment in the 100Mb/s Schools programme as an enabler for eLearning and enhancing digital skills for school leavers. 200 schools will be completed in 2012, 200 in 2013 and the final 250 in 2014.  This investment will improve the digital skills of future school leavers thereby improving their employability. In addition the Department continues to support digital start up companies through the Digital Hub Development Agency.  There are currently 68 companies based at the Hub employing approximately 817 people. The National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) is also active in the area of digital technology and media, facilitating collaboration between third level institutes and commercial enterprises. NDRC projects and start-ups had attracted &euro;5.565m in private follow-on investment by the end of 2011 with approximately 25 full time corporate staff and 160 temporary researchers working on these projects.</p></reply>

This reimbursement occurs through the travel and subsistence system and the data for the 18 month period in question is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><td><br />February 2011 to August 2012</td><td><div>&#8364;22,537.82</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The total of the two for the 18 month period in question is as follows:</p><p><table><tr><td>February 2011 to August 2012</td><td><div>&#8364;40,073.52</div></td></tr></table></p><p>While there is no specific allocation for taxi use in my Department, it is included in the overall travel budget, expenditure in this area is closely monitored to ensure it stays within expectations.</p><p>The following stipulations apply to the use of taxis:</p><p>Officials travelling within normal walking distance of their office base should not use a taxi service except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Other cheaper forms of public transport should be used when available.</p><p>Taxi should be shared when officials are attending the same meeting.</p><p>Meetings should be held in our buildings and / or video conference facilities used where possible.</p><p>Use of taxis is only permitted for official purposes.</p><p>My Department has also implemented an initiative that makes available a number of bicycles for use by officials in its two Dublin offices during office hours.  Following a successful pilot phase in Adelaide Road, this voluntary initiative was extended to Beggars Bush.  The reaction of staff to the initiative has proved very positive and all eight bicycles are in regular use. This has helped to significantly reduce the cost of taxis to the department since its inception in 2008.  During that year taxi costs were &euro;56,695 in 2009 they were &euro;40,818 and in 2010 &euro;34,678.</p></reply>

Details of the 45 appointments are set out below together with details of the remuneration which may be paid in respect of such appointments.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the One Person One Salary policy introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides that serving public sector employees are not eligible to receive remuneration in relation to their membership of boards of State bodies.  The Deputy will also be aware that non-public sector board members may choose to voluntarily waive their fees as a matter of personal choice in recognition of the current difficult economic circumstances.  Both of these policy initiatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have been brought to the attention of the bodies under the aegis of my Department.  Consequently, the remuneration details in the table below refer to fees that may be payable and are not indicative of fees actually being received by board members.  The payment of board members&rsquo; expenses is an operational matter for each State body.</p><p>In addition since these appointments were made one of the members of the board of SEAI, Michael Conlon, has resigned.</p><p><b>TABLE</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Body</th><th>Appointee</th><th>Fee Band</th></tr><tr><td>An Post</td><td>Mr Donal Connell<br />Mr James Wrynn<br />Mr Paul Henry</td><td>Category 1<br />Chair: &#8364;31,500<br />Director: &#8364;15,750</td></tr><tr><td>Bord na M&oacute;na<br /></td><td>Ms Denise Cronin<br />Mr. John Horgan<br />Ms Elaine Treacy</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>EirGrid<br /></td><td>Dr Gary Healy<br />Ms Regina Moran<br />Mr Liam O&#8217;Halloran<br />Ms Bride Rosney<br />Ms Doireann Barry*</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>ESB</td><td>Ms Noreen Wright<br />Mr Seamus Mallon</td><td>Category 1<br />Chair: &#8364;31,500<br />Director: &#8364;15,750</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC)<br /></td><td>Mr Sean Fitzgerald<br />Mr Vincent Caffrey<br />Ms Aoife MacEvilly<br />Mr Aidan Donnelly</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA)<br /><br /></td><td>Ms Aoife MacEvilly</td><td>Category 4<br />Chair: &#8364;8,978<br />Director: &#8364;5,985</td></tr><tr><td>TG4<br /></td><td>Mr. Miche&aacute;l Seoighe<br />Ms. Mair&#275;ad N&iacute; Cheoin&iacute;n<br />Mr. Joe Connolly<br />Mr. Des Geraghty<br />Ms. Andr&#275;a N&iacute; &#274;alaithe<br />Ms Mairead Nic Suibhne<br />Ms. Michelle N&iacute; Chr&oacute;in&iacute;n<br />Si&uacute;n N&iacute; Raghallaigh</td><td>Category 2<br />Chair: &#8364;21,600<br />Director: &#8364;12,600</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)<br /></td><td>Ms Julie O&#8217;Neill<br />Mr. Edgar Morgenroth<br />Mr. Michael Conlon<br />Ms. Anne Farrell<br />Mr. Declan Waugh<br />Ms. Michelle Green<br />Mr. Brian Carroll</td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA)<br /></td><td>Mr. Paul Holden<br />Mr. Seamus Ratigan</td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr><tr><td>Ordnance Survey Ireland OSI<br /><br /></td><td>Mr. Ronan O&#8217;Reilly <br />Ms. Anne Butler <br />Mr. Robin Simpson<br />Dr. Enda Howley<br /> Dr. Denis Keliher<br />Ms. Marion Coy<br /> Mr. Justin Gleeson<br />Ms Sandra Ryan  <br />Mr. Padraic Jordan<br />Mr. Oliver Hickey </td><td>Category 3<br />Chair: &#8364;11,970<br />Director: &#8364;7,695</td></tr></table></p><p>*No fee applicable</p></reply>

Similarly in relation to meetings and conference costs, refreshments are generally only provided where delegations or external stakeholders are being hosted.</p><p><br />  In 2011 expenditure on official entertainment was &#8364;5,364.  The majority of this amount, &#8364;4,398, was related to the visit of a foreign delegation of 12 from the International Energy Agency involved in conducting a review of Ireland&#8217;s energy policy.  The sum was spent on the provision of meeting facilities, incidentals, tea, coffee and meals for 5 full days and an official dinner.  In addition to the official entertainment costs, approximately &#8364;13,800 from the Department&#8217;s budget for meetings and conferences was spent on refreshments (water, tea, coffee etc).</p><p><br />  So far in 2012 my Department has spent &#8364;836 on official entertainment.  Costs associated with providing refreshments at meetings and conferences have totalled approximately &#8364;6,494 to date.  Given the large volume of meetings, conference and events and the public nature of some of these it is not possible to give a detailed breakdown of what was involved or who was present.  </p></reply>

This includes major projects such as an intensive and nationwide campaign on Digital Switchover, strategic review of oil refining capability, complex telecommunications contracts such as the MANs and the National Broadband Scheme, and oversight of compliance with the Corrib consent conditions (the cost of which is recouped from the developer). In procuring these specialised services, my Department always seeks to ensure value for money and the keeping of expenditure to the minimum necessary.  In this regard, the Deputy might note that expenditure from my Department&rsquo;s consultancy services and value for money and policy reviews budget has reduced from &euro;2.249m in 2008 to &euro;1.372m in 2011.</p><p>The Department also necessarily incurs some expenditure on outsourced services as part of programme expenditure, an element of which is consultancy in nature.

Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation&rsquo;s (ComReg) website at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), services are available to 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) including 112 EDs in County Mayo, which are listed in Appendix I.  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas.</p><p>My Department received 49 eligible applications from County Mayo.  The details of applicants have been passed to the commercial operators participating in the Scheme.  The names of these companies and the area where they operate can be found on the following link:</p><p><i>http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/Communications+Development/Rural+Broadband+Scheme/Participating+Internet+Service+Providers.htm</i>  .</p><p>The companies involved have now sought to provide services to applicants over the period from April to the end of July 2012 and are in the process of providing data to the Department on connections.  Where a commercial service is offered the State cannot intervene.  I await the outcome of this phase of the scheme.</p><p>The question of obtaining a connection directly to an undersea fibre optic cable is not a matter in which I have any function.  It would be a commercial matter to be pursued with the owners and operators of the cables in question and any telecommunications operator who wishes to interconnect with the cable separately.  I can confirm that my Department has sought EU State Aids clearance, to provide new fibre optic cables in ducts owned by the State from Galway to Mayo.  It is expected that this infrastructure will enhance broadband services in the region generally.</p><p>While basic broadband services are available throughout Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government&rsquo;s recently published National Broadband Plan entitled &ldquo;Delivering a Connected Society &ndash; A National Broadband Plan for Ireland&rdquo; aims to facilitate the provision of high speed broadband to every home and business in the State over the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>The plan has the following headline targets:</p><p>70Mbps - 100Mbps to more than half of the population by 2015;</p><p>At least 40Mbps, and in many cases much faster speeds, to at least a further 20% of the population and potentially as much as 35% around smaller towns and villages; and</p><p>A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country &ndash; no matter how rural or remote.</p><p>As a first step in this plan, my Department will engage with the commercial service providers to identify those parts of the country which the commercial market will serve.  This task will be essential to avoid displacing investments already made and being planned by the commercial service providers.  The exercise is also required in order to meet EU Commission State Aid requirements.</p><p>Thereafter a public procurement will be announced to provide minimum levels of high speed broadband services across the country.</p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) Covered by the NBS in County Mayo</b></p><p><table><tr><th>ADDERGOOLE </th><th>ED 157002</th></tr><tr><td>AGHAGOWER NORTH </td><td>ED

Ownership and operation of the electricity distribution network will remain with ESB.  ESB Networks owns the transmission and distribution networks.</p><p>  As part of the State Assets disposal programme, the Government has decided to dispose of some of ESB&rsquo;s non-strategic power generation capacity.  ESB will remain a vertically integrated utility, positioned more competitively in the all island energy market and in due course in the integrated European Market.

While there have been some discoveries of oil off our coasts none have been declared commercial to date.  The only commercial discoveries of gas are the Kinsale area fields which are currently in production and the Corrib gas field which is still in development.</p><p>  The principal direct financial benefit to Ireland from successful exploration comes in the form of the tax paid on profits from petroleum production.  The relevant tax provisions are set down in the Finance Acts and provide for a tax take of between 25% and 40%.  There are no individual financial deals entered into with individual exploration companies.  The tax terms, which were last revised in 2007, seek to strike a balance between the desire to maximise the financial return to the people of Ireland from successful exploration and the need to set the terms at a level that will encourage exploration companies to invest in exploration in the Irish offshore, taking account of the fact that such companies can also instead of investing in other countries which have experienced greater relative success in terms of the number of commercial discoveries made.  </p></reply>

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.  </p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30 Mbps and 40 Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.</p><p>  County level statistics on the percentage of the population which currently has access to broadband speeds in excess of 70 Mbps are not available in my Department.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above.</p><p>  In compliance with EU competition law and State aid rules, the National Broadband Plan does not dictate the technological solution which will be used in the forthcoming public procurement process.  The outcome of the mapping exercise will inform the design of the procurement process and the responses received from the commercial market will determine the technological solution to be used.</p></reply>

The possible introduction of different categories of licence, under Section 144 of the 2009 Act, was considered by my Department in an exercise conducted last year.  An evaluation of the feasibility and cost benefits of such a step was carried out in conjunction with a consultation process, which sought the views of stakeholders who had previously been in contact with the Department in relation to this issue.</p><p>  On foot of this review, the Department decided not to pursue the introduction of different categories of licence at this stage but rather to deal with the issues arising in the context of an ongoing wider review of the current model of television licence fee.  This review, which includes a comprehensive examination of both the effectiveness and efficiency of the current model, is being undertaken on foot of the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a household based Public Broadcasting Charge.  This review, which will also include a period of consultation, will examine the role and collection of the current TV Licence fee, in light of existing and projected convergence of broadcasting technologies, and will include an analysis of the most effective models in terms of efficiency and capability to fund our public service broadcasting service. It is my expectation that the review will also deal with issues relating to equity of applicability, including the approach to be taken to situations as described in the correspondence received by the Deputy. </p><p>  The ultimate objective will be to transform the current TV licence into a Public Service Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device they use to access content.</p></reply>

The necessary assistance and support for everyone but in particular for those households who need to make the switch to digital is being provided through a substantial national information campaign.  In addition there is a Community Outreach Programme aimed at providing local assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, I do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.</p><p>  In addition to the information campaign and Outreach Programme, on September 10th I launched National Digital Switchover Week.  Organised by my Department in partnership with The Wheel and Irish Rural Link, the week which runs from 17th-23rd   September, will see 26 local Digital Outreach Champions across the country organise events aimed at encouraging local communities to get informed, make the switch to digital TV and not leave it until the last minute.  Many retailers throughout the country will also be offering special deals as part of the National Digital Switchover Week.</p><p>  As there are only 36 days to go before the 24 October deadline, I would urge all Deputies to engage with the Outreach Programme and Digital Switchover Week at a local level in order to urge constituents to move to digital now and not to wait until the last minute.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent statutory body.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.</p><p>  The upward trend in global oil and gas prices arises primarily from the increases in the international prices for these commodities over which Ireland has no control.  For example, the spot price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has risen from a low of $90 in June 2012 to $116 yesterday.  This represents an increase of 29% in less than three months.  This has inevitably resulted in an increase in retail oil prices.  International gas prices have also risen leading to the increase in regulated gas prices as sanctioned by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p>  Against this background my focus and that of the Government is on interventions that can assist in mitigating to some degree, increases in energy prices.  At a general policy level this involves measures to improve energy efficiency and increase the penetration of renewable energy resources in the areas of electricity and transport.</p><p>  I am very aware that many households are experiencing financial hardship due to the current economic difficulties. As such the Government is taking a range of actions to address the challenge of affordable energy for vulnerable households.  </p><p>  In specific terms over the last ten years &euro;2 billion has been distributed in energy supports under the National Fuel Scheme and the Household Benefits Package administered by the Department of Social Protection while &euro;80 million has been spent on energy efficiency improvements in vulnerable homes.  Permanent improvements to the thermal efficiency of houses are the most cost-effective means of addressing energy poverty.  In this regard, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers on behalf of my Department, the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, which is free-of-charge to eligible applicants.  With over 85,000 homes refurbished to date, 2012 will see a further 17,000 low-income households benefit from energy efficiency upgrades.  I have allocated just over &euro;17 million to the Warmer Homes Scheme this year.  </p><p>  More generally, the Government&rsquo;s Strategy for Affordable Energy in Ireland was launched by me last November.  The Strategy sets out our plans for enhancing the affordability of energy for low-income households.  The strategy includes 48 actions that will be implemented over the life of the Strategy.</p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy has established subgroups to work on particular dimensions of the Strategy.  These include the implementation of revised eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme and a pilot programme to assess the feasibility of an area-based approach to delivery of the Scheme.  </p><p>  In the area of transport the development of electric vehicles offers potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.  The Government has introduced a grant scheme for electric vehicles.</p><p>  In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.</p><p>  The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 and currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.  The scheme ensured that 144.5 million litres of biofuel were brought to the Irish market in 2011.</p><p>  The Better Energy programme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, as well as bringing on board energy suppliers as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers.  </p><p>  Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security.</p></reply>

TV viewers who currently use pay TV are unaffected.  The replacement digital &#8220;free to air&#8221; TV network, SAORVIEW, has been nationally available since May 2011. Alternatively, TV viewers can choose to upgrade to a pay TV service such as cable or satellite.  </p><p><br />  SAORVIEW currently provides access to &#8220;free to air&#8221; TV to almost 98% of the population and will fulfil the full extent of its coverage obligations by <sup>24</sup>   October 2012.  Thirteen smaller sites will go live between September 24 and October 1.  As a result, SAORVIEW will provide in excess of 98% coverage.  SAORVIEW will be providing information at a local level to residents in these areas in relation to SAORVIEW coverage.</p><p><br />  For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012.  SAORSAT is a &#8220;free to air&#8221; satellite system providing access to RT&Eacute; channels and TG4.  Since March 2012, therefore, everyone in Ireland can make the switch to digital.</p><p><br />  I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings for those households that are reliant on the existing &#8220;free to air&#8221; analogue TV network.  In this regard, to compliment the national information and awareness campaign and the Outreach programme, on Monday 10<sup>th</sup>   September I announced details of National Digital Switchover Week which is taking place from 17th &#8211; 23rd September, 2012.</p><p><br />  Organised by my Department in partnership with The Wheel and Irish Rural Link, the week will see 26 local Digital Outreach Champions across the country organise events in their communities to encourage those who have not yet switched to digital TV to do so during National Digital Switchover Week.  A list of events is available on </p><p><br />  The information and awareness campaign rolled out in October 2011 will continue until the end of 2012.  The campaign provides information on what is happening, the timelines and the different choices available to upgrade to digital.  This comprehensive campaign includes advertising on TV, local and national radio; an analogue marker (red x 24 October) to act as a constant reminder to everyone using the analogue service to switch to digital; research; a dedicated website &#8211;     and national telephone helpline; and an information booklet which was delivered to every household in the country.</p><p><br />  Ongoing local awareness initiatives led by the Digital Outreach Champions as part of the Department&#8217;s Outreach Programme has made a concerted effort over the past 6 months, in particular, to remind people not to get left behind and make the switch. </p><p><br />  Furthermore, I and officials in my Department are continuing to work closely with RT&Eacute;, TG4, TV3, RT&Eacute;NL, ComReg and the BAI and our colleagues in Northern Ireland to ensure a smooth transition to digital broadcasting in the country.</p><p><br />  As there are only 36 days to go before the 24 October deadline, I would urge all Deputies to engage with the Outreach Programme and Digital Switchover Week at a local level in order to urge constituents to move to digital now and not to wait until the last minute.  </p></reply>

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p><p>  The Kinsale area gas fields are now nearing depletion and currently provide approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas requirements.  The Corrib gas field is under development and first gas is not anticipated before late 2014.  All four gas fields are held under petroleum leases issued by my Department.  </p><p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.</p><p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production.</p><p>  While the amount paid in tax is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners, I can advise that the amount received in royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields since production commenced is &euro;193.8 million.</p><p>The rate of tax that will apply to any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence granted since January 2007 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.  </p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates. </p><p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government agreed to the drafting of an amending Bill and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.</p><p>  Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities. Rates provide the means by which local authorities can fund the services essential to communities, and therefore business, across the full range of local activities including roads, water and waste services, fire and emergency, libraries and a range of community, amenity and social activities.</p><p>  I have, however, asked local authorities to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoption of their 2012 budgets.  From the adopted Budgets for 2012 submitted to my Department by the 88 rating local authorities, 68 authorities have maintained their ARVs at 2011 levels and 19 local authorities have reduced their ARVs.  One local authority has increased its ARV and will continue to increase it until 2015, but this is a technical adjustment and legal requirement following the extension of a town boundary. Overall, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.</p><p>  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under consideration in my Department.</p><p>  In relation to water charges, local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from all non-domestic users of these services. This is in accordance with the polluter pays principle and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive. The policy provides for full cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption. The cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector includes elements of infrastructure provision including meter installation and operation and maintenance costs, and varies from authority to authority. The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has therefore been decided that water meters should also be installed in households connected to public water supplies.</p><p>  The Government has also decided, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.  The establishment of Irish Water will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of water services delivery and ensure competitively priced water services are made available to users of these services.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p><p>  Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must meet the following criteria: have had their mortgage deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as provided for under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears; agree to a voluntary repossession of their home; be eligible for social housing support, and; not have significant positive equity in the property.</p><p>  Additionally applicants must own the property, and it must have a current market value of less than &euro;220,000 in the Dublin area or less than &euro;180,000 in the rest of the country.  The property must be in good condition, be in a suitable location and must suit the household&rsquo;s needs. In addition applicants must not own any other property or have assets in excess of &euro;20,000 and the net household annual income must not exceed a maximum of &euro;35,000, depending on its location.  Borrowers wishing to avail of this scheme may access further information on the Housing Agency website, www.housing.ie.</p></reply>

In order to assist with this situation, I have decided to grant an extension to the period during which chemical fertiliser may be applied.  The closed period for chemical fertiliser will now commence on 1 October 2012 instead of 15 September 2012.  I have also decided to extend the period for spreading livestock manures produced on farms.  In this instance, the closed period was due to start on 15 October 2012 but will not now commence until 1 November 2012.</p><p>  The purpose of these extensions is to allow farmers the opportunity to optimize the management of manure disposal on their farms while also addressing fodder shortages through extended grazing.  In the interest of minimising the risk to the aquatic environment and maximising the return on application, farmers should apply fertilisers as early as possible, as conditions allow.  Application is conditional on weather and ground conditions being suitable as set out in the Nitrates Regulations.</p></reply>

Following negotiations between Member States and the European Commission, the proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 11 September 2012.  All EU Member States will be required to transpose the new Directive into national law.</p><p><br />  The aim of the new Directive is to reduce air pollution from the shipping sector thereby protecting human health and the environment. This will be achieved through a lower sulphur content limit for marine fuel in order to reduce sulphur oxide emissions. Ireland supported the aim of the new Directive throughout the negotiation process and welcomes its adoption by the European Parliament.</p><p><br />  The new Directive, for the most part, aligns EU legislation with the International Maritime Organisation&#8217;s (IMO) <i>International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships</i><i></i>(known as the MARPOL Convention). Ireland is party to MARPOL and has already implemented most of the provisions of the new Directive through regulations previously given effect by the Minister for Transport,<i></i>the <i>Sea Pollution (Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships) Regulations 2010)</i>.</p><p><br />  The difference between MARPOL and the new Directive is the timing of the introduction of the new lower 0.5% sulphur content limit in marine fuel. Under MARPOL, and current national legislation giving effect to MARPOL, the 0.5% maximum sulphur content limit will apply in 2020 or in 2025, depending on an IMO review to be completed in 2018.  The new Directive introduces the 0.5% sulphur content limit for marine fuel in 2020 regardless of the outcome of the 2018 IMO review.</p><p><br />  The provisions of the new Directive apply equally to shipping operators in all EU Member States. The new Directive also provides for a degree of greater clarity in that 2020 is now confirmed as the deadline by which the shipping sector must prepare for the switchover to lower sulphur fuel.</p></reply>

The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.  A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.</p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences available under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.  Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.  The fines for continuing offences are &euro;1,000 per day for summary offences and &euro;130,000 per day for indictable offences.  Under section 58 of the 1996 Act (as amended) a court may also make an order which requires a person who is holding, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner that is causing environmental pollution to remediate the effects of their actions in a specified manner and within a specified period.  It is at the discretion of the local authorities, which have responsibilities for enforcement of both the Litter Pollution Act and the Waste Management Act, to decide whether a specific incident warrants the application of either Act.</p><p>  My Department is currently considering the introduction to the Waste Management Act of an on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly tipping/small scale illegal dumping of a significantly higher quantum than that which exists under the Litter Pollution Act. There are no plans to amend the Waste Management Act to include rewards to citizens who assist in bringing convictions at this time.</p><p>  My Department is also running an anti-dumping campaign in the print media to raise awareness of the value of our countryside both environmentally and economically.  The campaign includes the contact details for the National Environmental Complaints hotline (1850 365 121) to encourage the reporting of instances of illegal dumping.  I believe that the combined efforts of the public, communities, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency will produce a reduction in such instances and result in a cleaner countryside.</p></reply>

Those identified as having responsibility include quarries, material suppliers, vendors, builders/subcontractors and relevant insurance companies.</p><p>  On receipt of the pyrite report I immediately engaged in discussions with the key stakeholders, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Banking Federation and the Irish Insurance Federation and outlined my position to them and what I expected from them in the context of advancing solutions for homeowners.  I have set a deadline of the end of September for them to come back to me with credible solutions.  As I have previously stated, my preferred approach to deal with this problem is for the stakeholders to take ownership of the problem and work with me in advancing solutions for affected homeowners.  However, in the absence of credible proposals from the stakeholders, I will consider an imposed solution along the lines recommended in the report in relation to the establishment of a Resolution Board which could be funded by a levy on the construction/quarrying sectors and the related insurance sector.</p><p>  I have asked the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to develop a testing and categorisation protocol for reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material and a method statement to provide guidance for the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings.  This work has already commenced.  The NSAI has set up two broad based Technical Standards Committees with people who have expertise in the particular areas and they have also sought written submissions from the public.  They are aware of the timeframe which the Pyrite Panel suggested for the completion of this work and they are also aware of the urgency I am attaching to it.  The testing protocol will facilitate the categorisation of dwellings to determine the appropriate approaches to remediation and provide guidance on how monitoring of pyrite damage should be undertaken.  It will also  incorporate a certification process.</p><p>  I agree with the proposition in the pyrite report that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hardcore and this position is supported in the High Court judgement of Mr Justice Charleton in the case of JEC-v-Irish Asphalt which is on appeal to the Supreme Court.  The pyrite report details the basis for arriving at this decision.  I believe the approach suggested by the Pyrite Panel to classify the dwellings into red, amber and green is a practical solution to prioritise the remediation of affected dwellings.</p><p>  The Pyrite Panel recommends progressive implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  Implementation of many of the recommendations requires the involvement and co-operation of a number of stakeholders and other bodies and may also involve detailed policy and legislative considerations.  The Pyrite Panel included a detailed Implementation Plan in its report identifying the bodies with primary responsibility for implementation of the various recommendations.  While it is not possible to put a definite timeframe on implementation at this early stage, I will be working with those bodies identified in the Implementation Plan to achieve progress as quickly as possible.</p><p>  Recommendations in relation to the development of a mandatory certification system for buildings and a registration process for builders are currently being dealt with by my Department under the Building Control reform programme that I announced last year.  I hope to have revised Building Control Regulations signed in the next few months.</p><p>  The Pyrite Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in relation to the potential exposure to pyrite problems.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced, to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.  Seventy four estates were identified to the Panel which amounts to 12,250 ground floor dwellings.  Of these dwellings, the Panel understands that approximately 850 dwellings currently have a claim with a guarantee provider and a further 1,100 dwellings have already been remediated or are in the process of being remediated, leaving  the remaining 10,300 ground floor dwellings as the estimated future potential exposure to pyrite. However, it should be noted that in the case of 23 estates (included in the figure of 74 above), with 3,250 ground floor dwellings, there are no claims with structural warranty companies or no other evidence to support the view that they have pyrite problems other than being notified to the Pyrite Panel.  Taking cognisance of the methodology used to conduct the study and the rate of presentation in Ireland to date, I am reasonably confident that the figures given represent the extent of potential future exposure to pyrite.</p></reply>

Furthermore the Rural Development Programme (LEADER) delivered under my Department, aims to improve the quality of life and support the diversification of economic activity in rural areas.  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) supports a broad range of activities including support for the creation and development of micro-enterprises in rural areas.  The RDP for Ireland 2007- 2013 has a substantial budget of almost &euro;400m, which represents a significant lever to stimulate economic development in rural areas.  Over the next 4 years, it is projected that the LEADER Programme will assist in the creation of up to 6,000 new jobs.</p><p>In addition my Department's Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), which commenced in January 2010, aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The Programme is underpinned by four high level goals, one of which, while not directly creating new jobs, is aimed at increasing peoples&rsquo; work readiness and employment prospects.  In this regard, the table below outlines the number of individuals supported into employment and into self-employment in 2011 and the target for 2012.</p><p><pfli1>            </pfli1><table><tr><th>LCDP</th><th>2012 Targets</th><th> 2011 Outputs</th></tr><tr><td>Individuals supported into employment</td><td><div>966</div></td><td><div>1,121</div></td></tr><tr><td>Individuals supported into self-employment</td><td><div>4,647</div></td><td><div>5,042</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>5,613</div></td><td><div>6,163</div></td></tr></table></p><p>Local authorities also have an important role in providing much of the physical and regulatory infrastructure essential to support enterprise and promote employment.  They deliver essential services to business and are geared to respond to the needs of local communities, employers and entrepreneurs speedily and efficiently.  Local authorities are very active in promoting the commercial and enterprise interests of their areas, working with other State agencies and local business across all areas that can benefit their local communities and the enterprise sector.  Local authorities are acutely aware of the need to assist in the response to the jobs crisis at the local level, and assist and network with other agencies in the delivery of their responses to the crisis at the local level.  It is in that context that achievement of measures in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; 2012</i> will assist in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones.</p><p>My Department has no direct commitments in relation to the creation of new jobs in either the <i>Jobs Initiative &ndash; May 2011</i> or <i>Budget 2012</i>.  My Department&rsquo;s commitments in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; 2012</i>, in some instances in cooperation with other Departments, local authorities and agencies are in relation to Actions 1.17, 1.22, 1.23, 1.47, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9 and 7.3.2.  Progress to date has been reported in respect of Quarter 1 and Quarter 2 of 2012, but for the reasons set out above, numbers of jobs resulting have not been identified.  I am advised that copies of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; 2012</i> and Progress Reports are available at <i>www.djei.ie</i>.</p></reply>

In the case of 23 of these estates, no pyrite related claims have been made to structural guarantee companies nor did there appear to be any significant evidence, at the time the Panel undertook its work, to support the contention that there are pyrite problems in all or any of these cases.  I have asked the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to develop protocols for:</p><p>- testing and categorisation of  reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material, </p><p>- a method statement specifying a methodology for the removal and replacement of hardcore in buildings with pyrite.</p><p>It has set up Technical Standards Committees, with broad representation of people with an expertise in the particular areas, to assist in undertaking this work; they have also sought written submissions from the public.</p><p>  The testing and categorisation protocol will address the assessment of damage and approaches to testing and categorisation of dwellings.  The method statement will give guidance for dealing with sulfate attack where it occurs.   The Pyrite Panel considered the issue of sulfate attack and in its report stated that it had been informed by a number of experts, directly involved in cases of damage caused by pyritic heave that sulfate attack had not presented, at that time, as a significant structural issue.</p><p>  The pyrite report recommends the development of a standalone specification for hardcore for use under concrete floors in buildings, with a requirement for appropriate testing by quarries to demonstrate compliance.  I have also asked NSAI to undertake this work and they have agreed to do so.  The limits to be applied for pyrite will be considered having regard to the knowledge and expertise developed over the past number of years.  The remit of the Pyrite Panel was to consider the issue of pyrite in hardcore used in private housing and it did not deal with the issue of pyrite in blocks.  However, according to the Panel it was not informed of any failures of concrete or concrete products, due to aggregates containing reactive pyrite being used as a constituent of the concrete, at the same time or in the locality of where the problems of hardcore occurred.</p><p>  Pending the completion of the work on the testing and categorisation protocol by the NSAI, I am not in a position to consider what, if any, issues will arise for homeowners who have already undertaken testing but I would hope that the protocol will not create any additional expense for homeowners.  </p></reply>

I set a deadline of the end of September for them to come back to me with credible proposals to provide solutions for homeowners.

The charge is set at &euro;200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>  While I have no plans to introduce an instalment payment system for this charge, I recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  The guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in relation to entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  I expect local authorities to implement these guidelines appropriately.</p></reply>

These amendments provide scope for Local Development Companies (LDCs) to have greater flexibility to deliver actions that support the achievement of the objectives of their local development strategies and thereby increase the likelihood of the success of the programme. My Department is responsible for ensuring that the aims and objectives of the RDP are achieved and has implemented systems which reflect this new approach and which will support LDCs in delivering the RDP in an efficient and effective way in their local areas. This approach, supported by the European Commission, will also ensure that the financial resources available through the RDP are used to their full potential.  The increase in the EU co-financing rate to 85% for Axes 3 &amp; 4 of the RDP, which applies to expenditure in 2012 and 2013, will also have an impact on the Programme complement, the outcome of which will become more apparent as expenditure progresses in 2013.</p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>LAG</th><th><div>Original allocation</div></th><th><div>Original Project Allocation</div></th><th><div>Original Administration Allocation</div></th><th><div>Project Expenditure approved to date</div></th><th><div>Project Expenditure to date</div></th><th><div>Administration Expenditure to date</div></th></tr><tr><td>Avondhu/ Blackwater Partnership Limited (Cork East)</td><td><div>9,057,810</div></td><td><div>7,246,248</div></td><td><div>1,811,562</div></td><td><div>3,830,647.43</div></td><td><div>2,722,653.07</div></td><td><div>1,071,827.95</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Limited (Limerick East &amp; North Cork)</td><td><div>11,673,519</div></td><td><div>9,338,816</div></td><td><div>2,334,703</div></td><td><div>9,267,048.88</div></td><td><div>4,058,454.30</div></td><td><div>1,734,673.20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Development Partnership Limited</td><td><div>8,878,177</div></td><td><div>7,102,542</div></td><td><div>1,775,635</div></td><td><div>3,052,847.10</div></td><td><div>2,482,948.17</div></td><td><div>1,130,324.31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Partnership Ltd. &amp; County Monaghan Area Partnership Ltd.</td><td><div>12,035,118</div></td><td><div>9,628,095</div></td><td><div>2,407,023</div></td><td><div>3,907,189.99</div></td><td><div>2,114,191.44</div></td><td><div>1,339,980.57</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare Local Development Company Limited</td><td><div>14,028,529</div></td><td><div>11,222,823</div></td><td><div>2,805,706</div></td><td><div>7,157,462.00</div></td><td><div>4,057,534.00</div></td><td><div>1,666,112.87</div></td></tr><tr><td>Comhar na nOile&aacute;in Teoranta</td><td><div>4,642,415</div></td><td><div>3,713,932</div></td><td><div>928,483</div></td><td><div>2,223,699.72</div></td><td><div>1,299,568.76</div></td><td><div>684,559.87</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Local Development Company Limited</td><td><div>12,831,901</div></td><td><div>10,265,521</div></td><td><div>2,566,380</div></td><td><div>4,868,923.61</div></td><td><div>2,666,557.01</div></td><td><div>1,514,313.76</div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal LEADER Partnership (Dublin Rural)</td><td><div>7,766,780</div></td><td><div>6,213,424</div></td><td><div>1,553,356</div></td><td><div>2,106,834.67</div></td><td><div>617,984.07</div></td><td><div>799,727.20</div></td></tr><tr><td>FORUM Connemara</td><td><div>9,668,965</div></td><td><div>7,735,172</div></td><td><div>1,933,793</div></td><td><div>2,492,928.53</div></td><td><div>1,420,230.14</div></td><td><div>906,515.46</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway Rural Development Company Limited</td><td><div>15,257,985</div></td><td><div>12,206,388</div></td><td><div>3,051,597</div></td><td><div>6,021,338.73</div></td><td><div>3,593,476.54</div></td><td><div>1,441,471.98</div></td></tr><tr><td>Inishowen Development Partnership</td><td><div>8,286,143</div></td><td><div>6,628,914</div></td><td><div>1,657,229</div></td><td><div>3,889,308.00</div></td><td><div>2,549,770.48</div></td><td><div>910,764.17</div></td></tr><tr><td>I.R.D.

The next meeting of Comhairle na Tuaithe is scheduled for 20 September  2012. All of these meetings to date have been chaired by my Department, and I have not been present at them.</p><p><br />  Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council) continuously supports and oversees the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy and its associated schemes, programmes and activities. Since March 2011 progress has been made on a number of issues including;</p><p><b>Mountain Access </b></p><p><br />  A Pilot Mountain Access scheme has been developed, Its purpose is to facilitate access to the uplands for hill walking and similar activities. Pilot schemes have been developed at Mount Gable in Connemara where 94 landowners are involved; a second pilot is under development in Carrauntoohil and the MacGillicuddy Reeks in Co. Kerry. This pilot is currently being expanded from an initial 8/10 landowners to approximately 150 landowners and will encompass an area of about 100<sup>2</sup>Km . An indemnity scheme for landowners is a requirement of this process.</p><p><b>Indemnity Scheme</b></p><p><br />  A National Indemnity Scheme for Landowners to facilitate access to private lands for recreation and tourism purposes is currently under development in association with the State Claims Agency following approval by Comhairle Na Tuaithe.</p><p><b>Access Issues</b></p><p><br />  An Access and Public Liability document which has been prepared through Comhairle na Tuaithe is currently with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. I  anticipate that this document will be available to the public in the coming weeks, to provide clarification to landowners and recreational users  regarding access to private lands and the situation regarding public liability. </p><p><b>National Countryside Recreation Strategy</b></p><p><br />  Comhairle na Tuaithe has agreed a list of  the top ten priorities of the National Countryside Recreadion Strategy and partners have taken positions to support delivery of these agreed actions.</p><p><b>State Agencies</b></p><p><br />  Through Comhairle na Tuaithe various state agencies with land holdings have come together to produce a draft National Outdoor Recreation Plan for Public Lands and Waters in Ireland. Together they have identified a vision, objectives and a common approach to managing, maintaining, facilitating and developing outdoor recreation opportunities on Ireland&#8217;s publicly owned lands. The draft plan has been prepared by the Department and those bodies that are public land and waterway owners or fishery owners, together with  other organisations that set policy or support developments in outdoor recreation. When finalised it will form part of the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy. I expect negotiations on the final version of the plan to be concluded shortly.</p><p><b>Walks Scheme</b></p><p> The Walks Scheme continues to be implemented and currently has 1,805 participants on over 40 trails; this includes 20 National Way Marked Ways and 20 F&aacute;ilte Ireland Looped Walks and other priority walks that traverse both public and private lands. These participant landowners received &#8364;1.91m in annual maintenance payments in 2011 to maintain these trails.</p><p><b>New Contracts with Local Development Companies</b></p><p><br />  New Service Level Agreements have been signed with 12 Local Development Companies for the delivery of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy at county level and continuing implementation of the Walks Scheme and other appropriate schemes and actions to implement the priority objectives of the Strategy. These agreements have facilitated the continuation of the role of the  Rural Recreation Officers to maintain their profile and the good work that has been acomplished to date.</p><p><br />  I anticipate that Comhairle na Tuaithe and its constituent members and stakeholders will continue their work on the delivery of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy over the coming months. I would like to express my appreciation for work and commitment of the various stakeholders to date.</p></reply>

The waivers which apply concern - </p><p>- Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, and</p><p>- Owners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates. </p><p>  While there is no specific exemption for properties affected by pyrite, the owner of a property which is not occupied or suitable for occupation on the liability date would not be liable for the household charge.</p><p>  I have recently published the report of the independent Pyrite Panel.  The Pyrite Report recommends that consideration be given to providing an exemption from the proposed property tax, for a set period, for dwellings where damage from pyritic heave has been proved by testing.  While the Government will have regard to this recommendation as appropriate in the context of the proposed property tax legislation, no decisions have been made as yet on the details of the local property tax, including what exemptions might apply.</p></reply>

The Panel used the information it had collected to estimate the possible distribution of the ground floor dwellings across the three classifications of red, amber and green.   However, it should be noted that the inclusion of a dwelling in the 850 figure does not necessarily mean that the dwelling has been confirmed as having reactive pyrite in the hardcore and/or pyritic heave.</p><p>The pyrite report clearly states that those parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should bear the costs of remediation.  Those identified as having responsibility include quarries, material suppliers, vendors, builders/subcontractors and relevant insurance companies.  It is not intended that the establishment of any remediation process should absolve responsible parties, including warranty companies, from meeting their obligations under the terms and conditions of their respective schemes.</p><p>  While I have no function in the operation of warranty companies I have expressed my disappointment with the stance adopted by HomeBond in withdrawing, in August 2011, cover for pyrite related damage to homeowners. I fully support the recommendation in the pyrite report that HomeBond should review its position and reinstate cover for pyrite damage.  Following receipt of the pyrite report I engaged with all key stakeholders, including HomeBond, with the objective of advancing solutions for homeowners. I have given the stakeholders until the end of September to come back to me with credible solutions to the pyrite problem.</p></reply>

RAS involves a three way contractual relationship between landlord, tenant and the housing authority.  The housing authority are responsible for payment of the rent to the landlord, and the landlord is contractually obliged to maintain the property in good condition and deal with any repair issues in a timely manner.  The tenant also has a contract with the housing authority, whereby they agree to pay a rental contribution to the authority based on the differential rent scheme.  In the event that the tenant does not make the rental contribution to the authority, under the terms of the three way agreement the authority may direct that the landlord serve notice to quit on the tenant. If the landlord fails to serve such a notice to quit then this may be a breach of the agreement between the authority and the landlord.</p></reply>

These include the incremental purchase scheme, the availability of loan finance from local authorities for house purchase, including open market purchase, and the tenant purchase scheme.  Two types of house purchase loan are available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221;.  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009-2012 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively. These are available on my Department&#8217;s website: . </p><p><br />  While there is no reference in the Regulations to a lower income limit threshold for mortgage applicants, the associated credit policy provides a procedure for calculating the maximum amount of mortgage repayments permissible as a percentage of the household income.  Local authorities are advised to examine each application on its own merits in determining whether an applicant is eligible for a house purchase loan.  It is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased since the credit policy was introduced.  However, it is also clear that the loans issued under that credit policy are more likely to be fully performing.  I consider  the current arrangements are fair and adequately meet the needs of prospective home owners in a prudent manner.</p></reply>

In one case, the court ruled that there was a dispute as to the facts and made a declaration that section 62(3) of the 1966 Act is incompatible with the State&rsquo;s obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  In the other case, the court ruled that there was no dispute as to the facts and did not make a declaration of incompatibility.  Section 5(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 provides that a declaration of incompatibility in respect of an enactment does not affect its validity, continuing operation or enforcement.

The series provides a simple average of prices with a breakdown between the main urban areas.  Unlike the Central Statistics Office&#8217;s Residential Property Price Index the series is not mix-adjusted to take account of the different types of property sold.

My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA to discuss air quality issues.

The Pyrite Panel was set up on an independent basis to explore options for an agreed resolution to the problem of pyrite in private dwellings.  While I have always stated that the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem, I believe it has a duty to assist homeowners in finding a resolution to what is a very difficult situation for them and this was one of my key objectives in setting up the Panel.  The Panel operated independently of me and I believe that it undertook its work in a fair and impartial manner producing a well- researched and balanced report.  As can be seen from Appendix 1 of the report, which lists the groups and individuals the Panel met with, it consulted widely, including with: homeowners, industry, academia, professional bodies, banks, insurance providers and local authorities.  While not everyone will agree with all of the recommendations they are supported by the broadly based consultation undertaken, and I understand that the report has been well received generally.  It is very clear about where responsibility for the pyrite problem lies and who should pay the costs associated with the remediation of pyrite damaged dwellings.  The report provides a comprehensive framework to move forward towards achieving a solution for homeowners and I have already begun this process.</p></reply>

To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).</p><p>  Under the Shared Ownership scheme, the intending purchaser initially acquired a minimum 40% share in the dwelling, with a requirement that they purchase the full ownership within 25 years. The purchaser was required to pay rent on the local authority&rsquo;s share. These rent payments are intended largely to meet the cost of funding provided by the Housing Finance Agency to local authorities to finance the rented share in the equity of the house. Rent is calculated at 4.3% of the value of the share in the ownership held by the local authority.  This amount is increased annually by 4.5%, and excludes any rent subsidy due. The rental formula applied under the scheme is not comparable to rents in the private rented sector, which are determined by the operation of the market. Therefore, movements in private sector rent levels would have no relevant bearing on the calculation of the rental element under shared ownership.</p><p>  To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes, including the Shared Ownership scheme, in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes, including the Shared Ownership Scheme, will be informed by the review.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p><p><br />  Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must: have had their mortgage deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as provided for under the Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears; agree to a voluntary repossession of their home; be eligible for social housing support and; not have significant positive equity in the property.</p><p><br />  Limits on household income, property value and applicant assets also apply. Borrowers wishing to avail of this scheme may access further information on the Housing Agency website, <i>www.housing.ie</i>  .</p><p><br />  More than sixty cases are currently being processed under this scheme, with a potential take-up of approximately one hundred cases in 2012. Financing for the scheme is by means of loans to the approved housing bodies concerned from either the original lender or the Housing Finance Agency in respect of up to 7.5% of the value of the property, with 25% funding available from my Department under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. The overall allocation under the CALF scheme for 2012 is &#8364;20 million.</p></reply>

Kerry. There are 94 landholders associated with the pilot scheme at Mount Gable. The scope of the scheme at Carrauntuohill requires review as it is not feasible to progress a pilot scheme there in isolation from the rest of the MacGillcuddy Reeks.  Subject to the availability of funding, it will be expanded to include an area of approximately 100 square km stretching from the Gap of Dunloe in the east to Glencar on the West.  Discussions with landowners and other stakeholders is ongoing. </p><p>  As mountain access areas are by their nature sensitive habitats, great care must be taken to ensure that proposed developments do not generate negative consequences and lead to environmental degradation and habitat destruction. It is clear that some upland areas and mountains are already suffering damage from recreational activity and a properly constructed and funded Mountain Access Scheme offers an opportunity to address these matters.</p><p>  A requirement of the proposed scheme is that participating landowners are provided with an indemnity, to protect against any potential claim arising from an accident or injury to a hill walker. Negotiations with the farming organisations on the scope and scale of such a scheme are underway and the scheme cannot proceed without their agreement.   Such a national indemnity scheme could significantly improve access to the countryside, generate potential for tourism and recreation - related job creation and associated development opportunities in rural areas.</p><p>  A list of additional candidate mountain access areas is currently being compiled and assessed and there is strong demand from local communities and some landowners for these to progress. The timing and further roll out of the scheme is dependent on the further availability of funding.</p></reply>

However there are now 40 trails covered by the Scheme, with annual payments of &euro;1,910,000 to 1,805 landholders who maintain them. It is intended that any additional efficiencies and savings that can be generated in the scheme will be put towards priority walks and improvements in the existing trails comprehended by the scheme.</p><p>  Despite current financial constraints there are now 871 trails listed on the irishtrails.ie website, which are fully open to the public and being maintained to the appropriate national standards. Consideration is now being given to the assessment of the optimum number of trails required to provide an appropriate level of choice, quality and grade of trail for recreational users and tourists alike. This will ensure trails are developed on the basis of identified need and that the costs associated with the development and ongoing maintenance of trails will be minimised.</p></reply>

A significant portion of the 2012 budget allocation (&euro;2.35m) was expended early in 2012.  My Department is also continuing to register Community and Voluntary groups who wish to administer the Scheme and this has further increased the demand for funding in 2012.  </p><p>  Given the unavoidable constraints on funding generally, my Department examined the operation of the scheme with the aim of ensuring its sustainability and an equitable distribution of available funding country-wide. The following temporary changes were notified to groups on 26 March 2012, and took effect from 30 March 2012:</p><p>-  Funding will only be available for the purchase and installation of socially monitored alarms at a maximum of &euro;250 per alarm. (Maximum funding of &euro;50 is also available for additional pendants and reinstallations).</p><p>- Grants to Community and Voluntary groups will be capped at &euro;30,000 per annum  .</p><p>  The aim of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to support independent living for those over 65 who live alone or who live with a person who is also over 65 years of age and of limited financial means. A key element of the Scheme is the provision of funding for a socially monitored alarm which supports this independence. Having regard to available funding in the current economic climate, the changes above will ensure that my Department can continue to maintain the Scheme in a viable way and provide the maximum number of socially monitored alarms to as many older persons as possible in 2012.  So far this year &euro;2,007,800 has been spent on the scheme, providing equipment to 6,671 beneficiaries.</p></reply>

The consultation period runs until 21 September and I invite all interested parties to make their views known. This code will be a first step towards a statutory regulatory framework that will protect the very significant State investment in the sector over the last two decades and will provide assistance to those working in the sector to meet the challenges ahead.  This code will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop this longer-term statutory framework to best support the enhanced role of AHBs. </p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to just over &euro;333.7m this year, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities are now operating, a tentative projection of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units is anticipated for 2012.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as social leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In this regard, the Housing Finance Agency has received twelve applications for Certified Borrower status and awarded status to four bodies. The Agency has approved four applications for 98 social housing units in total (at a valuation of &euro;13.4 million). It is envisaged that further lending will be generated for the Agency in 2012, under this scheme, with more approved housing bodies applying for Certified Body status and subsequent loan applications for social housing schemes.</p><p>  I am conscious that the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them. I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it by Government and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions. My Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse. This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.</p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA in the current year and beyond.</p></reply>

My Department&#8217;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management provides support through setting general policy, the provision of training support and guidance on operational and other related matters and capital funding which, over the last decade, has exceeded &#8364;180 million. My Department provides capital grants to:</p><p>- Construct modern fire stations and for improvement works to existing stations</p><p>- Acquire front line fire appliances, (including specialist appliances) and </p><p>- Acquire emergency and rescue equipment and communications equipment. </p><p><br />  There have been very significant improvements in fire service infrastructure, fleet and equipment in recent years, and Ireland is now acknowledged to have a first rate infrastructure for its fire service. </p><p><br />  My Department&#8217;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is currently developing a policy document called <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i>   (KCS) which is intended to set the future direction of fire services in Ireland. The draft policy document seeks to define an integrated approach to efficient fire safety by ensuring an appropriate response to incidents from the fire service while strengthening the service&#8217;s role in fire prevention and community fire safety.  The KCS document represents the outcome of a wide ranging review of all the activities that go into the provision of fire services &#8211; including the roles which fire services should provide for society into the future and having the right structures in place to deliver effective services efficiently. It also looks at finding the right balance between fire prevention, fire protection and response, all of which is underpinned by a risk categorisation approach. The National Directorate has engaged in a round of stakeholder consultation on the draft KCS document, which is available on my Department&#8217;s website at www.environ.ie, and it is intended to finalise the document in the near future. </p><p><br />  My Department has been working to assist local authorities in achieving consistent implementation of safety, health and welfare initiatives since the introduction of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation in 2005.  The development of an Ancillary Safety Statement Template for Fire Services (2007) and the National Incident Command System (2007) were significant contributions in this area. A national Critical Incident Stress Management programme has been provided for fire services staff. Among the National Directorate&#8217;s priorities over the last few years has been the preparation and issuing to all fire authorities of a suite of Standard Operating Guidelines (SOGs) which cover all aspects of fire service operations, as well as the publication of a range of operational guidance and running an Annual Training Programme for Officers. </p></reply>

The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.    </p><p><br />  The current Programme, which runs to the end of 2013, provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &#8364;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation.  The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles.  In the period, 2000 to 2011 (inclusive), over &#8364;5.5 billion has been invested in the water services sector; this led, inter alia,<i></i>  to an increase in drinking water storage capacity by a level equivalent to the needs of a population of 1,847,000.</p><p><br />  In order to create efficiencies, improve service delivery and achieve cost savings in the delivery of water services, the <i>Programme for Government</i>   provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure.   The Department is currently finalising work on the implementation strategy for the establishment of Irish Water.   This strategy will take account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition, that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects and that a sustainable funding model is put in place to support increased investment in the sector. </p></reply>

The selection, approval and prioritisation of individual schemes for advancement and funding under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocations provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities, including Kildare County Council.</p><p><br />  The block grant allocations provided by my Department to the water services authorities are based, in the first instance, on the requests for funding received from the water services authorities at the beginning of each year. There may also be some additional allocations, or variations to existing allocations, during the course of the year based on responses from the authorities to any reviews of expenditure which may be carried out. </p><p><br />  The <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &#8211; 2013</i>   provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Kildare.  While provision is made to commence contracts to the value of some &#8364;160 million in the county during the period of the programme, it was not possible to include the Ballyna Regional Water Supply Scheme amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion.  The programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth. A key input to the development of the programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kildare County Council, in response to my Department&#8217;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised by my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time. </p><p><br />  Progress under the <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010 &#8211; 2013</i>   was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  In response to the review process a proposal was received from Kildare County Council seeking to include a new scheme in the Programme that might facilitate Ballyna.  As there was no significant change in this scheme from the one submitted at the time of the Assessment of Needs, it was not among the strategically important schemes inserted into the Programme.</p></reply>

The Dunmore administrative area covers Dunmore, Glenamaddy, Williamstown and Ballymoe Garda Stations.  The Tuam administrative area covers Tuam, Headford, Corrofin, Barnaderg, Miltown and Kilconly Garda Stations.  When a Garda member in Williamstown is not on duty, cover is provided by Garda personnel on duty in Dunmore Station where there is one patrol car stationed.  Calls pertaining to the Dunmore administrative area are responded to by Garda personnel stationed in that area.

The Deputy will also recall that the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with legislation to abolish upward only rent reviews in existing commercial leases, i.e., those entered into prior to 28 February 2010.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.</p><p>  While legislative intervention may not be feasible, the Minister for Finance has outlined the role which NAMA can play in dealing with the problems caused by upward only rent reviews which apply to NAMA properties.  NAMA has published its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  Where there is a failure to reach agreement on revised contracts the policy guidance provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of market levels, and that the viability of the tenant is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuer to ascertain current market rent.  Where a tenant is not getting satisfaction he or she can contact NAMA directly.</p><p>  While overall responsibility for competitiveness policy rests with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, one of the difficulties in relation to rent reviews in the commercial property sector is the absence of readily accessible and accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  This issue has been addressed in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 which provides for the establishment and maintenance of a Commercial Leases Database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  Work is underway to ensure that the Database will be operational at an early date.</p><p>  Finally, I would also note the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was developed by an expert group whose membership was drawn from all relevant stakeholders and which provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.</p></reply>

Such funds are paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.  From time to time, it has been suggested that such monies should be used to fund community projects.  However, while my Department has previously consulted with the Department of Finance on the matter and it has been accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion, it is considered problematic and raises a number of practical difficulties.</p><p>  A policy of ring-fencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of these for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.  While allowing for a small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.  There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert such funds to local projects and additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.  It could also be argued that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.</p><p>  In the current economic climate the Exchequer could not sustain a loss of revenue without making compensatory adjustments.  If the monies collected by the Bureau were to be diverted to community projects, there would inevitably be implications for any other monies those projects received from the Exchequer.  Alternatively, other public expenditure programmes would have to sustain the loss.  There are currently no proposals to change the existing arrangements concerning such monies.</p></reply>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced.  The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, and in the context of the need to reduce Government spending, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources then envisaged, and that this should be deferred.  In light of this decision my Department is currently examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.</p><p>  It should be recalled that there is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.  Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.  This information can then be accessed by the public.  Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law.  And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.</p></reply>

I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner on all aspects of crime and crime prevention and will continue to support the steps An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking to raise awareness of these issues.  In particular, the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit has designed advice leaflets on home security and burglary which use a step by step checklist to highlight key measures that can be taken by members of the public.  A specific information leaflet on security for the older person has also been produced which addresses issues such as personal and home security, cash security and the issue of 'bogus callers'.</p><p><br />  As well as being available directly from the Garda&iacute; or from the Garda website, , the Garda&iacute; disseminate this information locally as part of their ongoing community policing work and through liaison with Community Alert,  Neighbourhood Watch and other local groups.  Garda&iacute; also take particular steps to interact with older people at a local level as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Older People Strategy and in conjunction with the Age Friendly County Initiative, Senior Citizen Information Days and other similar events.  In addition, through their work on Joint Policing Committees the advice and assistance provided by the Garda&iacute; can be further targeted to meet local conditions and needs, including with respect to the dissemination of crime prevention information.</p><p><br />  Insofar as national awareness campaigns are concerned, in May of this year the Garda Commissioner launched the national 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign'.  This important campaign highlighted a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention.  The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.  A further Garda awareness campaign is due to take place from 25th September to 2nd October which will again draw attention to crime prevention issues, including issues for older people.  In addition to these specific campaigns, the Garda&iacute; also make frequent use of broadcast media to highlight crime prevention advice, and the Crime Call TV programme, which is broadcast once a month to an average audience of 400,000 viewers, regularly includes advice and information on crime prevention.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the aims of the type of initiative he mentions are already being met through the above wide range of initiatives.</p></reply>

Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences and the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property.</p></reply>

One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions.  The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.

There are no plans at present to amend this procedure.</p><p>  I should also emphasise that the certificate is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.

Castlepollard Garda Station forms part of the Westmeath Garda Division.  The personnel strength of the Westmeath Garda Division, on the same date, was 253.  There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 21 Civilians attached to the Westmeath Garda Division.  These resources are augmented, when appropriate, by Garda&iacute; from national units.  I have been further informed that a Garda vehicle is allocated to the Castlepollard sub-district and that there has been no increase in the area to be covered by this vehicle.  Cover is also provided by the Divisional Traffic Corps and District Detective Unit as and when the need arises.  The Garda authorities state that they are satisfied that current policing arrangements make the best use of available resources in the delivery of a policing service to residents in the Castlepollard area.</p><p>  With regard to Finea and Rathowen Garda Stations, the general position is that the Garda Commissioner is currently engaged in an assessment of the potential for improved efficiencies in the structure and organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the preparation of the draft policing plan for 2013.  This plan is due to be submitted to me by the end of October this year and I expect that it will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts.  In the meantime, it would be premature, in advance of its submission, to speculate on specific measures which it might contain.</p></reply>

The Expert Group on Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights was established following the European Court on Human Rights finding against Ireland in the McFarlane case to make recommendations on the development of policy and legislative proposals for an effective domestic remedy as required by Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of violations of Article 6.  It is expected to report in the near future.  There is no cost associated with the establishment of this group. </p><p><br />  2. ICT Governance Group - this has been established within my own Department and is chaired at Assistant Secretary level.  The body is charged with the review and oversight of ICT spending within my Department and agencies.  There is no cost associated with the establishment of this group.</p><p><br />  3. Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was responsible for overseeing the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.  It was established by an agreement between the Irish and British Governments, signed on 26 August 1997, and by legislation enacted in the two jurisdictions.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011. The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &#8364;594,000.</p><p><br />  4. Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) was responsible for monitoring and reporting on paramilitary activity across Ireland and also for monitoring the security normalisation measures undertaken by the British Government in the North.  It was dissolved on 31 March 2011. The outturn for the Commission's last full year of operation 2010 was &#8364;426,000.</p><p>5. The Government following its meeting on 14 June 2011 decided to establish an  Inter-Departmental Committee which is independently chaired by Senator Martin McAleese, to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries, to clarify any State interaction, and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction.  No extra costs were incurred in establishing this Inter-Departmental Committee.  <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p><br />  6. Inter-Departmental Working Group on Corporate Manslaughter was established in January 2012.  The Chairman is due a flat fee of &#8364;4,000 (gross) on completion of his task.</p><p>7. The Internet Safety Advisory Council was appointed with effect from 1 December 2008.  It was neither statutory nor regulatory but it was advisory.  The mandate for the Internet Safety Advisory Council expired on 30 November 2011.  The Chair of the Internet Safety Advisory Council received remuneration of &#8364;8,978 per year.  The Internet Safety Advisory Committee succeeded the previous Internet Safety Advisory Council and it held its first meeting on 12 April 2012.  The Chair does not receive any remuneration.   <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p><p><br />  8. National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG) was established by Ms. Kathleen Lynch, T.D. Minister of State at my department with responsibility for disability.  The Group was established the on 30 November 2011.  The NDSIG is not an additional group in the sense that it has replaced and will build on the former National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group, which was in place under the previous Government.  There is no cost associated with the establishment of this group.</p><p><br />  9. National Steering Committee on Violence against Men which met for the first time on 14 December 2011.  There is no cost associated with the establishment of this committee.</p><p> 10. Prisons Authority Interim Board was abolished on 26 July, 2011.  The amount saved is in excess of &#8364;100,000 per annum. </p><p><br />  11. Property Services Regulatory Authority was established on a legal footing on 3 April 2012.  It has an annual budget for 2012 of &#8364;738,000.  </p><p>12.  Property Services Appeal  Board was established on 24 July 2012.  No costs have been incurred to date in respect of the Appeal Board. Board members will be paid a daily rate for each day they meet in accordance with rates and conditions sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><br />  13. Task Force on Cost Reductions in Criminal Legal Aid was established in May 2011 to identify changes which could potentially contribute to cost reductions on criminal legal aid (CLA).  The Task Force reported in October 2011.  The establishment of this Task Force did not incur any additional costs.</p><p><br />  14. Thornton Hall Review Group was established to review the need for the Thornton Hall Prison Project.  It was set up in April 2011 and reported to me in July 2011.  Review Group costs incurred = &#8364;15,712.</p><p><br />  15. Working Group on Efficiency Measures in the Circuit Court and District Court was established in November 2011 at the request of both the Chief Justice and of myself.  A number of changes have already been introduced and its work continues.  There are no additional costs associated with the establishment of this group.</p><p>16. Working Group on the establishment of the new, enhanced Human Rights and Equality Commission was appointed on 6 October 2011 to advise me on this extremely important matter.  The Group completed its work in April 2012 and its report was published on 19 April 2012.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b> There are no costs associated with the establishment of this group.</p><p><br />  For his information, I would remind the Deputy that the term &quot;quango&quot; is an acronym which stands for &quot;quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations&quot;.  No non-governmental organisations fall under the remit of my Department.  Finally, the Deputy might wish to note that new groups/committees set up since I came into office were established for very specific reasons such as dealing with complex issues that require consultation with a range of stakeholders and in which it is anticipated that the outcome will be in the public interest, achieving savings or cost reductions for my Department and agencies or responding to requirements under Ireland's international commitments in, for example, the area of human rights.</p></reply>

The term &quot;quango&quot; is an acronym which stands for &quot;quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations&quot;.  No non-governmental organisations fall under the remit of my Department.  I wish to inform the Deputy that the information requested regarding the cost of agencies under my Department's aegis is available on pages 85-104 of the 2012 Revised Estimates for Public Services and can be accessed via the following link .  I understand that the 2012 Revised Estimates for Public Services is also available in the Houses of the Oireachtas library.</p><p><br />  As the Deputy is aware, the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan, which was published in November 2011.  This streamlining includes the rationalisation of 48 bodies by the end of 2012, as well as the critical review of a further 46 bodies to take place by the end of June 2012.  Details of the bodies involved are set out in Appendices IIa and IIb of the Plan which can be found at: .  While these rationalisations will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater accountability, less duplication of effort and more transparent lines of responsibility of public servants.  It is not possible at this time to specify anticipated savings on an individual State body basis.  However, the Public Service Reform Plan indicated that across the public service as a whole, savings of 20 million euro in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money are envisaged from the rationalisation programme.</p><p><br />  With regard to State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, the bodies which are to be rationalised, amalgamated or abolished during 2012 are:</p><p><b>Equality Tribunal </b>(Rationalise the industrial relations / employee rights institutions &#8211; Labour Court, Labour Relations Commission, Employee Appeals Tribunal, National Employment Rights Authority, and  Equality Tribunal into single agency).  The purpose of the Equality Tribunal is to deal with all complaints of discrimination in employment and access to goods and services under the terms of equality legislation.</p><p><b>Equality Authority, Human Rights Commission </b>(Merge to form new Human Rights and Equality Commission).<b></b> The purpose of the Equality Authority is to ensure that all people in the country are treated equally and to ensure that discrimination on certain grounds does not occur.  The Authority provides information to the public on the equality legislation and it can, at its discretion, provide legal assistance to people who wish to bring claims of unlawful discrimination.  The Irish Human Rights Commission works to promote and protect human rights in Ireland.  The General Scheme of a Bill to replace the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission with a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was published on 5 June 2012.  The Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is intended to have the legislation in place by the end of 2012.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p><br />  With regard to State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality, the bodies which are subject to critical review in 2012 are:</p><p><b>Property Services Regulatory Authority </b>(Merge with the Private Residential Tenancies Board).  The purpose of the Property Services Regulatory Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents. </p><p><b>Reception and Integration Agency, Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner &amp; Refugee Appeals Tribunal </b>(Rationalise various Refugee structures).  The purpose of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is to accommodate asylum seekers in RIA accommodation centres while their applications for asylum are processed and to coordinate the provision of services to asylum seekers in RIA accommodation.  The purpose of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is to investigate applications from persons seeking a declaration for refugee status and to issue appropriate recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The purpose of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is to decide appeals of those asylum seekers whose applications for refugee status has not been recommended by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</p><p><b>Property Registration Authority </b>(Merge the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority).  The purpose of the Property Registration Authority is to act as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland.</p><p><b>Office of the Data Protection Commissioner </b>(Amalgamate Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with the Office of the Ombudsman).  The purpose of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is to protect the individual's right to privacy by enabling people to know, and to exercise control over how their personal information is used, in accordance with the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2001.</p><p><b>Prison Visiting Committees </b>(Reduce or merge Visiting Committees as there is now a Prisons Inspectorate).  A prison visiting committee is appointed to each prison and the committee&#8217;s function is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison to which it is appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner.</p><p><b>Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests </b>(Subsume Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests into proposed Office of the Charities Regulator).  The purpose of the Commissioners is to provide a variety of services to charities of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature in accordance with legislation governing charities.</p><p><b>Forensic Science Laboratory </b>(Merge Forensic Science Laboratory into State Laboratory).  The purpose of the Forensic Science Laboratory is to assist in the investigation of crime and serve the administration of justice by providing scientific analysis and objective expert evidence to international standards.  The services of the Laboratory are geared mainly to the requirements of the criminal justice system, chiefly the criminal courts of justice and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well some other State organisations involved in the investigation of criminal matters. </p><p><br />  With respect to the bodies under the aegis of my Department which are subject to critical review during 2012, it will be a matter for the Government to decide how to proceed in each case, having regard to the outcomes of the critical review process.</p></reply>

The Visa Waiver Programme is aimed at tourists and business travellers to the UK who might wish to include a trip to Ireland in their overall travel plans.  Under the programme, holders of certain types of short stay UK visas who have already been cleared to land by the UK's border control personnel may travel onwards to Ireland without the need to apply for a separate Irish visa.  The programme applies to citizens of sixteen countries (soon to be extended to seventeen) mainly from Asia (including China and India), the former Soviet Union and the Gulf and Middle East regions all of which are regarded as key development markets for Irish business and tourism interests.  The programme has been widely welcomed by the business and tourism sectors as an aid to developing important overseas markets.</p><p><br />  To qualify for the Immigrant Investor Programme the migrant must make an investment of a designated type, ranging from a &#8364;2m specially created low interest Government Bond, a capital investment in an Irish business that creates or protects jobs to a &#8364;500,000 endowment in the cultural, sporting educational or health areas.  Investment in property may also qualify in certain cases.  The Start-up Entrepreneur Programme provides that migrants with a good business idea in the innovation economy and funding of &#8364;75,000 can be given residency in this State for the purposes of developing their business.  Both the Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme are now operational and the first approval letters issued in the past couple of weeks.  There is a significant level of ongoing enquiry in the programmes.</p><p><b><i>Legal Costs</i></b></p><p><br />  I also wish to inform the Deputy that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which will modernise and open up the provision of legal services while providing a more transparent legal costs regime, was published within the exceptional EU/IMF/ECB Programme deadline which applied for the end of Quarter 3 of 2011.  Earlier this year the Bill completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Important progress has been made in the development of the Bill and this work continues including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel.  The aim is to commence Committee Stage before the end of this year with a view to the Bill's enactment in 2013.</p><p><b><i>JobBridge</i></b></p><p><br />  I can inform the Deputy that as part of the Programme for Government my Department is actively engaging in the Government's new jobs activation programme the National Internship Scheme &#8211; JobBridge.  This scheme provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  The aim is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  The Department has already advertised some 37 separate internship opportunities across a range of vocational areas including the legislative area, statistics, procurement, customer relations and general administration.  There are currently 33 individuals on placements across the Department.</p><p><br />  The Department cannot offer full-time employment at the end of an internship period, however, we do provide significant and in some cases challenging job experience opportunities to persons in need of such opportunities and better prepare them for either re-entry to the jobs market or a change in job direction.</p><p><b><i>Data Protection</i></b></p><p><br />  The  Office of the Data Protection Commissioner as the data protection regulator has no direct role in relation to job creation.  However, given that data protection, in light of developments at EU level, is now viewed as an issue of Board level strategic importance in multinationals the Office and the Commissioner have made themselves available on an ongoing basis to the IDA, companies established here and companies considering establishing here to explain data protection requirements.  It is understood that this assisted in relation to investment decisions for such companies.</p></reply>

My Department also re-tendered in 2010 for the provision of taxi services and the contract was awarded to a new provider which has resulted in further savings.  In addition, the  Department has made use of two official vehicles which can be configured as the need arises for use as people carriers or for carrying materials.  The use of these vehicles not only assists in the efficient discharge of Departmental business but has also given rise to significant savings in taxi costs which would otherwise be required in the absence of such a facility.<b> </b> The Departmental policy is that taxis may only be used by staff for business reasons where absolutely essential and where public transport or other cheaper alternatives are either not available or are not viable.</p></reply>

One of the consequences of that decision was that the transport arrangements in place for Ministers of State became applicable to Government Ministers, subject to very limited exceptions on security grounds.  In addition, it was decided that former Presidents and Taoisigh would only be supplied with official transport for important State occasions. The revised transport arrangements came into operation for Government Ministers on 1st May 2011 and for former Office Holders on 16th June 2011.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote.  In that context, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost of providing Office Holder transport for the period 1 March 2011 to July 2012 was approximately &euro;4,831,057.   This figure includes costs associated with the service prior to and after the new transport arrangements had been fully introduced.</p></reply>

Public and private sector fleet operators were also asked to participate in the initiative by circulating employees with the key message to slow down<b> </b>  and, whether driving for business or private purposes, to always drive within the speed and at a speed appropriate to the prevailing conditions.</p><p>The operation consisted of high visibility speed enforcement activities on both national primary and secondary roads.

The new legislation provides for the establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) to licence, control and regulate Property Services Providers (i.e. auctioneers/estate agents, letting agents and management agents). The new PSRA licensing system came into effect on 6 July 2012.</p><p><br />  Under the 2011 Act, any person wishing to engage in the provision of property services must obtain a licence from the PSRA. A person providing a property service without a licence is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p><p><br />  The types of property services for which a licence is required are: the auction of property other than land; the purchase or sale, by whatever means of land (including buildings or structures on land); the letting of land (including buildings or structures on land), or; property management services.</p><p>A comprehensive <b><i>Guide to Becoming a Licensed Property Services Provider</i></b>   was published in June 2012 and sent to every person holding a licence under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973. This guide is also available on the Authority's website www.psr.ie.</p><p><br />  At present the PSRA is engaged in the processing of some 5,000 licence applications. To date all applications have been acknowledged, and applicants who were lawfully providing the property service which is the subject of the application prior to 6 July 2012 have been informed that they may continue to provide such service pending a determination of their application. </p><p><br />  As the licensing system now being introduced is extremely comprehensive, and is being extended to cover employees as well as employers, the amount of data which must be recorded in respect of each individual is quite extensive. It is important that great care is taken to ensure that all applicants' particulars are correct and verified at this stage. Once this initial data capture is complete the renewal of licences in future years will be a much more streamlined process.</p><p><br />  Specifically in relation to new persons wishing to become a property services provider, it is of course, open to them to make an application to the PSRA for a licence. However, the transitional provisions which relate to persons who previously were lawfully providing a property service would not apply in such cases. Therefore such persons should not provide a property service unless they have received a licence from the PSRA. </p></reply>

More generally, legislation relating to sexual offences usually provides for the maximum sentence to be imposed. In some cases, special provisions apply. For example, an offence by a person in authority is effectively treated as an aggravating factor in the case of certain sexual offences against children. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of the presiding judge to determine the sentence to be imposed in a particular case having heard all the evidence presented, and taking case law, including appeals, into account. This allows the court to weigh all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Also, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against a sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient. </p><p>  The Government is committed to a strategic review of penal policy, including sentencing, and I expect this review to get underway shortly.  In addition, the Law Reform Commission is reviewing the law on mandatory sentences and published a consultation paper in January this year. The Commission invited submissions on its consultation paper from interested parties and will publish its final report in due course.  I will await the outcome of both these reviews and consider the recommendations made before taking any further action regarding the law on sentencing.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may know the Garda S&iacute;ochan&aacute; has a system in place for the monitoring of all persons subject to the notification requirements. The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit monitors and manages the notification provisions and maintains all information relating to persons who have obligations under the Act. As soon as this Unit is advised by a relevant authority of the impending release or movement of a sex offender this information is immediately passed to the nominated Garda Inspector with responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the notification requirements in their area.</p><p>  My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences and a review of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, including a public consultation process, formed an integral part of that examination. Arising from the review, I expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including a number of amendments to the 2001 Act, in the coming months. Legislative proposals being considered include measures for the electronic tagging of convicted sex offenders in specific circumstances, measures to strengthen the current notification requirements (for the purposes of the sex offenders' register) and changes with regard to civil sex offender orders to make it easier to apply to court for such an order. </p><p>  Regarding the introduction of measures similar to &quot;Megan's Law&quot; in the US, our primary objective must be to minimise the risk posed to the public. The High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on sex offenders was of the view that, if the Garda&iacute; have reason to believe a particular high risk offender poses a real and immediate danger, they should be free to tell individuals who need to know. Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable. In exceptional circumstances, the provision of appropriate information to members of the public is already possible. Currently, this is done on an administrative basis but, subject to Government approval, I intend to put these arrangements on a statutory footing.       </p><p>  However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders. General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society. </p></reply>

This was done on 2 July 2012 and issued to the person concerned on 11 July 2012. It was also copied to the legal representative on record.  Judicial Review proceedings were initiated on 18 July 2012. As the matter is, therefore, sub judice I do not propose to comment further.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The prisoner referred to made a complaint to Portlaoise Prison management regarding the lack of wheelchair access to the C block visiting area.  Following the complaint, wheelchair accessible ramps were installed outside the entrance to the visiting area and alterations were made in the main open visiting area on the ground floor to allow one wheelchair user access to the visiting box counter.  I am informed that this work was inspected by the Irish Wheelchair Association who were satisfied with the level of access provided.</p><p>  A complaint was also made that his father was refused entry to the visiting area while accompanying his mother.  I am informed that this was for security reasons.  In such instances visitors are given the option of having a screened visit or rescheduling their visit.  The screened visiting boxes in Portlaoise Prison are located on the first floor of the visiting area and there is no lift available.  However, at all such times the alternative option of rescheduling the visit remained.  When resources allow, the provision of wheelchair access to the screened visits area in the C block of Portlaoise Prison will be examined by the Irish Prison Service. In the interim, the visiting area in the A block may be used should a similar situation arise in the future as the screened visiting area in this area is on the ground floor.</p><p>  A further complaint was made in July 2012 that his mother requested to use toilet facilities in the visiting area but found that the door was locked and she could not gain access. The reason for the unavailability of these facilities was explained to the prisoner at the time.  These toilet facilities are not generally open to visitors as management became aware that they were being used for the retrieval of contraband that had been concealed internally.   However, a procedure has been put in place to ensure that access to this toilet facility is permitted on request to the Assistant Chief Officer in charge of visits who has possession of the key. </p></reply>

It is understood that the individual referred to by the Deputy is a citizen of the United States of America.  As such, he does not require a visa to travel to Ireland, but is subject to the usual immigration control provisions which apply to everybody who arrives in Ireland irrespective of nationality. Section 4 (2) of the Immigration Act 2004 provides that a non-national coming by air or sea from a place outside the state shall, on arrival in the state, present himself or herself to an Immigration Officer for permission to land or be in the state. Section 4(3) of the Immigration Act sets out the eleven grounds on which a person may be refused entry to the State.</p><p>  I understand that in this case, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) have made direct contact with the promoters of the proposed event and explained to them the requirements in respect of entry to the State and, as it may be relevant to this case, our obligations in respect of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Accordingly, the person concerned should now make a formal written renewal request to my Department, c/o the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INIS), PO Box 10003, Dublin 1. Upon receipt of such renewal application, the case of the person concerned will be examined by the relevant officials in my Department.

The purpose of the code is to enhance the clarity and accessibility of the criminal law.  It is not intended to provide for substantive law reform.  A draft partial code was prepared by the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee and published on my Department's website on 23 June 2011.</p><p>  While I am favourably disposed towards the concept of codification, I have to have regard to the fact that enactment of a criminal code would involve a substantial legislative programme over a number of years which has implications for the use of scarce State resources.  Having reviewed the project in the light of the current constraints facing the Government, I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly in relation to the project.  An announcement will be made after the Government has considered the matter.</p></reply>

Critics of these closures are in effect arguing that we should not close even one single Garda station - currently there are 664 - despite the revolution that has taken place in transport, communications and technology across the country.</p><p>  The Garda Commissioner is currently engaged in an assessment of the potential for further efficiencies in the structure and organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the preparation of the draft policing plan for 2013. This plan is due to be submitted to me by the end of October this year and I expect that it will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts. In the meantime it would be premature, in advance of its submission, to speculate on specific measures which it might contain.</p><p>  While this assessment will be based on an evaluation of the policing needs of present day Ireland, policing arrangements in comparable jurisdictions can provide useful perspective.  In that regard there are many clear points of similarity as between Ireland and Scotland.</p></reply>

Lisbrook direct provision accommodation centre in Galway is part of RIA's portfolio of direct provision accommodation.</p><p>  RIA made a decision to close the Lisbrook accommodation centre on the expiry of its 18 month contract with its operator. This was done principally for two reasons; to enable RIA to remain on budget this year and subsequent years and a reflection of the fact that the demand for RIA services has fallen sharply. At the end of 2010, RIA was accommodating 6,107 persons. At 9 September, 2012 this figure had reduced to 4,996 persons, a decline of 1,111 persons or 18%. This year alone there has been a drop of 8% in the number of persons in direct provision accommodation. The decline in 2012 is part of a continuing trend and it should be noted that, in the period 2009 to date, RIA has reduced its accommodation portfolio from 60 centres to 36.  In relation to budgetary issues, RIA like all Department of Justice and Equality bodies must operate in a significantly lower financial envelope and cannot countenance an overspend or the continuation of contracts which may no longer be required. In this context it should be noted that the actual budget of RIA declined by &euro;28 million in the period 2008 to 2012.</p><p>  In the light of representations received primarily expressing concern about the dislocation of school-going children, I have asked for a review of the background circumstance of the decision to close the centre.  Therefore, arrangements for the transfer of residents from Lisbrook accommodation centre have been suspended, pending further consideration of a number of issues, including the impact on school children of such a closure, as well as the broader financial restrictions within which RIA must operate, as well as the need for it to manage its diminishing budget efficiently in the current critical economic situation.</p><p>  As part of any planned accommodation centre closure, RIA does work to retain as many families as possible in the same catchment area for schools, and for those residents who are linked to critical medical services locally. This practice was underway at Lisbrook as part of any planned closure. The review exercise now being undertaken on the non-renewal of the contract is aimed at striking a balance between budget realities and the reasonable need of individuals, families and children, in particular at the start of the school year.</p></reply>

We should be clear, of course, that these so-called 'dissident republicans' are no more than criminal terrorists using violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends.  </p><p>  We should also always remember that these groups maintain more than just a nodding acquaintance with organised criminals in funding themselves and their activities.  Indeed, these paramilitaries are deeply involved in criminal activities. Countering the threat from terrorists has always been a priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and nothing has changed in that regard.  Despite the positive developments there have been in recent years in the North, the Garda&iacute; have never let up in their efforts to counteract these groups. </p><p>  I am not of course going to comment on details of Garda operational matters nor on security related measures. Nevertheless in relation to the incidents mentioned by the Deputy, it must be accepted that the Garda members present, in taking appropriate operational decisions had, above all else, a particular responsibility to ensure the safety of the public in what was a crowded environment.  I do not discount the possibility that there may have been an effort to provoke the Garda&iacute; into taking action with a view to generating public disorder and greater publicity for those involved.  </p><p>  In light of these events, the Garda Commissioner has set up a dedicated operation, &ldquo;Operation Ambience&rdquo;.  As a result, over 30 searches were conducted of various locations in Dublin and surrounding counties and a substantial number of arrests were also made.  Three people have been charged with membership of an unlawful organisation under the Offences Against the State Act and Garda inquiries into the matter are ongoing.</p><p>  I am strongly committed to ensure that the Garda&iacute; have the necessary resources they need, not just in terms of manpower and equipment, but also in terms of legislative provisions, to bear down on these paramilitary groups.  I am also committed to making sure that there is seamless cooperation between the security services North and South in dealing with the threat.  That is exactly what is happening.</p></reply>

He has explained that information is still being identified which has the capacity to add to the overall outcome of the Committee&rsquo;s work in a meaningful way, and the Committee feels that it would be improper to conclude without examining this additional material.  </p><p>  I am conscious of the need to progress matters as quickly as possible but it is important to emphasise that we are in a process which is seeking to fully establish the facts.  I am not going to pre-empt the work of the Committee by making decisions on such matters before I receive the final report.</p></reply>

While this represents a very significant commitment on the part of Government, at this strength level it was not possible to maintain the then organisational structure of the Defence Forces, which had been designed to support a serving strength of 11,500. As a result, I tasked the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff to conduct a detailed review of the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces and to bring forward proposals on an appropriate organisation for a Defence Forces of 9,500 serving personnel which could continue to deliver the services required by Government.</p><p>  In July 2012, I announced details of the re-organisation. The re-organisation includes a reduction in the number of PDF personnel working full time with the Army Reserve (known as the Cadre) to a total of 48. As the re-organisation of the PDF primarily impacted the Army, no decisions have been made, as yet, regarding PDF Cadre with the Naval Service.</p><p>  While the re-organisation impacts numbers of PDF personnel available for the administration and support for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF), the organisation of the RDF itself has not been addressed. Decisions in relation to the organisation of the RDF will be made following the completion of the Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force, which is due to be finalised in the next few weeks.</p></reply>

Legislation is currently being drafted to dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions of the Board back into the Department of Defence. The transfer of the functions of the Civil Defence Board back into the Department of Defence is expected to realise savings in running costs of approximately &euro;60,000 per annum. I appointed the current Board as an interim measure from 2011.  In this context, none of the positions were advertised.</p><p>Membership of the interim Board appointed from 2011 is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Name</b></th><th><b>Nominating Bodies</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Civil Defence Board Chairperson</b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain<br />Director, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td><b>Civil Defence Board Members</b></td><td><b></b><br /><b></b></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy<br />Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan<br />Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney<br />Principal Officer, Department of Defence</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Bill Smith<br />Director General, Civil Defence Board</td><td>Appointed as Director General, Civil Defence Board</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson<br />County Manager, Limerick City Council</td><td>Nominated by City &amp; County Managers Association</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard<br />Assistant Fire Advisor</td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty</td><td>Nominated by Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Becci Cantrell</td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde<br />Assistant Civil Defence Officer</td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers Association</td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011, and I have since appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position could not be advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</p><p>The chairperson and the civilian doctor are entitled to annual fees of &euro;7,618 and &euro;5,079 respectively.</p><p>Coiste an Asgard was the company set up to manage the National Sail Training Scheme. In September 2008, the company&rsquo;s sail training vessel &lsquo;Asgard II&rsquo; sank in the Bay of Biscay. In December 2009, the previous Government announced that the National Sail Training Scheme was to be discontinued and the funding for 2010 was cancelled. Up to and including 2009, the company had been receiving funding from the National Lottery of approximately &euro;800,000 per annum.</p><p>The Company has been inactive since and there are no crew or staff left on the payroll. The winding-up process is well advanced and it is anticipated that the company will be in a position to close by the end of this year, following a final audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. There is no remuneration attached to membership of the Board of Coiste an Asgard.</p><p>No new agencies, authorities, committees, working groups, tribunals, council services, task forces, or quangos have been established since February 2011.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government sets out that we will take steps to ensure that all State Boards have at least 40% of each gender.  The principal function of the Army Pensions Board under the Army Pensions Acts is to investigate applications for pensions, allowances and gratuities arising from the death or disablement of members of the Defence Forces in the course of their military service. The Army Pensions Board comprises 3 members: a chairman, a civilian medical doctor and an officer of the Army Medical Corps. There has been one appointment to the Army Pensions Board since February 2011. The Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, and I appointed a male officer to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011 on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.</p><p>There have been no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard since 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. There are 9 members remaining on the Board, which will be dissolved shortly.  The Civil Defence Act 2002 provides that the Board shall consist of at least eight but not more than 14 members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence. Legislation is currently being drafted to dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions of the Board back into the Department of Defence. I appointed the current Board as an interim measure from 2011. The gender ratio of the interim Board is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government regarding gender balance on State Boards.</p></reply>

I believe that this is the optimum strength required to fulfil all roles currently assigned by Government. The Military Authorities have advised that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 August 2012, the latest date for which details are available, was 8,838 comprising 7,152 Army, 753 Air Corps and 933 Naval Service.</p><p>  As the Permanent Defence Force is currently below the agreed serving cadre there will be an intake in 2012 of approximately 600 personnel consisting primarily of the phased recruitment of general service recruits and an intake of 37 Cadets.  The Cadets will commence their training in the Defence Forces Training Centre on 1 October 2012.  It is proposed that the enlistment of general service recruits will take place over three tranches, before the end of the year, commencing on 24 September 2012.  To date in 2012, 50 recruits have been enlisted of whom 21 are Instrumentalists.  In addition a Medical Officer was appointed in July and a Military Judge in September 2012.  In addition an Air Corps Apprentice Competition will be advertised shortly from which it is proposed to enlist 20 personnel.  All recruitment will be achieved within the resource envelope allocated to Defence so as to maintain the Government approved strength of the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.</p><p>  Recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is ongoing.  The current budgetary provision provides for approximately 30,000 paid training man-days. In 2011 and 2012, I sanctioned paid training man-days to include support for the training of new recruits to the RDF.  This was sufficient to train approximately 400 recruits during 2011 and 2012. The Military Authorities currently manage recruitment in this context.  A Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the recommendations arising from this review will inform future plans, including recruitment, for the Reserve.</p></reply>

This examination has been completed but it showed that there has been an overpayment on the file to all the applicants who are party to this contract. The overpayment is as a result of the Forest Service determining that, instead of the 107.78 hectares originally claimed, payment was due only on 101.6 hectares. An overpayment was therefore made in respect of 6.18 hectares over and above the payable area determined by the Forest Service. On 4th   September 2012, all the applicants were informed of the details of the overpayment and of the exact amount consequently owed by each of them to the Department. They were also informed that no further payments will issue in respect of this contract until the matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Forest Service.</p></reply>

The Regulation also adopts rules on compulsory labelling where the origin or place of provenance of a food is given and where it is not the same as its primary ingredient.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.<b></b>  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals. According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010/2011. Imports of cereals in that period amounted to 938,000 tonnes, down 14% or 155,000 tonnes on the previous year. </p><p><br />  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies. In 2010, increased demands for grain from the biofuels sector and the growing needs of new emerging markets like China and India drove up world grain market prices. In line with this rise in world prices, grain prices in Ireland increased and growers here reacted by increasing the acreage sown. This resulted in a bumper harvest in 2011 with total grain production of almost 2.5m tonnes. The preliminary estimate for the 2012 grain harvest is forecast to be lower than the record harvest of 2011 due to the persistent adverse weather during the growing season.  </p><p><br />  However, the latest Teagasc report estimates the total grain production may come in, in the region of 2.3 million tonnes, boosted by a significant increase in cereal area planted in 2011.  This is somewhat above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes but 9% lower than the 2011 harvest figure of 2.5 million tonnes, which was exceptionally high. </p><p><br />  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. </p><p><br />  Ireland is also a significant importer of field vegetables and potato sector.  Most of my Department&#8217;s efforts along with that of the State Agencies involved with the horticultural industry is mainly focused on increasing production for the domestic market.  The opportunities for developing exports, with the exception perhaps in the case of potatoes,  is very limited.  The main reason for this is due to scale of the industry, our costs of production, competition from major suppliers around the world and the controls exercised by the supermarkets in the importing countries. Also the very difficult weather conditions over the past 5 years, including 2 very severe winters, plus the very disappointing summer weather this year, have further restricted the industry&#8217;s capacity to even think of expanding production.</p></reply>

The FH2020 Implementation Committee took an active interest in the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs and they monitored the 17 inter-agency projects included by this Department and relevant agencies in the 2012 AJP. </p><p>  These and the other 215 recommendation in FH 2020 are largely capacity building measures which are directed at supporting and improving the employment potential of this sector.  As such they do not readily lend themselves to annualised job targets. Indeed, the FH2020 report recognised that the greatest scope for employment gains would flow from the increased output in the dairy and aquaculture sectors.  These productivity gains will be in medium term, as the abolition of milk quotas will not arise until 2015 and work remains to be done to ensure that aquaculture developments comply with national and EU environmental legislative guidelines. In that regard, a recent academic analysis by a working group, established by the Food Harvest implementation committee, suggested that the growth in the agri-food sector envisaged under FH2020 could realistically generate around 25,000 additional direct and indirect jobs by 2020.</p><p>   Nevertheless, some progress has been made on stemming the previous decade&rsquo;s job losses of around 1,500. The CSO estimates for food and beverage manufacturing show a welcome rise in employment levels.  Their data, based on the National Quarterly Household Survey, indicates that employment numbers have increased from 43,900 in Q1 2010, 46,000 in Q1 2011 to 50,300 in Q1 2012.  </p><p>  This Department did not have a specific involvement in the Jobs Initiative which was primarily directed at fiscal and labour activation measures and while Budget 2012 contained a number of agriculture related taxation measures, these are primarily aimed at improving competitiveness and stimulating investment rather than at direct employment creation. </p></reply>

Payments under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme (DAS) will be made in September. REPS payments in respect of 2011 are up to date and AEOS payments are well advanced and continue to issue as quickly as possible.

Teagasc has statutory responsibility for the delivery of education, advisory and research services to the agriculture sector. It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities. Ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</p><p>  I am aware that Teagasc is currently implementing a major &lsquo;Change Programme&rsquo;to improve efficiencies, streamline services and promote greater integration across the organisation. As part of this Programme, Teagasc has decided to streamline the existing network of advisory offices in order to concentrate the delivery of services at fewer centres. This decision is entirely a matter for Teagasc and its Board. </p><p>  I understand from Teagasc that on average, clients visit an advisory office 1.5 times per year. It is their experience that farmers tend to gravitate much more readily to other centres for public events such as seminars, farm walks, demonstrations and information meetings. They have also invested significant resources in rolling out Discussion Groups where groups of farmers visit similar farms and share information and experiences in dialogue facilitated by their Teagasc adviser.  Teagasc is committed to the delivery   of high quality advisory services to farmers and will still retain a significant network of advisory offices throughout the country when the rationalisation programme is completed.</p></reply>

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  </p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed met the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  </p><p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.    The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.  </p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding/Management Plan for the fishery.  The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.  </p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level. </p></reply>

Only those GMO&rsquo;s deemed safe by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for use as food and feed and also safe to the environment are authorised for use in the European Union.</p><p>  Within Ireland the issue of genetic modification is dealt with by three Government Departments, as follows:</p><p>- GM foods come under the Minister for Health and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; </p><p>- GM feeds and the Coexistence of authorised GM crops alongside non-GM crops rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; while,</p><p>- Approval to trial GM crops or authorise new GM crops for deliberate release into the environment rests with the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Environment, Community and Local Government; </p><p>  Accordingly, my Department&rsquo;s sole responsibility with regard to the cultivation of GM crops is in relation to coexistence measures in the event that commercial GM crops are grown alongside conventional crops.</p><p>  Given that GM crops are not cultivated commercially in Ireland and are unlikely to be for the foreseeable future, the issue of cultivation and coexistence does not arise at present.  In relation to the authorisation and use of products consisting of or containing authorised GM ingredients in animal feed, my Department adopts, on the basis of scientific evaluation, a positive but precautionary approach to EU applications for the authorisation of GM ingredients in food and feed and supports applications which have been deemed to be safe by EFSA.  </p><p>  In regard to the recent application to the EPA by Teagasc to carry out field trials on a genetically modified potato, with improved resistance to late potato blight, it must be pointed out that these trials do not constitute cultivation of a commercial crop and that under the EPA consent attached to this approval, they will be subject to strict conditions with regular monitoring and reporting to the EPA for compliance.  I understand that Polish proposals on the GMO MON810 refer to planting of the crop only and have yet to be ratified.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.3731.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRDDDD02700"><p>The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures aimed at eradicating TB from the cattle population in Ireland through testing and the control of cattle movements in order to prevent the spread of disease. More specifically, the programme provides for the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the implementation of a range of supplementary tests and the restriction of herds where TB is disclosed or suspected. </p><p>  The eradication programme is reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department in light of experience and research. Following a review conducted on the programme last year, my Department introduced a number of changes in order to ensure that the programme addressed all potential sources of infection and to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds. These changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are, firstly, based on research which demonstrate that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and, secondly, are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals. </p><p>  With regard to the Contiguous testing programme, herdowners whose herds are adjoining a holding where a high risk TB breakdown has been disclosed, usually involving more than one reactor, are required to have their herd tested if it has not been tested within the preceding 4 months. I should clarify that herds which adjoin a herd where a doubtful reactor has been disclosed are not included in a contiguous testing programme. The only change which my Department has made to the contiguous testing arrangements is that herds adjoining a high risk breakdown are now being trade restricted, except to slaughter, pending a TB test. Previously, such herds were permitted to sell cattle on the open market prior to carrying out the test and research had shown that this posed a risk to clear herds. Research has shown the TB risk relating to animals that move out of herds which have been identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high risk TB breakdown is almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test. The objective of the restriction is to protect clear herds from buying in infected animals from these herds and thereby avoid the situation where a clear herd that buys in infected cattle is required to carry out a minimum of 2 herd tests and is restricted for 4 months. </p><p>  With regard to the four month testing interval, the choice of four months as the benchmark period under this programme has been part of the contiguous testing programme for the past 30 years. The four month period is related to the time interval from when an animal may be exposed to infection and the expectation that a test will give a positive result, if the animal is infected. In line with the new procedures relating to overdue tests, it is open to herd owners who have a genuine reason for delaying the contiguous test to get in contact with my Department and the test can be deferred for up to one month without penalty. I would also emphasise that staff in my regional offices will always be available to discuss, with any affected herd owner, the particular circumstances relating to their herd. </p><p>  I believe that the restriction on contiguous herds pending a test should have a very limited effect on trade in cattle. In effect, it is only those herds in which TB is disclosed that will be restricted for any significant period of time. Finally, I would underline that the primary objective of the restriction is to reduce the risk that farmer purchasers of animals will unknowingly buy a potentially infected animal from a higher risk herd.  </p></reply>

Increasing feed prices in 2012 are primarily a function of poor weather conditions in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and the Ukraine. The expected shortage in cereals comes on top of relatively poor harvests in recent years, a growing world population and a rising middle class in China. Thus there is a rising demand for animal feed and animal feed based products at a time when supplies are short. </p><p>  Increasing feed prices are an issue for all meat sectors, but in Ireland are felt most acutely in the pig and poultry sectors, where feed costs represent some 70% of the overall cost of production. Against this background, producers have in recent years taken measures to increase feed efficiency and output per unit.  In the pig sector, increases in feed prices are partly offset by high pigmeat prices. For the week ending 9th   September the Irish average price per 100kgs was &euro;166.02, compared to &euro;147.63 in the same week in 2011. This represents a 12.46% increase. </p><p>  The production model in the poultry meat sector in Ireland is quite different to that in the pigmeat sector, with a high degree of vertical integration between processors, who supply stock, feed and other inputs, and growers, who typically provide housing and capital equipment and who rear the stock to slaughter age. In this sector the prices paid to growers depend on contractual arrangements with the processors. EU market statistics published last month suggest that broiler prices across the EU are marginally higher than in 2011, while CSO statistics for July suggest that output prices are 20.6% higher than last year. </p><p>  My Department and its agencies have supported both the pigmeat and poultry sectors through the provision of capital investment grants to assist in compliance with welfare regulations, through Bord Bia&rsquo;s promotional campaigns and through the development and operation of the Bord Bia Pigmeat and Poultry Quality Assurance Programmes (PQAS), which are a critical component in consolidating the position of Irish product on the domestic market. </p><p>  In so far as international trade is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future. For example, during my trade mission to China earlier this year I raised the issue of market access for both pigmeat and poultry, and I hope that this engagement will ultimately deliver a considerable return for the Irish pig and poultry sectors. </p><p>  In the context of CAP post 2013, I will continue to press for the retention of flexible market support schemes which can be deployed as a safety net when circumstances require, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility. Indeed the Aid to Private Storage Scheme introduced for pigmeat in 2011 played a significant role in putting a floor under pigmeat prices at that time. This, together with the release of cereal stocks from intervention, improved the situation somewhat last year. </p><p>  In addition, Teagasc, through its Moorepark Pig Research facility and the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, has played a critically important role in improving productive performance at farm level. </p><p>  Furthermore, my Department has hosted inspection visits from a number of other countries and negotiations are continuing with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets. And of course, Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the PQAS, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and Third Country markets. </p><p>  While I recognise that these are difficult times for these sectors, I am confident that, if all stakeholders work together,  their long-term future will be secure.</p></reply>

It is in farmers&rsquo; interests therefore to soil sample because if analysis results show a lower Index then the farmer is allowed to use more phosphorus.</p></reply>

The following were the categories under which farmers could apply for derogation: <b>Category 1</b>  :  Farmers with a lower stocking density as a result of adherence to an agri-environment of similar type of plan; <b>Category 2</b>  : Farmers, who are not subject to the restrictions from a stocking density point of view of plans referred to under Category 1 above, but whose stocking levels were restricted by the poor land productivity and farming constraints; <b>Category 3</b>  : This Category is for farmers who took over a farm either immediately before or during 2011, where the previous owner died; <b>Category 4</b>  : This category is for farmers whose livestock were affected by an epizootic disease. An epizootic disease is any disease that affects a large number of animals in one place at one time; <b>Category 5</b>  : New Entrants; <b>Category 6</b>  : Miscellaneous, This category is for farmers who consider their particular circumstance is not covered in the categories set out above, e.g. farmers who were occupationally incapacitated as a result of an illness and/or hospitalisation. </p><p><br />  These derogation applications are currently being processed, each case being individually reviewed. Decision notifications, which have recently begun issuing, are being sent to each applicant. Those whose applications are successful are being advised that their 2012 DAS applications will be further processed for payment, subject to the other Terms and Conditions governing the 2012 Scheme. Those whose applications are unsuccessful are being afforded the right of appeal.</p><p><br />  In this regard, I have decided that an independent Appeals Committee, chaired by an independent Chairman, should be established to process appeals in relation to applicants whose applications for derogations have been unsuccessful.</p></reply>

The review, which was conducted at individual commonage parcel level, indicates both the minimum and the maximum livestock units that will have to be maintained in order for the commonage to be maintained in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). It is necessary that all commonage land be maintained in GAEC to be eligible for payment under the Single Payment Scheme, Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, REPS and Agri-Environment Options Scheme.</p><p>  Arrangements are now underway to notify applicants under the above mentioned Schemes of the minimum and maximum stocking levels now allowed in respect of the commonage land they declare. </p><p>  In relation to new entrants, the following provisions apply regarding the acquisition of commonage land.

However, if the right to use commonage is a grazing right, the grazing right cannot be legally detached from the enclosed (green land) to which it is appurtenant. Any applicant wishing to submit commonage that is not registered, as an undivided share must also have control of the green land to which it is appurtenant and be in a position to declare such green land on their application form. </p><p>  The stocking density requirements for each commonage parcel will be reviewed on an annual basis and provision will be made for new entrants, who are legally entitled to claim a share of the commonage. In addition, an existing shareholder, who may not have claimed his or her share of the commonage before or for some time will also be accommodated under the new requirements.</p></reply>

The proposed legislation will play a key role in protecting Ireland&rsquo;s image as a country which not only respects the welfare of its animals but also accords critical importance to animal health and biosecurity issues. The risks of animal disease have grown significantly since the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 due to greater movement of animals, animal products and people. </p><p>  There are no new charges foreseen in the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012. The Bill provides that any extension of the levies, as currently provided for under the relevant 1979 Act, would have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas by way of motion. Furthermore, the Bill only allows for charging of fees where there is a service rendered such as lab tests, inspection of a premises or processing an application for registration of premises or the like.</p></reply>

That system has continued since and was not changed in the CFP Reform&rsquo;s of 1992 or 2002. There is no support in the Council of Ministers for a change in the traditional quota allocations in the current Reform either and the Commission has not proposed any changes. </p><p>  Securing increased fish quotas for Ireland and enhanced fish landings into Ireland remains an objective , but must I believe be delivered within the structures in place. Ireland has been successful in recent years by working within the system, in securing a very significant two thirds share of the new and very large Boarfish Fishery. This fishery will permit Ireland to catch 56,666 tonnes of boarfish this year. </p><p>  The other way of increasing Irish fish catches and landings into Ireland is by growing the stocks on which we are dependant and which are proximate to Ireland. By growing stocks we increase our permitted volumes of landings, even within a fixed sharing arrangement. The quota increases secured in this way in the Celtic Sea this year are clear evidence of the gains that can be secured through this approach. </p><p>  There are many conservation vehicles in the context of the reform of the CFP which hold the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term, these include long term management plans of stocks, reducing and eliminating discards where possible and rebuilding stocks to Maximum Sustainable Yield.</p></reply>

In the region of 9,000 responded and these applications are currently being processed.  The following were the categories under which farmers could apply for derogation: <b>Category 1</b>  :  Farmers with a lower stocking density as a result of adherence to an agri-environment of similar type of plan; <b>Category 2</b>  : Farmers, who are not subject to the restrictions from a stocking density point of view of plans referred to under Category 1 above, but whose stocking levels were restricted by the poor land productivity and farming constraints; <b>Category 3</b>  : This Category is for farmers who took over a farm either immediately before or during 2011, where the previous owner died; <b>Category 4</b>  : This category is for farmers whose livestock were affected by an epizootic disease.  An epizootic disease is any disease that affects a large number of animals in one place at one time; <b>Category 5</b>  : New Entrants; <b>Category 6</b>  : Miscellaneous, This category is for farmers who consider their particular circumstance is not covered in the categories set out above, e.g. farmers who were occupationally incapacitated as a result of an illness and/or hospitalisation.</p><p><br />  These derogation applications are currently being processed, each case being individually reviewed. Decision notifications, which have recently begun issuing, are being sent to each applicant.  Those whose applications are successful are being advised that their 2012 DAS applications will be further processed for payment, subject to the other Terms and Conditions governing the 2012 Scheme.  Those whose applications are unsuccessful are being afforded the right of appeal.</p><p><br />  In this regard, I have decided that an independent Appeals Committee, chaired by an independent Chairman, should be established to process appeals in relation to applicants whose applications for derogations have been unsuccessful.</p></reply>

In 2007, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement against Ireland for a breach of the Birds Directive which is indicative of the seriousness of this issue and the need for full compliance with the relevant Directives.</p><p>To ensure compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives, all applications in &lsquo;Natura 2000 areas&rsquo; are required to be appropriately assessed.  This has required the putting in place of a significant work programme which has considerable time and resource implications.

This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.

Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds.  The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction.</p><p>  The last prosecution under the Act was taken in 1988.  However, my Department actively seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act by issuing notices to destroy in all instances where it becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds. A total of 35 such notices were issued in 2011 with a further 40 having been issued to date in 2012.  These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by Department field officers or on receipt of complaints made by the public.  Follow-up action may be undertaken by my officials with the landowner to ensure the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the notice to destroy.  Additionally, all recipients of notices to destroy in 2011 were contacted again this year reminding them of their obligations to control noxious weeds present on their lands.</p><p>  Under the EU single farm payment scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures of the scheme. Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements. In the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 penalties under the single payment were applied to 27, 31 and 46 farmers, respectively, for failure to take appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of noxious weeds.</p><p>  My Department continues to engage with all local authorities and the National Roads Authority to ensure a consistent programme of treatment and disposal of noxious weeds on roadsides on an ongoing basis. In that context my officials earlier this year wrote to Managers of each County and Local Authorities together with the National Roads Authority restating their statutory obligations under the Act and remaining them of the importance of implementing measures for the treatment and safe disposal of ragwort.</p></reply>

No. 230 of 2006) and the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 367 of 2007).  The complete ban for the commercial fishing of sea bass applies to Irish fishing vessels in all areas.  These regulations were introduced as a co-ordinated set of measures with the Sea Bass Fishing Conservation bylaws.  The bylaws imposes a bag limit on anglers of two bass in any one period of 24 hours and a ban on angling for bass during the spawning season, from 15th May to 15th June in any given year. </p><p>  These measures have been in place since 1990 and were introduced arising from the dramatic decline of sea bass stocks in the 1970&rsquo;s.  Bass in Irish waters are a slow growing fish and, at a recruitment age of roughly 5 years, are late maturing fish.  The distribution of bass around Europe is found mainly in southern waters, including the inshore waters of the south west of England and the English Channel.  It is farmed extensively in Mediterranean waters.</p><p>  The Marine Institute carried out an annual bass survey between the years 1996 and 2007.  This survey validates previous research on the species and indicates that the stock of bass in Ireland&rsquo;s inshore waters remains greatly depleted since the 1960s and 1970s.  In Irish waters, the available scientific advice is that the sea bass stock appears depleted and should be allowed to rebuild.  The evidence suggests that sea bass in Irish waters do not exhibit the same strong recruitments as recorded closer to continental Europe and the species abundance remains depressed.</p><p>  The EU Commission has indicated that it is considering introducing Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas for seabass in  specified fisheries management areas stretching from the North Sea down to waters off the coasts of Spain and Portugal.  The EU Commission has indicated that it proposes to use track record of landings of seabass by Member States fleets to establish each Member States shares of the TACs.  As Ireland has implemented a complete closure of the commercial seabass fishery since 1990, under this methodology it would not receive any quota.  I consider that it is unacceptable that the Irish fleet would not benefit from a share out of these fisheries because of the responsible approach taken to protect and rebuild the stock around  Ireland.  I have made the case at the Fisheries Council and to the Commission that an alternative method of establishing access to the fisheries should be developed that allows Irish fishermen fishing opportunities for sustainable stocks of seabass in areas where the Irish fleet would operate.  I will continue to press Ireland&rsquo;s case in this matter in the coming months and in the lead in to the December Fisheries Council , where the decisions on this matter will be finalised.  I will consider management arrangements for seabass when and if Council decides on TACs and quotas for the relevant stocks.</p></reply>

The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  There are 107 family resource centres throughout the country funded under the programme.  I understand that 12 FRCs have been established in Kerry under the Family Support Agency (FSA) programme.</p><p><br />  The centres provide a range of services for families and groups at local level.  These include information, education and training opportunities, childcare, breakfast, homework and after school clubs and services for young people at risk of substance abuse, for which funding is provided under programmes administered by several government departments and agencies.  Family Resource Centres have an important role to play, in harnessing local community efforts, in support of improved outcomes for children and young people which is a key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p><br />  Since the inception in September 2010 of the Kerry Children&#8217;s Services Committee (CSC), the Kerry Network of Family Resource Centres has, in recognition of the valuable work they undertake at community level with children, young people and families, been represented on the Kerry CSC.

These reports are published on the HSE website.  The latest published report shows that there were 6,248 children in State care in June 2012. 5,772 / 92.4% of these children had an allocated social worker.  In February 2011, there were 6,015 children in State care, of which 5,689 / 95% had an allocated social worker.</p><p>  The allocation of a social worker is prioritised by the HSE to ensure children entering or about to leave the care system, those in a residential care placement or those experiencing a change of placement always have a social worker assigned to them.  A principal social worker may decide to prioritise such cases over long term stable foster care placement where there is a temporary gap due, for example, to a social worker being unavailable because of extended leave or while a new appointment is awaited.  In such situations there may already be a HSE link worker (who is also a professional social worker) supervising and supporting the foster carers and visiting the placement and the foster carers and the child should have information on who to contact should an urgent need arise.</p><p>  These differences between care settings are evident from the data with much higher proportions of children in residential care (including special care and high support) having assigned social workers.  Over 95% of those in residential care have social workers assigned.  In general, those children in residential care tend to have higher levels of need compared to others such as those in long term foster care.</p><p>  Addressing this issue is a priority for the HSE and progress has been made in recent months.  Since the end of March 2012, the number of children in care without an assigned social worker has reduced from 507 to 476.  This was over a period when the overall number of children in care actually increased by 46.  In May 2012, 476 children or 7.6% did not have an allocated social worker.  In February 2011, 326 children or 5% did not have an allocated social worker.  In both January 2011 and March 2011 the percentage of children in care without a social worker was 6.3%, while previously significantly higher numbers of children in care did not have social workers assigned.  As recently as 2009, for example, some 17% of children in care did not have a social worker.  Of the 476 children without assigned social workers in May, 458 were in foster care or foster care with relatives.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent improvement and the more positive position in relation to residential care, efforts are required to bring about further improvements in this area.  The HSE&rsquo;s 2012 National Service Plan identifies this as a priority deliverable.  In this context the Government has made additional budgeting provision of &euro;19m for child welfare and protection services compared to the funding made available last year.  The funding will assist in addressing expenditure pressures from budgetary reductions made in previous years and growth and demand for services due to demographic and other factors.  In overall terms, the 2012 provision is designed to support the HSE in meeting its obligations with regard to the welfare and protection of children under the Child Care Act 1991, together with a range of priorities set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2012.  As mentioned, these priorities include improvement in relation to a reduction in the numbers of children in care without an assigned social worker.</p><p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the HSE to ensure that further progress is made over the remainder of the year in the key priorities set out in the National Service Plan.</p></reply>

The Adoption Authority has been proactive in developing relationships with its Hague counterparts around the world and this will continue.  The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries. </p><p>  The HSE has advised that waiting times for intercountry adoption assessments have reduced considerably across the country.  According to the HSE the waiting time for assessments varies around the country and, in general, the maximum waiting time is 12 months.  The Adoption Authority informs me that waiting times between the sending of an adoption application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries may vary greatly and may extend to as much as 3 years or more in some cases.  The Adoption Authority has no influence with regard to the waiting times involved in these sending countries.  Furthermore, some jurisdictions require a two stage adoption process which entails post-placement reports being submitted during an initial period of guardianship before an adoption is approved and finalised by the AAI.</p></reply>

These programmes are administered by my Department.</p><p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  About 67,000 children are expected to avail of the free pre-school provision in the school year 2012-2013 and funding of approximately &euro;176 million is being provided to support the programme.  It is my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit.  A key element of this is the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located in my Department.  </p><p>  Officials from my Department worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, which was launched last year.  My Department is committed to incentivising the early years sector to acquire additional skills in oral language competency development for young children once this minimum qualification requirements of the ECCE programme have been met. </p><p>  Annual funding is also provided to support the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which supports community-based childcare services by enabling them to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families, and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides  &euro;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC students for the duration of their course.  These programmes represent an annual investment in the region of &euro;64 million.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered as part of the preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.  This new Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life.</p></reply>

The majority of children in care are in foster care, one third of whom are placed with relatives.  Foster care applicants undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence.  This process has six stages Application, Assessment by a social worker, Garda vetting, medical and  referenced checks, including garda checks of adult children of the foster carers living at home, Approval by the Fostering Committee, Approval of the &lsquo;match&rsquo; between the foster carers with the Care Plan of the prospective child. Placement of a child with the foster carers. </p><p>  When a child is being placed in foster care, the suitability of a placement with relatives is explored in the first instance. Where the HSE is satisfied that an immediate placement with relatives is in the interests of the child, such placement frequently occurs before full approval of the committee is in place.  Such emergency placements are provided for in regulation.  Prior to and during the early stages of a placement, the relative is assessed by a principal social worker, including early Garda vetting.  This is followed by a full assessment and approval by the foster care committee as outlined above.</p></reply>

From 2008 to 2011 the budget allocation provided was to cover the cost of a full time Co-ordinator, a part-time Development Worker and a part-time Administrator.  The Family Support Agency, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers.  Expected savings over the period 2012 &ndash; 2014 are set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Effective from April 2012 the budget allocation for this particular Family Resource Centre is estimated at &euro;105,000 to include recent adjustments relating to the appropriate salary payable to two recent appointees. </p><p>  The Family Support Agency has written to all Family Resources Centres, advising them of the reduction in funding and the need to plan for change.  The Agency is acutely aware of the challenges that the reduction in funding presents.  It did not stipulate how centres should apply the reduction in funding, but asked the centres to focus in particular on addressing the scope for greater efficiencies to include reducing the day-to-day administration and overhead costs associated with the running of the centres.  The objective of this is to continue to support, as far as possible, the services that the centres provide to local families and groups.  The Agency advised the centres to engage with, and seek every assistance from, the two regional support agencies that provide support and training to them</p><p>  It should be noted that the Family Support Agency is also currently out a review of core funding expenditure within the Family Resource Centre Programme which will inform the future operation of the Family Resource Centre Programme funding.</p></reply>

In 2000, the organisation received &euro;10,160, and this figure increased each year up until 2009.  In 2009, it was one of 29 organisations selected for three year multi-annual funding.</p><p>  The Family Support Agency, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers.  Expected savings over the period 2012 &ndash; 2014 are set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  In 2012, the organisation in question received &euro;77,000.  The Family Support Agency is acutely aware of the challenges that any reduction in funding presents to organisations, and has asked the organisations it funds to focus in particular on addressing the scope for greater efficiencies.  The objective of this is to continue to support, as far as possible, the services that are provided to local families and groups.</p></reply>

An education and training strategy is currently under development in my Department and we intend becoming an organisation that values and encourages life-long learning.</p><p>  While the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested, I can confirm that approximately &euro;56,000 has been spent on education and training since the Department was established in June 2011. This takes account of expenditure on refund of fees for officials undertaking 3rd level qualifications in their own time, attendance at training programmes, seminars and conferences aimed at skills development and corporate memberships which are accounted for under the training budget. In addition, informal or on-the-job training is an important source of training and development and is used widely but as it is considered as part of normal working it is not accounted for in the above figures.</p><p>  Expenditure to-date is relatively small at this stage but I expect this level of investment to grow as the education and training strategy is finalised and more training is introduced.</p></reply>

The SCP aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the quality of attendance, participation and retention in school of its target cohort. The SCP is a key programme under the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  The SCP supports 124 projects and related initiatives operating in 472 primary and 225 post-primary schools. Each local project operates under the direction of a Local Management Committee which assess local needs to devise a costed proposal of interventions (known as the Retention Plan) to support young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage in their school, home and community life. The retention plan is submitted annually to the National Educational Welfare Board for consideration and approval. </p><p>  With regard to this year&rsquo;s funding arrangements for projects I am pleased to confirm that my Department has allocated the first tranche of funding for the 2012/2013 academic year to school based projects and related initiatives.  Budgets and administrative arrangements for the coming year are being finalised and will be confirmed to individual projects by the end of the September.</p><p>  The NEWB is responsible for the operational management, development and direction of the School Completion programme within its remit to deliver an integrated school support service. As part of this work the Board works closely with management committees, schools and local SCP co-ordinators to ensure student supports and interventions are tailored to meet local needs. The NEWB will assist each local project to review its planned programme of interventions to ensure projects are delivered within available resources in the coming academic year. </p><p>  In parallel with this ongoing process, my Department is also working to complete a comprehensive review of the School Completion Programme. It is anticipated that the review will identify operational efficiencies and other reforms which may assist to mitigate the impact of necessary savings and maintain the programme on a sustainable footing within available resources in the coming years. </p></reply>

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. </p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). </p><p>  The screening programme is the first call/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.</p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.  The focus is on improving quality and access at all publicly-funded screening colonoscopy units, not just for those referred for colonoscopy as part of the screening programme, but for all men and women who require a colonoscopy or any other diagnostic endoscopic procedure.  This will be achieved by building sufficient capacity in endoscopy services nationwide to sustain the implementation of the national screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the symptomatic service.</p><p>  Fifteen candidate colonoscopy units have been identified around the country to support the screening programme and these must achieve accreditation in order to provide colonoscopy services on behalf of the programme.</p><p>  An academic partner has been identified to provide an educational programme for clinical nurse specialists to train with the aim of becoming registered as Advanced Nurse Practitioners with An Bord Altranais.  Interviews have been completed and a panel has been established.  A Clinical Advisory Group has recently been established to support the ongoing development of the programme and to provide ongoing clinical advice to the HSE-NCSS.</p></reply>

On the basis of the pattern of expenditure to July 2012, it is not expected that this level of reduction will be achieved. In the light of the current serious budgetary situation in the HSE, senior management have issued strict instructions on the use of agency staffing.  Agency staff may be used only in the most exceptional of circumstances and when all alternative avenues have been exhausted.  Such staff may only be engaged when signed off by identified senior management.</p><p>  Following the enactment of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act this year, the HSE provided guidance to public service employers on the Act, including the fact that the equal pay provisions of the Act have retrospective effect to 5th December 2011. All agency staff employed through agencies contracted by the HSE have now had their basic pay adjusted in accordance with the Act.  The HSE and the contracted agencies are currently making arrangements for the calculation and payment of back money due to agency staff.</p></reply>

Accordingly, criteria have been restricted considerably in recent times and a uniform approach is being rolled out across the health regions.</p><p>  In general, patients are expected to make their own way to and from hospital and OPD appointments, using private or scheduled public transport.  The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients.  In these cases, the patient's appointment or treatment should be directly related to the condition.  Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  I am satisfied that significant savings will arise from the uniform national application of the criteria for non-emergency and non-stretcher based patient transport.</p></reply>

I am strongly committed to protecting the principle of Community Rating in the private health insurance market.  Community Rating means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher that their expected claims would require,  whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require.  It is also useful to note that older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have supported the older generation when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit in a similar way as they themselves now become older.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland and provides information to consumers regarding their rights and health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website is www.hia.ie and has a very useful plan comparison tool which may assist in finding the most suitable and competitive health insurance plan to meet one's needs.</p><p>  Community Rating needs a robust system of risk equalisation.  The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced in 2009 in order to provide direct support to community rating.  It achieves this by way of mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.</p><p>  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs+) receive an age-related tax credit equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product. The tax credit is provided as a tax relief at source, that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the age-related tax credit.  The Scheme is funded by an annual levy on health insurers based on the number of lives insured by them.  The Scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.  It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the levy on their clients.  </p><p>  In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I was pleased to increase significantly the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years and over from 1 January 2012.  Without this support health insurers would have had an even stronger financial incentive to 'segment' the market by offering policies targeted at young people to the disadvantage of older customers.</p><p>  It must be stressed that the measures taken are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, the old and the young.  The increased levy is balanced by a corresponding increase in tax credits for older people to that the system is Exchequer neutral.</p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place.  This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and also in the context of plans to introduce Universal Health Insurance from 2016.  In December 2011, the Government agreed to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013 which will replace the present Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy.  The new scheme will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status.  The legislation is currently being drafted and a Bill will be published in the next few weeks.</p><p>  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), with funds collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners.  In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners.  The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas.  </p></reply>

It should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of doctors with expertise in using the product and with a full understanding of the risks of therapy and the monitoring requirements. </p><p>  Under European and Irish legislation, all medicinal products must be authorised nationally or through common EU assessment procedures before being marketed.  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements.  Roaccutane has been closely monitored at national and EU level since it was first authorised.  It was most recently reviewed at EU level in April 2011 when further warnings regarding skin reactions were added to the product information for patients and their doctors.  The risk of depression associated with use of isotretinoin was also reviewed at that time.  However, the existing comprehensive information on the risk of depression associated with isotretinoin and the monitoring requirements provided on the product information were considered sufficient. </p><p>  The inclusion of new and updated warnings in the product information to support the safe and appropriate use of a medicine, is based on the evaluation of cumulative safety data and experience with use of the product, including reports of side effects occurring in patients.  The information for patients and for their doctors includes detailed advice on the risks associated with use of Roaccutane and recommendations to minimise their occurrence.  The package leaflet advises patients to tell their doctor if they have ever had any mental illness (including depression, suicidal behaviour or psychosis), or if they take medicines for any of these conditions.  It also advises them to contact their doctor straight away if they have signs of any of these problems. </p><p>  The information for doctors lists potential psychiatric disorders.  It emphasises that particular care needs to be taken in relation to patients with a history of depression and that all patients should be monitored for signs of depression during their treatment with the product and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary.  The benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks when the product is used in accordance with the product information.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to <blockquote>  (i) remove difficulties in relation to the effective operation of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, in particular to urgently provide for the Minister to continue to appoint professional representatives to the Council from the designated professions under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, whose term of office expired in March 2011, and<br /><br /><br />  (ii) implement Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications in respect of the professions designated under the 2005 Act and provide a legal base for the assessment of qualifications which are outside the scope of the Directive. </blockquote>  These amendments are technical in nature and simply facilitate the more effective operation of the Act.  It is hoped to have the Bill enacted during the current D&aacute;il session.</p></reply>

The Bill  provides for the abolition of the HSE Board and the establishment of a Directorate, headed by a Director General, to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the Board.  Under the Bill, the Directorate will be chaired by a Director General and will be made up of a minimum of three and a maximum of seven members.   Members will be appointed from National Director post holders.  </p><p>  In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE to reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services and greater transparency about funding,  service delivery and accountability.  Work is being undertaken at present to prepare the necessary detailed job specifications for the planned director posts.  It is envisaged that these posts will be filled on an accelerated basis in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The terms and conditions for these positions will be in accordance with Government policy and will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The<b></b>first contract covered a period of six months from 2 June 2011 to 3 November 2011 and was for a fixed price of &#8364;250,000.  On 29/11/2011 Value Based Solutions was engaged for a further three-year period, commencing in December 2011 and ending in December 2014.  The total value of this contract is &#8364;480,000 to be paid in 12 payments of &#8364;40,000.  To date, &#8364;120,000 has been paid under this contract.  Neither contract stipulates/stipulated a set weekly number of hours but rather set/s out the services that should be provided. </p><p><br />  Since the engagement of Value Based Solutions, significant progress has been made in relation to access and waiting times.  In relation to scheduled care, for example, in August 2012 as compared with May 2011 overall waiting list numbers have decreased from 56, 020 to 51, 955, a drop of 7%. There has been an 85% drop in the number of adults having to wait longer than 12 months and a 63% drop in those having to wait longer than nine months.  Equally, in relation to unscheduled care, the number of patients waiting on trolleys in EDs has reduced by 22% from January to September, compared to the same period last year (or 13,450 fewer patients).  The number of patients waiting on trolleys has fallen from a record of 569 on 5 January 2011 to 139 on 7 September 2012, while the 30 day moving average (average number of trolleys over 30 days) has fallen by 35% in 12 months, from 302 on 5 September 2011 to 197 on 7 September 2012.   </p></reply>

Arrangements were made to address these critical needs through, for example reassignment of staff, reorganisation of services and limited recruitment.  The Government is committed to reducing the size of the public service and the health service must contribute to the achievement of this objective.  Health numbers have already been reduced by over 9,000 wholetime equivalents, from a peak of 111,500 at the end of 2007.  The target for 2012 is to reduce numbers to approximately 102,000 and it is expected that this will be met.  But further reductions will be needed in the coming years to meet the target set by Government.  This requires further and substantial change in how services are organised and how people work.</p><p>  The Public Service Agreement is a key instrument in managing the reductions in resources in a structured way throughout the services.  The provisions of the Public Service Agreement continue to be used to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, and maximising redeployment to achieve more efficient delivery of services.  Staff resources will continue to be allocated to areas of greatest priority.  </p></reply>

Savings are being achieved through on-going off-patent price cuts; the pricing mechanism for new products has been changed; and we now have a review mechanism that takes account of price reductions in other countries.  Since 2010 these actions have achieved savings in the region of &euro;250 million. </p><p>  Furthermore, regulations made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 have reduced margins and mark-ups in the pharmaceutical supply chain.  The combined full-year savings from these measures are &euro;154 million. </p><p>  In addition, I announced on the 18th June 2012 that an interim agreement had been reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) to reduce the price of certain off patent medicines.  This is expected to deliver savings of &euro;10 million in 2012 (&euro;20 million in a full-year).  These price cuts were accepted in advance of further discussions which are expected to deliver more significant savings. Negotiations are ongoing between officials of the Department/HSE and the IPHA since the interim agreement was reached. These discussions are expected to reach a conclusion shortly.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 was published on the 13th of July 2012.  This legislation will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines.  These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.</p></reply>

Every individual will have a choice of health insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy.</p><p>  In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme. </p><p>  The Group will also assist my Department in preparing a White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance.  The White Paper will outline the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  Preparation of the White Paper is a complex process. It will involve significant financial modelling to support analysis of different design options and to estimate the cost of UHI. The White Paper will be published as early as possible within the Government&rsquo;s term of office. </p><p>  The  reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years.  The Implementation Group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and will oversee implementation of the reforms and consult widely.</p></reply>

Primary legislation is required to give effect to Government commitment to introduce a universal GP service without fees. </p><p>  Legislation to allow the Minister for Health to make regulations to extend access to GP services without fees to persons with prescribed illnesses is currently being drafted by this Department and the Office of the Attorney General and will be published shortly.

These dealt with a range of matters, including measures to ensure that the relevant parts of the Health Sectoral Agreement within the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 can be given effect.  These discussions concluded on  17 September.</p><p>  The outcome of this engagement is that the following proposals have been agreed between the parties: Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; There can be rostering of consultants where required on 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required (primarily Emergency Depts., obstetrics, anaesthetics); Clinical Directors will have strengthened management role and all consultants will be subject to Clinical Director&rsquo;s authority, e.g. re work schedules, performance, annual leave, cross-cover arrangements and compliance with rules on private practice; Consultants&rsquo; work location can to be changed to facilitate the most appropriate organisation of hospital services; There will be cooperation with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.</p><p>  Separately, Government will apply a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees and implement the Government &ldquo;pay cap&rdquo; so that salaries for future academic consultants will not exceed &euro;200,000 p.a.  Current consultants&rsquo; pay is protected under the Croke Park Agreement.</p><p>  Two matters, viz management proposals to reduce the &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; arrangements that currently apply and the elimination of the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &ldquo;historic rest days&rdquo; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-09-18a.4263.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012091800086#WRPPPP03000"><p>As I have previously advised the Deputy, my Department has no plans to carry out research into the impact of patients presenting in public hospitals who previously held private health insurance.  In respect of access to public hospitals, the work of the Special Delivery Unit is focussed on improving waiting times for access to both scheduled and unscheduled treatments and to maximise the capacity of existing facilities to manage patient flow. </p><p>  While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 38,913 this year, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to date, at less than 1.8% of the overall market in 2012.  This leaves some 2.123 million, or 46.3% of the population, covered by private health insurance.  Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers with private health insurance are retaining some level of health insurance cover.  In this context, I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.

As previously outlined to the Deputy in June, the HIA does not compile figures by county on the number of customers who have left the private health insurance market.   In relation to the average change in premiums, the HIA has estimated that the average premium increase per customer is 10 per cent, when comparing the second quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2012.  The HIA points out that any figures calculated for time periods of less than one year (for example, since Budget 2012) would be distorted, as this is the time of the year that insurers normally apply price changes.</p><p>  While there has been a decrease in the numbers with private health insurance, by 38,913 persons this year, it is important to note that the decline in private health insurance coverage is modest to date, at less than 1.8% of the overall market in 2012.  is leaves some 2.123 million, or 46.3% of the population, covered by private health insurance.  Even in the current difficult financial climate, the vast majority of consumers with private health insurance are retaining some level of health insurance cover.</p><p>  I would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. All customers should carefully consider the full range of plans and levels of cover available within the market, so that their own needs are fully met. Where customers wish to switch products, the relevant health insurance legislation ensures that switching is as easy and seamless as possible for customers.

The Strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  It will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Government Departments which will clearly set out each Department&rsquo;s objectives relating to older people. Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the Strategy.  However, I do not envisage that the Strategy will propose new service developments. Rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.   A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been completed.

The Programme for Government states that primary care will be an immediate priority area.   The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary care and represents a tangible re-focussing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.</p><p>  Within the context of its commercial remit, NAMA advises that it is at all times open to proposals which can contribute to the achievement of broader social and economic objectives and has committed to giving first option to public bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes.  The development of the primary care centre network is currently under review. Its delivery must be informed by needs analysis, with priority given to areas of urban and rural deprivation.   Therefore it is important to recognise that not all NAMA controlled buildings and sites are appropriately located or suitable.    The outcome of this review requires my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  Both Minister Shortall and I have had meetings with NAMA with a view to building on potential synergies between NAMA controlled land and property and the requirements of the health sector, not just in the area of primary care, but in other areas also.  The Health Service Executive and NAMA also engage constructively in this regard.  Minister Shortall has had informal discussions with the OPW regarding unused Garda stations and other buildings.   The Health Service Executive has also explored the possibility of making use of vacated Garda stations as Primary Care Centres.  To date none have been deemed suitable by the Executive.</p></reply>

I am strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.</p><p><br />  Community Rating<b></b>means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. It is also useful to note that older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have supported the older generation when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit in a similar way as they themselves now become older.</p><p><br />  Community Rating needs a robust system of risk equalisation.  Otherwise, insurers will have a strong incentive to avoid older customers.  Without risk equalisation insurers would have a clear incentive to attract and retain only healthy customers who are less likely to make claims. The Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy was introduced in 2009 in order to provide direct support to community rating. It achieves this by way of a mechanism which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old. </p><p><br />  The Interim Scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people, but that older people (in six age bands ranging from 60-64 yrs to 85 yrs+) receive an age-related tax credit equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product. The tax credit is provided as a tax relief at source - that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the age-related tax credit.  The Scheme is funded by an annual levy on health insurers based on the number of lives insured by them. The Scheme is designed to be Exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State. It is a matter for the insurance companies as to the extent, if any, they pass the levy on their clients.  </p><p><br />  In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I was pleased to increase significantly the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years and over, from 1 January 2012.  Without this support, health insurers would have had an even stronger financial incentive to 'segment' the market by offering policies targeted at young people, to the disadvantage of older customers.  It must be stressed that the measures taken are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, the old and the young.  The increased levy is balanced by a corresponding increase in tax credits for older people to that the system is Exchequer neutral.</p><p><br />  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a permanent scheme of risk equalisation.  This is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and also in the context of plans to introduce Universal Health Insurance from 2016.  In December 2011, the Government agreed to introduce a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) with effect from 1 January 2013 which will replace the present Interim Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy.  The new scheme will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the Interim Scheme, including a measure of health status.  The legislation is currently being drafted and a Bill will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p><br />  The new RES will be operated prospectively by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA).  Funds will be collected via a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners.  In terms of financial arrangements, the main difference between this and the current Interim Scheme is that risk equalisation payments will be disbursed by the HIA rather than by the Revenue Commissioners.  The rates will be set each year by an Act of the Oireachtas.  </p><p><br />  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland.  It provides information to policy holders in relation to rights and health insurance plans and the benefits provided.  The HIA's website is www.hia.ie and has a very useful health insurance plans comparison tool which may assist the public in finding the most suitable and competitive health insurance plan to meet their individual needs.  The telephone number of the HIA is Lo-Call 1850 929 166 or +353(0)1 406 0080.</p></reply>

As you are aware a new target of 9 month maximum waiting time for daycase and inpatient surgery has been implemented.   The challenge for 2012 is firstly to maintain the 12 month maximum waiting time target for in patient and day case procedures and then to continually improve and move to a 9 month maximum waiting time target.  </p><p>  At present the categorisation of patients within the scheduled care system is neither defined with sufficient clarity nor enacted for each patient with sufficient consistency. The lack of clarity is contributed to by some ambiguity and vagueness within the existing definitions; and the lack of consistency by insufficiently rigorous attributions within hospital data sets, and inadequate audit and review processes. Unless we succeed in introducing much higher levels of clarity and consistency, effective systems management will be impossible.  In that context it is the intention later in 2012 to request clinicians to categorise their referrals as either 'urgent' or 'routine'.  It is important to emphasise that determining urgency will always rest with clinicians.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made and there are many excellent examples of collaborative working between providers, and between providers and the HSE, in responding innovatively to the needs of individuals.  The HSE has received requests for 695 places for school leavers and 392 places in respect of RT graduates in 2012. To date 641 school leavers (92%) and 377 RT graduates (96%) have been accommodated with an appropriate service.</p><p>The health service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it and given the current economic environment, this has become a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families. HSE Managers and disability agencies continue to work collaboratively in identifying solutions for the remaining 54 school leavers and the 15 individuals progressing from RT who still require a suitable service.</p></reply>

The total gross budget for this year is &euro;994.7m. This is effectively the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, however, pre-Nursing Homes Support Scheme arrangements must also be facilitated from within the subhead, i.e. people in contract beds, people who choose to remain on subvention and people who were in public nursing homes prior to the commencement of the Scheme. </p><p>  Additional funding of &euro;55 million was originally allocated to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme for 2012. However, the Minister subsequently decided to transfer &euro;13 million of the &euro;55 million for an initiative being developed by the Special Delivery Unit in 2012 to improve access to care and quality of care for the frail elderly, achieve better patient outcomes and experience as well as better value for money. </p><p>  A further &euro;5 million was transferred to Primary Care services to underpin overall government policy of shifting focus to primary and community services.  Returns against the Vote and from HSE indicate spending within budget.  On average, applications for the Scheme take between 4 to 6 weeks to process, from receipt of completed application to date of determination. Depending on the level of complexity of the individual case, processing of the application may take longer. For example, in cases where ancillary State support is sought, additional factors may impact on the timeframe, e.g. the HSE must establish title of a property before a decision can be made and establishing title can be a lengthy process in some cases.</p></reply>

In this context, I want to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely and appropriately in smaller, local hospitals.  The Small Hospitals Framework will demonstrate clearly that the future of smaller hospitals is secure. It will set out what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospitals in the interest of better outcomes for patients. </p><p>  As Minister for Health I am eager to initiate improvements to our hospital system.   I am currently examining the Framework in the context of the overall reorganisation of the health services.  Such consideration will ensure that when implemented, it will optimise the significant resources that smaller hospitals have to offer. It is my intention to publish the Framework when this process has been completed.  Consideration of the establishment of Hospital Groups is also progressing. The changes that will and must take place will have a considerable impact on how our hospital services are aligned, including greater opportunities for inter-site co-operation. </p></reply>

The Directive and related case law from the European Court of Justice define working time as time spent at a place determined by the employer while performing duties on behalf of the employer. This can be summarised as time spent working or on-call on-site. Time spent on-call off-site does not count as working time.</p><p>  Consultants working in the public health service are employed under a number of contracts.  Consultants employed under the 1991 and 1997 Consultant Contracts are contracted to work 33 hours a week, while those employed under the 2008 Consultant Contract are contracted to work 37 hours a week.  Irrespective of contract, many consultants are liable to provide on-call services and attend on-site outside of contracted hours. Consultants employed on the 2008 Contract may be required formally to provide up to 5 additional hours on Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays &ndash; albeit, to date, this provision has not been activated in other than exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  While consultants have work schedules documenting contracted hours, they do not formally &lsquo;clock-in&rsquo; or participate in other means of recording time spent on-call on-site.  The HSE does not therefore hold information regarding average working hours in excess of the 33 or 37 weekly contracted hours. Taking the above into account, the HSE does not have information indicating that any hospital consultant is working an average of more than 48 hours a week calculated over the 6-month reference period.</p></reply>

At this meeting we discussed a range of issues including addressing the issue of driving down costs related to health insurance.  The outcome of the meeting was the agreement to establish a Health Insurance Consultative Forum to engage on issues of mutual concern.  </p><p>  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The core focus of the Forum is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  These ideas are the subject of ongoing deliberation and policy analysis within the Department.</p><p>  The Forum also facilitates participating parties to consider certain issues related to the implementation of Universal Health Insurance (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.  </p></reply>

This figure was determined as part of the normal budgetary process and, therefore, was not subject to discussions with insurance companies.</p><p>  From 1 January 2012, the charges for patients who choose to be treated on a private basis in public hospitals increased by between 3% and 5% depending on the category of hospital.  The increase in charges is in keeping with the long-standing policy of moving towards recovering the full economic cost of providing treatment to private patients in public hospitals.  It is anticipated that the increased charges will yield additional revenue in the region of &euro;18 million in 2012.  With regard to the introduction of new legislation to allow charges to be raised in respect of all private patients in public hospitals, work on this matter is proceeding in preparation for 2013.  In the meantime,  in order to raise the resources required for 2012, the Department has agreed a system of improved cash-flow and accelerated payment in principle with private health insurance providers which will provide a once-off cash flow benefit in 2012.  The details of the accelerated payment system are being finalised with the health insurers at present.</p></reply>

In this regard the HSE's National Clinical Programme for Blood Transfusion has reviewed services nationally for haemochromatosis patients with a view to providing a service that reflects best international practice in terms of patient care and value for money. I understand that discussions are ongoing with all relevant parties to implement a solution for haemochromatosis services and I look forward to hearing the outcome.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p></reply>

The Expert Body confirms that, based on the review of all previous and current international and national scientific data, the balance of evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be effective for protecting the oral health of all age groups.</p><p>  The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its &lsquo;Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water&rsquo; in 2011.  The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. Studies in Ireland and worldwide have found that water fluoridation has a significant benefit for dental health amongst both children and adults. Persons residing in fluoridated areas have better teeth with less disease than those residing in non-fluoridated areas. For example in the last all- Ireland survey, there was in the order of 40% fewer cavities in children living in fluoridated areas.</p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid (HFSA) is the chemical used in the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland. It goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications. The spend for fluoridation nationally in 2011 was &euro;3,865,406, broken down as follows:</p><p>  Operational costs &euro;2,392,266, HSFA costs &euro;1,387,561, Capital costs &euro;85,579.</p></reply>

Such services greatly reduce the risk of the use of contaminated injecting equipment through providing sterilised needles, syringes and associated injecting paraphernalia.  They also reduce the dangers posed by discarded needles through the strong emphasis on the exchange of used supplies for new.  As well as the direct benefits of needle exchange services, they also bring people into contact with other services and increase the possibilities for further engagement aimed at reducing heroin use.</p><p><br />  Needle exchange services are broadly available in the Dublin area through the HSE and voluntary sector organisations.  There has been significant improvement in the availability of needle exchange services outside Dublin over the past year through community pharmacies, HSE clinics, and voluntary sector organisations.  Such services will be expanded to further locations over the coming period through the involvement of more  community pharmacies.</p><p>It is not my intention to introduce supervised injection sites for heroin users.  Rather my focus is on ensuring that there is an increased emphasis on providing the opportunities for people to move on from illicit drug use, through drug treatment and rehabilitation, to a drug-free life where that is achievable.  A 2012 report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) indicates that heroin-assisted treatment is made available only in a small number of European countries.  While the report found some evidence that this treatment can be effective for a small minority of entrenched opioid users, the EMCDDA made clear that it was reporting only, rather than  advocating the provision of such services.</p><p><br />  The Ana Liffey Drugs Project has received considerable support, totalling over &#8364;2.26m, from my Department since 2009 as follows:</p><p><b>2009</b>  : &#8364;0.567m</p><p><b>2010</b>  : &#8364;0.542m</p><p><b>2011</b>  : &#8364;0.448m</p><p><b>2012</b>  : &#8364;0.704m</p></reply>

Following a review of this and other data,the European Medicines Agency recommended that the use of aliskiren with these medicines be contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or with moderate to severe kidney failure and that warnings should also be included recommending against the use of aliskiren with these medicines in general.The licence for aliskiren (Rasilez) has not been revoked and it continues to be available in all EU Member States subject to the updating of the prescribing information.

The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the  registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles.</p><p>  The regulation of the 12 professions designated under the Act is being implemented on a phased basis and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is intended that the remaining 10 registration boards and their registers will be established by end 2014.</p><p>  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate. Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:</p><p>(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;</p><p>(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners;</p><p>(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;</p><p>(d) The profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development;</p><p>(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;</p><p>(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant</p><p>   My Department's priority is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions designated under the Act. The extension of statutory registration arrangements under the Act for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated  professions are fully in place.</p><p>  Questions relating to the recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.  Any proposals relating to grade and pay levels would, of course, require the approval of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The June Performance Reports were considered by the Board and showed a net deficit of &euro;295m.  This report is published on the website of the Health Service Executive - www.hse.ie.  Based on the rate of drawdown of its Vote, the HSE was forecasting a shortfall in Vote terms of  approximately &euro;500m by the end of the year if no action is taken.  The Executive indicated that hospital activity, PCRS and retirements were significant factors contributing to the overrun. </p><p>  Since then, there has been intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure. In the short term to address the 2012 position it has been agreed that cash limits will be imposed on agency and overtime and there will be more intensive management of absenteeism. In addition, travel and subsistence will be limited, and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash. Other measures are also being undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget. These include reductions on services, the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. I have instructed the Executive to provide fortnightly reports on the cash situation, and the Regional Directors are being required to more intensively manage the cash so as to achieve a balanced vote. </p><p>  On a strategic level my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to address concerns around financial control in the HSE. These included engaging an expert from the UK NHS to examine the financial management of the HSE and make recommendations regarding strengthening and improving the management of its finances. PA Consultancy has been engaged to prepare an Action Plan for implementation of these recommendations.  In addition, a new Director General Designate has taken up position in the HSE and has been given a clear mandate in respect of controlling expenditure this year and putting forward proposals that deal with the challenge in 2013 and beyond.  </p></reply>

The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the  registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles.</p><p>  The regulation of the 12 professions designated under the Act is being implemented on a phased basis and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is intended that the remaining 10 registration boards and their registers will be established by end 2014.  </p><p>  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include,  if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate. Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:</p><p>(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;</p><p>(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners;</p><p>(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;</p><p>(d) The profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development;</p><p>(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;</p><p>(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant</p><p>   My Department's priority is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions designated under the Act. The extension of statutory registration arrangements under the Act for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated  professions are fully in place.</p><p>  Questions relating to the recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.  Any proposals relating to grade and pay levels would, of course, require the approval of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

I subsequently requested the Executive not to proceed with this reduction pending a fuller consideration of the effects and consequences of this measure.</p><p>  This measure was proposed in order to restore equity between the top-up bonus paid to people attending the HSE-funded rehabilitative training schemes following a reduction in a similar payment to students, including those with disabilities, attending F&Aacute;S/SOLAS training schemes. e proposed reduction remains under consideration in the context of the 2013 estimates.  Any reduction in payments to individuals requires adequate advance notice to enable the recipients and indeed, service providers, to take the reduction into account in planning their support needs and other arrangements.   It should also be noted that people with a disability attending Rehabilitative Training are usually in receipt of a State payment such as the Disability Allowance.</p></reply>

Further reductions to a range of fees and allowances were introduced in 2010, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;44 million.</p><p>  In relation to the specific comment re fees in respect of patients aged 70 or over, I wish to point out that the annual capitation fees in respect of such patients were reduced in 2009 as follows: From &euro;304.68 to &euro;280.31, where the patient is residing in the community; From &euro;973.99 to &euro;896.07, where the patient is residing in a private nursing home (approved by the HSE) for continuous periods in excess of five weeks.</p><p>  In 2010, the latter fee was further reduced from &euro;896.07 to &euro;448.04.  Under FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under regulations each year.  A review was carried out in 2012, at which time it was decided that the rates set in the regulations be left unchanged at present.</p></reply>

I understand that for various reasons the group met intermittently and has not now met for a number of years.</p><p><br />  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce legislation to facilitate courts making provision for structured settlements (Periodic Payment Orders) in circumstances where lump sums are currently awarded as a consequence of individuals suffering catastrophic injury because of the negligence of another.  I am aware that the High Court Working Group on Medical Negligence has made a number of recommendations on periodic payments and pre-action protocols.  I understand that <font color="#1F497D"> </font>these recommendations propose that infants, who have suffered catastrophic injuries at birth, will have their cases dealt with in a lesser time frame than pertains at present and also their care costs dealt with on an annual payment basis rather than by way of inclusion in a lump sum compensation package.  Consideration of the recommendations of the Group and any subsequent legislative changes will be a matter for the Minister for Justice Equality and Defence.  My Department will be liaising with the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.</p></reply>

Individuals with eating disorders frequently present to their general practitioner as a first resort and early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.  Community based Adult and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams receive referrals from general practitioners and provide assessment and treatment to their particular cohort.</p><p>  A special allocation of &euro;35m for mental health was provided in Budget 2012 in line with the Programme for Government commitments, part of which will support the treatment of eating disorders.  The &euro;35m funding will primarily be used to strengthen community mental health teams by ensuring, at a minimum that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on each team.  Over 400 additional staff will be recruited to support initiatives under the &euro;35m package.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes which are currently being developed.  Three areas in particular are being prioritised, one of which will be around the treatment and care of patients with eating disorders.</p><p>  The HSE has also developed a Mental Health in Primary Care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners with Dublin City University with a view to enhancing the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses, including eating disorders, within the primary care setting.  The HSE can and has worked with service providers in the independent sector to provide specialised care, on an in-patient and/or an out-patient basis.  In a limited number of cases, referrals to specialised eating disorder services in Dublin or the UK can be clinically recommended and supported in appropriate circumstances, subject to the necessary resources being available.</p><p>  The HSE has advised that, as there is no national information system in place for the mental health services, it is not in a position to provide information on the number of persons suffering from or admitted to the mental health services with an eating disorder.</p></reply>

The Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, which is mandatory in all primary schools and at Junior Cycle in post primary schools, provides a consistent and comprehensive whole-school approach to promoting the  health and well-being of children.  SPHE aims to foster self-worth and  self-confidence and places a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour and actions.</p><p>  The SPHE programme is implemented in collaboration with the Health Service  Executive (HSE).  There are also linkages with the Department's of Health and Children and HSE in relation to the development of child and adolescent mental  health guidelines and child welfare and protection services.  Guidelines addressing the issues of mental health and suicide prevention are  currently being finalised for post primary schools.  These have been informed by  feedback received from key stakeholders.  It is hoped that the finalised  guidelines will be circulated to post primary schools in the near future.</p></reply>

In addition, new entrant interns are subject to the new entrant salary scale which has been reduced by 10%.  The GP Trainee Allowance continues to be paid for existing GP trainees, but is not being paid to any new beneficiary with effect from 1st February 2012, pending the outcome of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Review of Allowances.</p><p>  In relation to the out-of-hours payment to GP trainees, this payment has not been abolished.  However, out-of-hours payments have been suspended for this year's trainees who are moving from a hospital placement to a General Practice placement, i.e. 3rd year trainees (not having been in receipt of this allowance previously).  GP trainees in their 4th year of training will continue to get the out-of-hours payment this year.

The purpose of the process was to generate sufficient numbers of qualified applicants for the July 2012 intake and for future intakes of NCHDs.  This process is intended to provide a continual stream of suitable candidates to meet the demand in particularly challenging specialties such as Emergency Medicine and Psychiatry.  </p><p>  The HSE recruits approximately 15% of NCHDs &ndash; all of whom are recruited to non-training posts. 81% of NCHDs are recruited by postgraduate training bodies for placement in hospitals/agencies. While deficits in the NCHD workforce have been a priority issue for the past three years, the HSE response has ensured that there has been little, if any, service reduction or change arising from problems filling posts. The key issue is the quality of applicants rather than whether the post can be filled. </p><p>  Three separate recruitment processes have been undertaken in preparation for the January and July 2013 rotations:</p><p>- Postgraduate training bodies are filling posts on training schemes</p><p>- the HSE Centralised Applications process &ndash; where NCHDs apply centrally but are recruited at hospital group level</p><p>- Other external HSE-funded initiatives (the most recent in South Africa) </p><p>As of 13 September 2012 there were 47 posts in HSE hospitals and agencies which were reported as vacant.  This 1% of all NCHD posts. </p><p>  The are no reported vacancies at Specialist Registrar level and it is also anticipated that there will be no vacancies at Intern level.  </p><p>  In 2006 the Government agreed a programme of reform of medical education and training which included a phased increase in EU medical places at undergraduate level. The reforms included an increase of 420 medical places for Irish and EU students on a phased basis over the period 2006 to 2011 with the objective of achieving self-sufficiency in terms of medical staffing and to reduce our reliance on the recruitment of overseas doctors. This increased intake will result in a greater availability of medical graduates to the Irish health service in the coming years.</p></reply>

There were no known safety issues with the vaccines received previously by the children identified. However, as the children did not receive the vaccines in accordance with the vaccine licence and may not have full immunity from preventable diseases. </p><p>  From HSE records available there were 290 children who may have been under-vaccinated.</p><p>  An Incident Management Team carried out an investigation regarding the GP's administration of Primary Childhood Immunisations. A report was prepared by the Incident Management Team leading to recommendations on three core issues: Immunisation practices of the GP concerned; Assessment of any risk to children immunised; Assurance on correct immunisation practices in General Practitioner settings nationwide.</p><p>  An implementation team was established to implement these recommendations, and have completed all actions with respect to these three issues.  On advice from the National Immunisation Office and the Department of Public Health, a re-vaccination exercise was offered.  The re-vaccination clinics took place on 30th August and 8th September 2012.</p><p>  An Implementation Report will issue on completion of the vaccination programme, and I look forward to receiving this report.</p></reply>

In 2012, 5.3% of the Health Service Executive Budget (&#8364;707 million) will be spent on specialist mental health services.  This is a lower percentage than in previous years as prior to 2012 the figures in the Revised Estimates for Public Services for Health Care Group Areas such as mental Health included an allocated share in relation to both pension and corporate costs, which are now shown separately.  About 1 in 4 people will experience some mental health problems in their lifetime, approximately 90% of mental health problems are dealt with in primary care and some 30% of people who attend primary care have a mental health problem and expenditure on these services is not captured in this percentage. </p><p><br />  A Report published in 2008  for the ntal Health Commission<i> - The Economics of Mental Healthcare in Ireland </i>(<i>O'Shea and Kennelly)</i>  estimated the overall economic cost of mental health problems in Ireland at just over &#8364;3 billion in 2006 largely in lost employment / productivity and the cost of healthcare provision.</p></reply>

The PSI does not regulate pharmacists in Northern Ireland and the relevant authority in that jurisdiction is the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (PSNI). It is possible to be registered as a pharmacist in Ireland with the PSI as well as with the PSNI or relevant authority in another country at the same time.</p><p>  A person&rsquo;s fitness to practise as a pharmacist may be determined under Part 6 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 which deals with the fitness to practise provisions of the Act. Under Part 6 of the Act, complaints may be made to the Council of the PSI in relation to the conduct of named Registered Pharmacists or Registered Retail Pharmacy Businesses. </p><p>  In order for a person to practise the profession of pharmacy in Ireland, the person must be registered on the register for pharmacists maintained by the PSI.  Pharmacists registered with the PSI are required to apply for continued registration annually. When a pharmacist applies for first registration or continued registration with the PSI, the Council is required by the Pharmacy Act 2007 to have regard to whether the pharmacist has been prohibited from practising as a pharmacist in another state.</p><p>  If it comes to the PSI Council&rsquo;s attention that a sanction is imposed in another jurisdiction on a pharmacist registered with the PSI, (e.g. cancellation, suspension of registration etc) the Council is required to notify the Minister and, where it is known, the employer of the pharmacist. Furthermore, the Council, if satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, may make public information regarding the sanction of a pharmacist in another jurisdiction.</p></reply>

Neither my colleague the Minister for Health, nor the HSE, have any remit in relation to employment rights in this case. Employees in Ireland are entitled to receive certain basic employment rights. These are governed by a range of detailed employment legislation which covers issues such as pay, health and safety, working time and other relevant employment criteria.   Accordingly, the Deputy&#8217;s question would appear to be more appropriate for consideration in the first instance by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation .   </p><p><br />  The Deputy will be aware that, under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, as part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent registration and inspection of designated centres providing residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities.  The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration, or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with relevant regulations or standards.   It should be noted, in particular, that Standard 26 of the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland provides that <i>&quot;the health and safety of the resident, staff and visitor to the residential care setting is promoted and protected&quot;.</i>   Should the employees in this particular case have concerns about compliance with this Standard, or indeed with the general governance and management arrangements at the home, they may wish to pursue the matter with HIQA.</p></reply>

The June Performance Reports were considered by the Board and showed a net deficit of &euro;295m.  This report is published on the website of the Health Service Executive - www.hse.ie.  Based on the rate of drawdown of its Vote, the HSE was forecasting a shortfall in Vote terms of  approximately &euro;500m by the end of the year if no action is taken.  The Executive indicated that hospital activity, PCRS and retirements were significant factors contributing to the overrun. </p><p>  Since then, there has been intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure. Following a number of meetings, additional cost containment measures were agreed and communicated to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 29th August.  It was outlined that in the short term, to address the 2012 position it had been agreed that cash limits will be imposed on agency and overtime and there would be more intensive management of absenteeism. In addition, travel and subsistence would be limited, and there would be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash. Other measures would also be undertaken in order to achieve a balanced budget, including reductions on services, the use of capital to fund revenue on a once-off basis and the transfer of Department funds to the HSE on a once-off basis. </p></reply>

Having taken legal advice, I am satisfied that the State does not have a legal liability for the injuries suffered by Irish survivors of thalidomide.  However, I have previously indicated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a financial gesture of goodwill towards Irish survivors of thalidomide, which will be constrained by virtue of the current economic circumstances of the country and the many demands made on limited resources.  The ITA has stated that it fundamentally disagrees with the State's position above and it is unwilling to engage with me on this basis.</p><p>  In July 2012, the ITA, through their solicitor, submitted 17 personal injury claims to me.  These claims have been delegated to the State Claims Agency.  I also informed both organisations that the Government's main concern is to address their health and social care needs.  The first step in this process is to identify the needs of each individual.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) and Dr Paul O'Connell, Consultant in Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Beaumont Hospital have developed a protocol for an appropriate assessment process. The ITA is also unwilling to engage in this process.</p><p>  However, the ITSS has written to the HSE regarding the extent and scope of the assessment process. Some major issues raised by the ITSS, including an independent agency, housing, heating and transport are unfortunately outside my Department's remit.  I have written to the ITSS requesting them, in good faith, to continue to engage with the HSE in developing and participating in a health care assessment process. The process and its outcome will provide information which will assist us in addressing the future health care needs of Irish survivors of thalidomide.</p></reply>

Under the existing system, a patient may elect to be treated privately by the hospital consultant, whereupon the patient is liable for all consultant fees and hospital charges, if any. The relationship between a consultant and his private patient is a matter of private contract between the doctor and the patient.  The Minister has no role in relation to this relationship.  The Government is committed to implementing a comprehensive programme of health reform, the ultimate objective of which is to ensure equal access to healthcare based on need, not income.

The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue issues concerning the move towards independent living in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Report.</p><p>  The VFM Review acknowledges that an individualised supports model has many aspects and may be implemented in a number of ways and recommends that further work should be undertaken by the HSE and the Department of Health to identify the precise features of the model proposed, taking into account that the model will be multi-form and multi-faceted, in order that it may be fully appraised and costed. The priority for the Department and the HSE is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from models which focus on independent living through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports and independent living once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.</p></reply>

The initial consultation on the efficiency and effectiveness of the disability services confirmed that people with disabilities and their families were looking for more choice in the services they receive and more control over how they access them. This consultation provided an input into the work of the Expert Reference Group on Disability Policy, which was established to advise the VFM Steering Group. The Report of the Expert Reference Group was released for public consultation: respondents strongly supported the proposed policy vision and goals, and were keen to see the service focus more directly on the individual needs of people with disabilities. </p><p>  Research was commissioned for the VFM Review from the National Disability Authority (NDA) on specialist disability services in six jurisdictions which are generally regarded as models of innovation and good practice &ndash; England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand and the State of Victoria (Australia). This research, which is available on the NDA website (www.nda.ie), informed the Advice Paper provided by the NDA to the Steering Group. The Expert Reference Group were also assisted in their deliberations by relevant international research findings.</p><p>  The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive will pursue the issue of individualised funding in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Report. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.</p></reply>

Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.  </p><p><br />  It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p><p><br />  The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.

This means that we must concentrate on maximising efficiency and getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. However, this on its own is not sufficient. Activity levels in our acute hospitals have been running ahead of the levels set in the approved HSE Service Plan and therefore it is inevitable that activity levels must also be reduced. This will be a significant challenge, and in meeting it we must be flexible and responsive to service needs, in order to ensure that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount.  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

It is an important stepping stone towards the introduction of universal health insurance which is the ultimate destination of the Government's reform programme.  As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. Each Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes, within a clearly defined budget and employment ceiling.</p><p>  In June 2012, the Minister announced the appointment of Professor John R Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups. As Chair, he will have a key role in progressing the creation of Hospital Groups initially and, ultimately, Independent Hospital Trusts.    The Project Group led by Professor John Higgins has carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other key advocacy groups which have requested an opportunity to be consulted. In addition, a significant number of submissions have been received by the Project Group. The consultation process has continued through the summer and will conclude later this month.</p><p>  Criteria for the formation of Hospital Groups and proposed groups arising from these criteria will be identified by the Project Group. A Strategic Board is being established to consider the findings and proposals of the Project Group prior to their submission to the Minister and, subsequently, to Government. The submission to Government is planned to take place before the end of the year.  The Board will also have an ongoing role in overseeing the implementation of proposals in relation to Hospital Groups approved by Government. It is scheduled to have its first meeting in early October.</p></reply>

The upper limit for consultants who held a contract prior to 2008 is 30%.  The HSE has put in place arrangements to measure consultants' private practice and to pursue issues of compliance where necessary.  The Contract provides for a series of steps to be taken where a consultant exceeds the level of private practice permitted in his or her contract.  As of April 2012, a total of 49 Consultants had been identified as being in breach of their permitted public/private practice ratio after the period for this to be addressed, as provided for in the Contract, had elapsed. </p><p>  In the light of the information emerging from the measurement of public/private practice activity, the HSE engaged with the medical representative bodies and individual consultants to pursue the issue of compliance, with a particular focus on consultants who are significantly in breach of their permitted ratio. There has been a significant improvement in the level of compliance with the private practice rules.  In addition, the proposals agreed between health service management and the consultant representative organisations on 17 September include provisions regarding compliance with the contractual requirements regarding private practice  These include commitment by consultants to measures that ensure that public patients waiting for elective care of any type are seen within clinically appropriate timeframes and that the entirety of the Consultant&rsquo;s clinical activity, including in-patient, day-patient and out-patient activity, is within contractual limits.</p></reply>

I decided to reappoint the outgoing Chairperson for a further year commencing on 15th May, 2012 to ensure the stability and continuity of the Board in light of the number of vacancies that were arising on the Board in 2012. The position of Chairperson of HIQA was not advertised via the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>  Six vacancies on the HIQA Board were advertised on the Department's website and on the Public Appointments Service website, publicjobs.ie, in March 2012. A further vacancy on the Board arose subsequently which means that there are now 7 vacant positions on the Board.  I am currently in the process of making appointments to the HIQA Board to fill these vacant positions. </p></reply>

The primary purpose of such records is the support of patient safety, improved quality of care, together with improved efficiency. They can also provide new and valuable opportunities for reform of the service delivery model.</p><p>  The development of EHRs on a national basis poses considerable challenges in terms of interoperability of systems, costs, privacy and security which are prerequisites in support of the development of such systems.</p><p>  As the Deputy will know, the health system is a complex environment with heterogenous information systems and multiple service providers which must be linked together to supply the relevant information to support the EHR concept. In some other jurisdictions the development of EHR's is aimed at producing summary care records containing key patient information.</p><p>  My Department is currently developing an eHealth strategy which will outline the core building blocks required to develop the optimum environment to support the development of information systems required to enhance patient care, connected health, efficiency and reform. It is working closely with the HSE and HIQA in developing the necessary supporting infrastructure and information standards. The legislative environment required to underpin the governance for health information systems including EHR's will be provided by the Health Information Bill to be published before the end of the year.</p><p>  A key component of this new infrastructure will be a system to support unique patient identification operating in tandem with the public service card infrastructure.</p></reply>

Evidence shows that pricing is a key tool in the efforts to control smoking and in particular preventing children and adolescents from taking up the habit.   Earlier this year an international group of health economists and tobacco control experts (PPACTE) called for an increase in the taxation of all tobacco products as the most effective way to make them inaccessible to consumers.  As you know this Government increased the excise duty on tobacco products in the last budget. The Tobacco Policy Review Group will be reporting to me in the near future and is considering the issue of  excise duties on tobacco products.  I am of the view that increasing tax on tobacco together with the strengthening of policy, services and programmes will be effective in reducing smoking prevalence in this country.</p></reply>

In particular, it has allowed health services to continue to be delivered, against a backdrop of ever-increasing budget and staffing reductions. Since its inception in 2010, the Public Service Agreement has helped the health sector to manage the reduction of staff numbers by over 7,000.  In particular, it showed its value in enabling the health service to cope with the <b>&#8216;</b>  Grace Period&#8217; exits.  In the six months to the end of February 2012, almost 5,000 staff members retired from the health service and all key services including maternity, critical care, neonatal and essential social services were maintained without interruption.  This was facilitated to a large degree by the flexibility provisions in the Agreement.  During this time the response and co-operation of staff often went beyond the terms of the Agreement.  Approximately 3,500 staff have been redeployed within the health services.</p><p><br />  Local management across the health services have fundamentally reviewed their rosters to ensure that they are optimised for efficient delivery of services.  An extended working day is now in place  in hospital laboratory and radiography services.  Staff are co-operating with clinical care changes in hospitals resulting in initiatives such as the Acute Medicine Programme saving 70,000 bed days and the Productive Theatre system, improving theatre utilisation by  90%.  In recent days, significant reforms have been negotiated with hospital consultants' representatives also.  </p><p><br />  With regard to my Department, since the commencement of the Agreement in  2010, the focus has been, and continues to be, on improving our efficiency and re-aligning structures to make it possible to best deliver a significantly increased work programme with progressively reducing staff resources.  The Special Delivery Unit has been established.   Cross-stream reporting has been introduced into the Department.   A number of agencies have been subsumed into the Department under the rationalisation of agencies programme.  In addition, my Department provides an interim service to the Adoption Authority in respect of financial services pending the establishment of their own finance function. ICT services are also being provided to the Adoption Authority by my Department on a shared service basis. A shared service is also being provided to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for their financial and ICT services.   Clear guidelines and procedures in respect of the management of absenteeism have issued to all staff.   </p><p><br />  Full details in respect of the reforms and savings delivered within my Department and the wider health sector can be found on both my Department's website (www.doh.ie) and that of the national level implementation body (www.implementationbody.gov.ie) </p></reply>

I have also made it clear that I do not propose to accept or reject any of the recommendations of Fishers Associates at this stage.

No new Public Bodies have been established. </p><p><br />  The merger of Dublin Tourism with its parent body  - F&aacute;ilte Ireland - is now complete, while Coaching Ireland is being subsumed into the Irish Sports Council.  The Government decided in May 2012 that Shannon Development&#8217;s tourism functions should transfer to F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Planning and preparations for this transfer are underway.</p><p><br />  Dundalk Port Company was merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, while Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1st January 2012. The  Board of Harbour Commissioners ceased to exist in each case.The current intention is that the last remaining harbour under the auspices of my Department, Bantry Bay, will be transferred to a more appropriate governance framework over the course of the next year. My Department is also currently engaged in a review of ports policy which will, inter alia, consider the issue of port company restructuring.</p><p><br />  The Public Service Reform Plan () sets out full details of all agencies, including those under the aegis of my Department, which are to be rationalised in 2012 and 2013 and also those which were subject to critical review.  It is not possible to quantify the potential savings from rationalisation until the detailed arrangements in respect of each implementation have been worked through with the agencies in question.</p><p><br />  The funding provided to agencies under the aegis of my Department is set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Expenditure 2012 and can be found on the Department of Public Expenditure and reform website ()</p></reply>

The decision was only taken after detailed consideration of the consequences of a failure to do so, which involved an unacceptable risk to the provision of public transport services in the coming months. </p><p>  As regards specific queries raised by the Deputies, the issue was discussed by the Government at its meeting on 24 July and the decision was announced on the same day.  The provision of public service obligation (PSO) services by the CI&Eacute; companies is subject to contract between the companies and the National Transport Authority (NTA). The allocation of the additional PSO subvention is a matter therefore for the NTA in conjunction with the companies.</p><p>  The additional subvention relates to compensation for PSO contracted services and is required in order that the CI&Eacute; companies could fulfil their existing PSO contracts in 2012.  There will be absolutely no subvention of any commercial services operated by the CI&Eacute; companies.  Funding of PSO contracts is done in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, as amended by the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, and EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 of 23 October 2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road.</p><p>  The reallocation involved includes savings on the public transport programme, Smarter Travel/carbon reduction measures and sports and deferral of expenditure in the maritime sector and on tourism product development.</p></reply>

Moreover the ability to operate profitably and without the need of any subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new rail projects or extensions.    </p><p><br />  Phase 2 of the Western Rail  Corridor, Athenry to Tuam, is being deferred for consideration in 2015, in advance of the next Public Capital Programme. The extension of the Western Rail Corridor from Tuam to Claremorris, ie Phase 3,  for either passenger of freight services can only be considered after Phase 2 is completed.   </p><p><br />  In relation to the railway line from Limerick to Shannon Foynes Port any proposal regarding re-opening  is dependent on proposals from the  private sector to fund the necessary investment. It is not proposed to fund any such re-opening from public funds, as no such funds are available.

It is proposed that operators with higher ratings will be checked more closely and more often than those with lower ratings.  Priorities for my Department and the Road Safety Authority in relation to the Act in question are to finalise the necessary secondary legislation to give effect to the various provisions contained in the Act and to implement the various components of a commercial vehicle reform programme as quickly as possible so as to improve the roadworthiness condition of commercial vehicles on our roads and road safety.</p></reply>

The Review Group was mindful, in making its recommendations, of the impact of the proposals on the taxi sector.

The timetable for implementation of the remaining actions is set out in the Review Report with short-term actions to be implemented this year and medium-term actions to be implemented after 2012. The NTA is required to report progress on implementation of the Review Recommendations quarterly to the Taxi Advisory Committee which includes representation from the taxi sector. </p><p>  This Autumn I will bring forward a Taxi Regulation Bill for publication which will give effect to the Review proposals aimed at strengthening enforcement of the taxi regulations. </p></reply>
