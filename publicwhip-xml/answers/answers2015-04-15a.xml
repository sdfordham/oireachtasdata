This funding is directed towards three programmes, which aim to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of early years and school-age care and education. These programmes &ndash; the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes &ndash; support the provision of early years and school-age care and education for more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of this (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It is critically important that any investment is designed to achieve the best outcomes for children and their parents. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in early years and after-school care and education.</p>  <p>  This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children. The Group is still in the early stages of its deliberations but has begun to solicit the views of key stakeholders through a number of consultative processes including the Open Policy Debate on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education Services, which was hosted by my Department on 31 March 2015. This Debate, which was conducted in line with recommendations contained in the Civil Service Renewal Programme, was attended by some 40 invited representatives.  These included parents, providers, academics, City/County Childcare Committees, and non-governmental organisations. The Debate provided a forum for a range of options for future investment to be discussed and for views on the future policy direction for early years and school-age care and education to be articulated. </p>  <p>  The views presented at this Debate will inform the on-going work of the Inter-Departmental Group.  A report of the Debate is currently being compiled and will be published in due course.  Further engagement with stakeholders is planned before the Inter-Departmental Group's final report is prepared and submitted to Government.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has indicated  a similar allocation for the programme in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first two instalments of 2014/15 funding have issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for May 2015.  </p>  <p>  The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion Programme, which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operation. Its final report is expected very shortly. The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the DEIS programme which was also prepared by the ESRI , and which refers to the School Completion Programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education. </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services. The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.</p></reply>

A number of actions arising from the summit were formalised into an action plan to address homelessness, and substantial progress has been made in implementing that plan.  Overall progress is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plan and progress reports are available on the website of Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p><p>The December, 2014 <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>includes a commitment for Tusla and Dublin City Council to coordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular protection and welfare needs that might arise for families in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Tusla has had meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council in relation to vulnerable families and issues facing care leavers.  Tusla intends to create a multi-agency protocol to be clear about individual agency and multi-agency responsibilities with regard to homelessness, and work on this will commence shortly.</p><p>In cases where there are welfare or protection concerns in relation to children in families presenting as homeless, the reporting of such concerns to Tusla is governed by <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>(2011).</p><p>For clarity, policy responsibility for homelessness, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit, and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and local authorities.  Matters in relation to child poverty and educational attainment fall within the remit of the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills respectively.</p><p>With regard to correspondence with Minister Kelly on the issue of homelessness, there continues to be on-going, significant communication and cooperation between our Departments and related agencies as part of a wider Government approach to addressing this issue.</p></reply>

These provisions include the option to avail of the programme on a pro-rata basis over a two year time period, and also the option to avail of an exemption to the upper age limit for entry to the programme. </p>  <p>  The majority of children with special needs are in a position to access the free pre-school provision in mainstream childcare settings, but I want to ensure the consistency of support for those children who cannot avail of pre-school services without specialised support.  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills, is working to develop an agreed framework for the provision of resources to support children with special needs in mainstream childcare settings. </p>  <p>  The high level Inter-Departmental Group which I established to examine the issue of future investment in early years and school age care and education is considering all aspects of provision, including the issue of support for children with special needs who wish to access mainstream services.  The Group is still in the early stages of its deliberations.  I expect that a report will be provided to me in June this year.  The Government will then be in a position to consider the direction of future investment in the sector, including in the very important area of special needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-15a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041500050#WRA01400"><p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carried out an announced inspection of Child Protection and Welfare Services in Cork in October 2014. The investigation identified two areas of significant risk, which were immediately addressed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The remaining actions addressing the inspection findings were published in an Action Plan with specific time-lines for each point. </p>  <p>  Children known to social work departments are required to have an allocated social worker. However, resource constraints and staff on leave can affect the allocation status of cases. These cases are monitored regularly by the social work Team Leaders and Principal Social Workers and managed on a day-to-day basis by the duty social work team. The reviews of these cases take account of changes in the child's circumstances and the case can be re-prioritised, if appropriate. </p>  <p>  As the allocation of social workers is a priority with Tusla, a review is to take place of all cases awaiting allocation to determine the level of resources required and to overall improve the service being provided. It is important to note that the downward trend for children waiting to be allocated a social worker in 2014 has been achieved at the current level of resources and staffing.</p>  <p>  Tusla is making strong efforts to fill the social work posts as quickly as possible. It is one of my key priorities to ensure that Tusla's workforce development plan addresses both current and future service needs for our most vulnerable children.</p></reply>

It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy is being developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people. A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing its development. This Task Group comprises representatives of Government Departments, relevant agencies, business, academia and youth interests. A comprehensive consultation with youth stakeholders and young people on the priorities for the youth strategy has recently concluded. My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy by early Summer. </p></reply>

The accommodation needs of these young people will be identified as part of their aftercare plan. The accommodation needs of children who are in the care of their parents where the family is homeless are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.</p><p>The Child Care Act 1991 provides that children under 18 years of age, who present as out of home, can be received into care where this is in their best interests.  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has its own operational policy which states that accommodating a child under Section 5 of the 1991 Act will only apply to children aged 16 or 17 and only where their best interests would not be met by being received into care. Tusla is establishing local inter-agency committees to oversee implementation of aftercare plans to cater for young adults leaving care who are at risk of homelessness.  My Department, Tusla  and the County and City Management Association have agreed a protocol to reduce this risk.</p><p>It would not be appropriate for Tusla to intervene and take children into care when families become homeless.  These parents remain their children&rsquo;s primary carer - their financial situation is not grounds for removing children from their care.  Tusla&rsquo;s role is to support them in the same way that it supports any family where child welfare issues are identified, to provide family support and assess any child protection concern that arise.  Where Tusla identifies underlying problems such as parental mental heath, addiction or parenting problems, it can refer the family to the appropriate service or provide the support and oversight needed to ensure the welfare and protection of the children. </p><p>In February 2013, the Minister for Housing and Planning published the Government's Homelessness Policy Statement which aims to end long term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential for family life.  My officials and I are engaged with the Minister and the Homelessness Oversight Group to  progress this issue.</p><p>On the 4th of December, 2014, Minister Kelly hosted a special summit on homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness, including that of families with children, by the end of 2016.  A number of actions arising from the summit were formalised into an action plan to address homelessness, and substantial progress has been made in implementing that plan.  Overall progress is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plan and progress reports are available on the website of Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p><p>The December, 2014 <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>includes a commitment for Tusla and Dublin City Council to coordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the particular protection and welfare needs that might arise for families in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Tusla has had meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council in relation to vulnerable families and issues facing care leavers.  Tusla intends to create a multi-agency protocol to be clear about individual agency and multi-agency responsibilities with regard to homelessness, and work on this will commence shortly.</p></reply>

This programme represents an annual investment of more than &euro;170 million in pre-school services. </p><p>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current provision. This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in childcare-related programmes.  This will take time, as the benefits of growth generate the required resources.  However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence and be strategically co-ordinated, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children and parents.</p><p>As you are aware, the Inter-Departmental Group which I recently established will look at early years provision right across the 0 to 6 age group, as well as consider the after-school needs of school-going children.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services and the Group has been asked to report to me by the Summer.</p><p>All the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.

The Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, and in response developed a detailed Implementation Plan, which set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations to improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk. The Fourth and Final Monitoring Report of the Ryan Implementation Group, which was recently approved by Government and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas notes that the vast majority of the recommendations (i.e. 94 out of a total of 99), have been implemented or are being implemented on an ongoing basis. It should also be noted that the Monitoring Group, which authored the Report, welcomed the significant positive developments that have taken place over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan.</p><p>Should an allegation arise regarding historical child abuse by a State institution, or indeed any organisation or person, there are a number of issues which would be taken into consideration.</p><p>In general, each Government Department is responsible for implementing child protection measures, which include preventative and protective strategies, within its own sector. So, for example, in relation to schools, the Department of Education has a suite of child protection guidelines and protocols in place. My Department chairs the Children First Implementation Group which supports consistency in the implementation of the <i>Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>(2011), across all relevant Departments and sectors.</p><p>At present, in the event that a reasonable concern arises that abuse has occurred, <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</i>outlines the steps which should be taken to report concerns. The Children First Bill, 2014, which will shortly be progressing into Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, proposes to place elements of the National Guidance on a statutory basis. In effect this means that certain categories of person will now acquire a statutory responsibility to report concerns of harm which meet or exceed a defined threshold to the Child and Family Agency. In addition, organisations which provide relevant services to children will, once the Bill is commenced, be required to undertake an assessment of risk in relation to the harm which may come to a child while availing of its services and to prepare a Child Safeguarding Statement which outlines the procedures which are in place to mitigate the identified risks. </p><p>The Government has no plans currently to carry out any further systemic historical reviews at this time.</p><p>If an allegation of historical abuse is made, the Child and Family Agency, under its statutory responsibility under section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, is required to investigate such allegations. This would include establishing whether the alleged perpetrator presents a current risk to children. If the allegation is made by a child, the Agency would also be required to take the steps it considers necessary to protect the child in question. Finally, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na also has a role in relation to historical abuse in the context of investigating any criminal aspects thereof. It is of course always open to any individual to have recourse to the courts in relation to any allegation of a crime, including historical abuse.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year. These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the universal free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 67,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.  In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children. The Group, which is still in the early stages of its deliberations, will submit its final report to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

If a child is taken into care as a result of sexual abuse, the allocated social worker in Tusla will provide counselling and support.</p>  <p>  Where children have suffered sexual abuse, therapy services are available in a variety of settings. There are specialist sexual abuse centres at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital. Therapy services are also provided by HSE community based psychologists and the HSE Child And Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) for children who have moderate to severe mental health problems.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Assessment, Consultation &amp;amp; Therapy Service (ACTS) is a national specialised clinical service which has been developed in order to provide multi-disciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs. ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes:-</p>  <p>  - on-site therapeutic services to young people in secure settings in Ireland (Special Care and the Children Detention Schools)</p>  <p>  - support when young people return to community settings to help them to re-engage with mainstream services as appropriate</p>  <p>  - assessment, consultation and/or intervention services in the community for children at significant risk of placement in secure settings.</p>  <p>  Tusla is currently leading a multi-agency process to implement a national service model for sexual abuse services for children and their families.  This process aims to incorporate all resources currently applied to sexual abuse services into a co-ordinated service providing standardised models of best practice with national and multi-agency oversight.  It integrates and co-ordinates the six separate sexual abuse services which children may need to access. These services include medical/forensic examination; child protection; Garda investigation; assessment; therapy and court process.</p>  <p>  The agencies involved in this process are Tusla, the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, the Probation Service and CARI. The model is informed by the recommendations of the Ferns Report 2005 and the National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People, June 2011 (HSE / Mott McDonald).</p>  <p>  All agencies are committed to the implementation of the model with a number of initiatives currently under way.  For example, the HSE is establishing a new medical/forensic examination facility for the greater Dublin area; specialist sexual abuse services are being developed within the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and Tusla is employing four additional staff at Principal Social Worker grade to support the implementation process.</p></reply>

A jobseeker who is available for and genuinely seeking work can apply for the contribution-based jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, depending on their previous employment history.  While the Department does not provide any specific supports for those wishing to join or return to work in the hackney industry, a jobseeker may avail of any of the following supports to aid their return to employment/self-employment:</p><p>- A person who is self-employed can apply for jobseeker's allowance if their income falls below a certain level. The applicant can continue in self-employment with their earnings from the business assessed to determine the level of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that can be paid.</p><p>- The short-term enterprise allowance (STEA) gives support to a person who has lost their job and is in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment from the Department and wants to start their own business.  The STEA payment will cease when the entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit expires.</p><p>- The back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) is available to support long-term jobseekers that undertake to develop or take up self-employment opportunities.  BTWEA provides for the retention of the value of the prior social protection payment on a reducing scale over two years, plus continued access to secondary benefits where the conditions for those are met.  In determining if a business proposal will be supported, issues of displacement of existing operators are considered.  Given the nature of the taxi and hackney services, the likelihood of such a proposal being approved for BTWEA is considered to be relatively low.</p><p>- Employers may also access the subsidies available under JobsPlus where they recruit jobseekers who are longer-term unemployed.</p><p>Jobseekers considering pursuing self-employment options may also access training and business planning supports offered by the Department, local development companies and local enterprise offices.</p><p>Information on accessing schemes and supports for jobseekers is available from DSP Intreo centres with further information available on the Department&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, for which Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  The Department recently published a review of the maximum rent limits, &ldquo;Maximum Rent Limit Analysis and Findings&rdquo; and it is available on www.welfare.ie. The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market. The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation. The review finds that increasing the rent limits would have several potentially negative effects, including providing an impetus for current rent supplement landlords to renegotiate their lease agreements to the new limits impacting on all existing recipients at significant cost to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In light of the review&rsquo;s findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances throughout the county, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits if deemed appropriate. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,000 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.</p>  <p>  The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation. The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy. Policy in relation to rent controls is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that I am keeping this matter under close review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.</p></reply>

The trustees of such pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under Trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  In addition, the Pensions Act, 1990 provides for the regulation of occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.  The Pensions Authority supervises and monitors the operation of the Pensions Act.</p>  <p>  The trustees of pension schemes are required under the Pensions Act to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme in the event of the wind-up of a pension scheme.  This is often referred to as the Funding Standard which is a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health &ldquo;of a scheme can be tested.  The trustees are required to report to the Pensions Authority on their funding position on a regular basis. A scheme failing to meet the funding requirement means that the scheme will not be able to pay all the benefits promised unless some action is taken.  In such an event, the trustees are required to submit proposals to the Pensions Authority setting out what measures will be put in place to restore scheme funding and ensure that the scheme is sustainable and in a position to secure the promised level of benefit for all members into the future.  The responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that the scheme is properly funded and managed.</p></reply>

The average FIS payment per family is &euro;114 per week.</p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight (or 19 hours per week). The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  Reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) which were implemented in a phased basis in July 2013 and July 2014, have resulted in an increase in lone parents applying for FIS. This is evidence that lone parents whose entitlement to OFP ceased on foot of the age reforms have over the previous two years increased their working hours in order to claim FIS. Where lone parents are working less than 38 hours per fortnight they may qualify for a jobseeker's payment including the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement if their youngest child is under 14 years of age.</p>  <p>  The Labour Market Council is in the process of establishing a sub-group that will specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist transitioning OFP customers with increasing their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for FIS and, subsequently, the BWFD. This sub-group will also look at ways in which employers can assist with the promotion of the BWFD.</p>  <p>  The previous experience of the OFP reform, together with the introduction of the BWFD and the initiative of the Labour Market Council, would indicate that lone parents will have both the incentive and the opportunity to increase their hours of work, and thus to become eligible for FIS, thereby greatly enhancing their income and living conditions.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years.</p><p>The <i>Pathways to Work </i>Strategy provides for enhanced engagement services and additional activation measures to jobseekers while the recovery takes hold. In addition to ongoing reforms, the 2015 iteration of the strategy prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed. This includes a structured process of engagement with the existing long-term unemployed that will see at least 8,300 long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process each month in early 2015.</p><p>Second, a new employment services model for the long-term unemployed, JobPath, will be rolled out in 2015. It is a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services that will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers. Referrals to JobPath providers are expected to commence early in the second half of 2015.</p><p>In support of these enhanced engagement processes, 57,000 further education and training places will continue to be reserved for the long-term unemployed in 2015. A minimum of 16,000 places for the long-term unemployed will also be provided through key public employment programmes. This includes an expansion of the JobsPlus initiative, an employment subsidy that incentivises employers to recruit the long-term unemployed. </p><p>Information on numbers on the Live Register at the end of March 2015 is detailed in the below statement.</p><p><b>Live Register numbers by duration, end March 2015</b><table><tr><th>&amp;lt;1 Year</th><th>1-2yrs</th><th>2-3yrs</th><th>3-5yrs</th><th>5-10yrs</th><th>&amp;gt;10yrs</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>188,273</td><td>42,426</td><td>26,429</td><td>38,467</td><td>44,679</td><td>8,402</td><td>348,676</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Funding is determined by the level of outputs generated having regard to the nature of the services and to similar services funded by the programme.  The Deputy should note that the funds available under the CSP are a contribution to the cost of the delivery of a service only and are not intended to cover full costs of provision.  The contractor accepts the obligation to generate the balance of funds needed themselves to meet pay and operational costs.</p>  <p>  CSP contracts are monitored on an ongoing and regular basis to ensure that the requirements of the programme are met and that the services that are subject to contract are being delivered.  In the case of the company for which details were supplied, it was found that the level of activity in the company did not warrant the level of resources provided, that value for money was not being achieved and that the longer term financial viability of the company needed to be improved.  To this end, the value of the contract was reduced to reflect the activity levels of the company and additional cash grants were made available to the company to sustain its operations, while it improved its level of income generation, productivity and overall service delivery and value for money.  The value of the contract for 2015 is considered realistic given the outputs being generated and amount to some &euro;123,000.</p>  <p>  This operation is not due to be reviewed again until 2016.  A review enables the progress achieved to be verified and for further consideration to be made as to the level of resources to be offered which will be related to the level and quality of services delivered.</p></reply>

It provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed. The employment offered must be of a full-time nature of at least 30 hours per week over four days and must not displace existing employment.  Since July 2013, 18,940 jobseekers have confirmed their eligibility for JobsPlus, of which 4,424 are currently in employment.</p>  <p>  Employee pay rates are a matter for agreement between the employer and employee. Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, employees are entitled to a minimum wage, currently &euro;8.65 per hour.  Employers recruiting under the JobsPlus initiative are required to comply with the Act and other statutory provisions in respect of pay and conditions.</p>  <p>  The Department collects data from employers in respect of expected pay levels at registration and this indicates that over 80% of employers at the time of recruitment intended to pay above the minimum pay rate.  This is considered reasonable given that starting pay rates will inevitably be lower than standard pay rates within an employment.  The Department has commenced structured monitoring of employers and also consults separately with employees on the operation of JobsPlus.  The Department also reserves the right to withdraw the wage subsidy from any employer who acts in manner inconsistent with the terms of JobsPlus or fails to meet the statutory requirements with respect to pay.</p></reply>

In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

No. 142 of 2007), as amended.  Section 112(1) of the Act provides for an increase in the weekly rate of State Pension Contributory where the claimant has a qualified adult.  A &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; is defined in the Act and is generally the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a claimant who is wholly or mainly maintained by that person, subject to certain conditions.  As the State pension contributory is a PRSI based payment it is not means tested. However where a person wishes to claim for a qualified adult the income and assets of the qualified adult are assessed.  Articles 7, 8 and 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 142 of 2007) contain provisions with regard to qualified adults.</p><p>On the other hand, eligibility for State Pension Non-Contributory is means tested and takes into account the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.  Capital, property (excluding a person's home), savings and investments are assessed as capital and a formula is then used to assess the weekly means from capital.  The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.  Schedule 3, Part 3 of the Act provides for rules as to calculation of the means of a person who is one of a couple living together as follows &ndash;</p><p>(a) the means of the person is taken to be one-half of the total means of the couple;</p><p>(b) the person is deemed to be entitled to one-half of all property to which the person or the other member of the couple is entitled or to which the person and the other member of the couple are jointly entitled;</p><p>(c) the means of each member of the couple shall first be determined in accordance with these rules and the total means shall be the sum of the means of each member as so determined.</p><p>Weekly income is calculated or estimated and includes the following -</p><p>- Income from employment or self-employment;</p><p>- Weekly value of income from property which is, or is capable of, being put to profitable use;</p><p>- Income from any other source including but not confined to, savings, investments, rent or periodical payment from the letting or use of property, income from an occupational pension, foreign social welfare payments, income from a trust fund, income under a deed of covenant, other cash income;</p><p>Means from capital is assessed as follows:<table><tr><th>Capital </th><th>Weekly means assessed</th></tr><tr><td>First &euro;20,000 </td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;1 per &euro;1,000 </td></tr><tr><td>Next &euro;10,000 </td><td>&euro;2 per &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Balance</td><td>&euro;4 per &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The payment of an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is determined as follows:</p><p>- Where the means of the adult dependent are assessed as less than &euro;100, a full IQA is paid.</p><p>- Where the means of the adult dependent are assessed as between &euro;100 and &euro;310, a reduced rate of IQA is paid.</p><p>- Where the means of the adult dependent are assessed as more than &euro;310, an IQA is not paid. </p><p>The decision to transfer or dispose of income or property is entirely a matter for the individual concerned.  However, where a Deciding Officer notes that a transfer of assets (income or property) has occurred, by a person in respect of whom a means tested increase for qualified adult is being claimed, s/he will carefully consider all of the facts and circumstances of the individual case. This includes requesting any necessary documentation or evidence in order to determine if that person has directly or indirectly deprived themselves of any income or property in order to qualify for or to improve the weekly rate payable. If evidence in this regard is found, the payment may not be awarded or may be ceased.</p></reply>

The employment supports in place for people with a disability are of a voluntary nature and are tailored to the person&rsquo;s capacity to engage with education, training or job-search programmes. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme.</p><p>In addition, DA recipients are eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities for example through schemes such as Community Employment and JobBridge. For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who have some capacity for work, they can apply for the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme. </p><p>Furthermore, the INTREO service is available to any person with a disability who wishes to avail of the service. People with disabilities may also be eligible to avail of wider social welfare schemes such as the Back to Education Allowance and the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance. </p><p>The data sought by the Deputy in the various questions, where available, are set out in the following tables with the latest available figures. </p><p>Not all of the data requested are specifically collated by the Department &ndash; in relation to the number of job coaches employed under the EmployAbility service, these are employed by independent companies contracted to provide the service which is  supporting almost 3,000 people.</p><p>Data in respect of the workplace equipment adaptation grant scheme, the employee retention grant scheme and the disability awareness training scheme for 2010 and 2011 are not available.  These three grants are demand led schemes that form part of the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities. Given the small size of each of these grants, a separate estimate for each of these schemes is not set out in the revised estimates volume and only actual expenditure is recorded. Furthermore, information on the number of people that benefitted from these grants is not collated.</p><p>Table 1: Estimated Budgetary expenditure (&euro; million): Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), EmployAbility, PCB <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Wage subsidy scheme</th><th>EmployAbility</th><th>Partial capacity benefit*</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>11.61</td><td>8.98</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>11.25</td><td>8.84</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>10.85</td><td>8.84</td><td>13.10</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>10.85</td><td>8.84</td><td>8.50</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>10.85</td><td>9.24</td><td>12.67</td></tr></table>*Partial Capacity Benefit was introduced in February, 2012</p><p>Table 2: Actual expenditure (&euro; million): WSS, EmployAbility, PCB<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Wage subsidy scheme</th><th>EmployAbility</th><th>Partial capacity benefit*</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>10.87</td><td>8.5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>10.06</td><td>8.4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>10.57</td><td>8.10</td><td>2.11</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>11.04</td><td>8.71</td><td>7.37</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>12.59</td><td>8.43</td><td>9.97</td></tr></table>*Partial Capacity Benefit was introduced in February, 2012</p><p>Table 3: Number of participants: WSS, EmployAbility, PCB<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Wage subsidy scheme</th><th>EmployAbility</th><th>Partial capacity benefit*</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>833</td><td>2,550</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>916</td><td>2,903</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1,006</td><td>2,762</td><td>733</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1,159</td><td>2,872</td><td>1,234</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,548</td><td>2,936</td><td>1,432</td></tr></table>*Partial Capacity Benefit was introduced in February, 2012</p><p>Table 4: Number of employers, WSS<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total No. of Employers</th><th>No. of Employers &ndash; Strand 1</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>530</td><td>499</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>577</td><td>525</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>663</td><td>608</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>703</td><td>635</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,022</td><td>881</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 5: Distribution of WSS employers by number of WSS employees (Position as at mid-2013)<table><tr><th>No. of Employees</th><th>No. of Employers</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>2 &ndash; 4</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>5 &ndash; 9</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>10 +</td><td>3 </td></tr></table></p><p>Table 6: Expenditure: Other Grants/Schemes<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Employee retention grant scheme</th><th>Workplace equipment adaptation grant scheme</th><th>Disability Awareness Training Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;4,320</td><td>&euro;71,176</td><td>&euro;2,430</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;81,724</td><td>&euro;834</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;61,776</td><td>&euro;3,760</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record.</p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as it was previously estimated it may cost approximately &euro;160 million annually to backdate to 1953.  In any event, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994.  Consequently, any decision to change the scheme would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced on replacing the current averaging approach used to assess entitlement to the SPC, with a total contributions approach.  As part of this work, the position of those who spent a number of years out of the labour force on home-caring duties will be carefully considered, particularly in the context of ensuring equality of outcomes for women and men.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  It is intended that changes would be announced well in advance of their introduction, to allow workers factor this into their retirement planning.</p></reply>

Child benefit is paid to around 616,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014. Child benefit as a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; payment is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability.</p><p>Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which child benefit is paid from under 19 years of age to under 18 years of age. A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the 18 year age limit for child benefit.</p><p>For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>-  qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments</p><p>-  family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children</p><p>-  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families. </p><p>The Government is conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for families.

This contract, which may be extended up to end December 2019, is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.</p>  <p>  Increasing the scale by which State payments are delivered directly into a client account is a key objective of a number of Government policies.  These include the National Payments Plan, the Department&rsquo;s Payment Strategy, the Public Sector Reform Plan, the e-Government Strategy and other government policies.  These policies support improved customer service, reflect consumer trends and preferences and can deliver administrative savings.</p>  <p>  The Department intends to continue to offer many clients the choice of being paid in cash at the post office, directly into an account in a financial institution or by cheque in some instances.  It is not proposed to limit the freedom of such clients to be paid directly into a financial institution if they so choose.</p>  <p>  Undeniably, this creates a challenge for the current business model of An Post.  But this is not the only challenge. Competition in over the counter cash services, changes in technology and customer retail preferences all contribute to that challenge for An Post services.</p>  <p>  I understand the post office network stands well positioned to be a front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector.  These services will be in both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over the counter transactions.  In this context, I am aware of the plans towards the development and roll out of a new transaction account for customers.  I look forward to An Post making this available in the not too distant future as an alternative banking opportunity for this Department&rsquo;s customers and many others.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.</p>  <p>  Legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  However, the Department does encourage people to engage in voluntary work within the State. Any person who engages in voluntary work may continue to be entitled to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.</p>  <p>  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include:</p>  <p>  -  helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability;</p>  <p>  -  assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations.</p>  <p>  The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups. The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely &ndash; to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so. In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.</p></reply>

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    </p>  <p>  In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures are common, reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. These measures are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency by incentivising them to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. </p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.</p>  <p>  The reduced rates do not apply to a person aged under 25 where such persons were in the care of the Health Service Executive during the year prior to their 18th  birthday. There are no plans to extend this condition to any other group.</p>  <p>  The Department is actively engaging with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall. For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

Membership includes representatives of the community and voluntary sectors, Drugs Task Forces and statutory organisations. A new Programme Framework is currently being developed for drug rehabilitation schemes. The Framework is focused on facilitating the participation of vulnerable adults who are very distant from the labour market and who need special supports. Participants will have access to multiple supports and specialist inputs from social, education and health mainstream services as part of the programme offered under CE. </p>  <p>  Under the National Drugs Strategy (NDS), it is also recognised that the response to substance misuse is a cross-cutting issue.  No single agency has the range of competencies or expertise to provide all the supports needed to assist drug users to complete their rehabilitation. The 2007 Working Group&rsquo;s Report on Rehabilitation highlights the role of CE in relation to the recovery needs of participants in drug rehabilitation.  It recommends that the impact of CE should be built upon by the complimentary support of the HSE, the Department of Education and Science and relevant agencies that play a key role in the overall integrated response to this client group in terms of rehabilitation.  </p>  <p>  The Framework is nearing completion and will greatly improve supports to the 1,000 drug rehabilitation places ring-fenced on CE. The Department intends to monitor the implementation of this new Framework and review the lessons of the implementation and good practice.</p></reply>

This re-rating compensates for approximately 60% of the loss of their OFP payment. </p>  <p>  Lone parents who make the transition from OFP to FIS can also qualify for the back to work family dividend.  The dividend is a new tapered income support that allows recipients of an OFP or Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to retain the qualified child proportion of their former social welfare payment when they move off welfare into employment. This equates to &euro;29.80 per week per child (up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 per week for four children), for two years, with full entitlement (worth &euro;1,550 per child) in the first year and 50% entitlement (worth &euro;775 per child) in the second year.  It should be noted that the Back to Work Family Dividend is an additional top-up to a family&rsquo;s entitlement to FIS. The payment of the dividend will have no impact on a family&rsquo;s FIS entitlement.</p></reply>

The development of this roadmap will be progressed by a Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG).  The broad role of the group is to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring a recommendation for Government consideration in the form of a scheme roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction.  It is hoped to have this work completed by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The URSG is chaired by the Department of Social Protection and comprises officials at Assistant Secretary level or equivalent from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Pensions Authority, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Bank of Ireland.  Membership also includes senior international representatives from the UK&rsquo;s Department for Work and Pensions and the OECD who bring significant expertise in designing, delivering and assessing supplementary pension systems. The Group is being supported by the Pensions Policy Unit in the Department of Social Protection.  </p>  <p>  Two meetings of the URSG have taken place to date. As the Group is managing the deliberative process which will underpin the development of the roadmap, material relating to deliberations will be available after consideration by Government. </p>  <p>  In addition to developing the roadmap, there may be a need to undertake separate and supporting research and analysis to ensure the coherency, feasibility and cost effectiveness of any plan to introduce what will be the most far reaching and progressive reform to pensions policy in recent history.  The budget availability for this research will be informed by the research requirements identified by the URSG. </p>  <p>  In undertaking specific or specialised areas of its work programme the Group will consult with and invite submissions from various sectorial interests such as the pensions industry, representatives of employers, trade unions and consumer/interest groups. The consultation process will also include an open invitation for written submissions from any parties with an interest in this area.</p></reply>

It will give financial support to people with children who were getting jobseeker and one-parent family payments and who take up employment, increase their hours of employment or become self-employed. </p>  <p>  The BTWFD provides support for up to two years after a person moves from social welfare into employment. If a person qualifies for the dividend they will get a weekly payment equivalent of any increases for qualified children that were being paid on their jobseeker or one-parent family payment, up to a maximum of 4 children, for the first year in employment. Half that amount will be paid weekly for their second year in employment. Where payable the dividend will be additional to any entitlement the family may have under the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.</p>  <p>  The BTWFD scheme will commence when the necessary legislation, to be advanced under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, is in place. However applications are currently being accepted. These will be processed following the progression of the legislation and all eligible claims will be backdated to their date of application. This means that eligible applicants from the 5th of January, 2015 to the date of commencement of the scheme will receive arrears of BTWFD and their 2 year period of entitlement, subject to scheme criteria, will run from their date of application.</p>  <p>  While it was originally envisaged that the Bill would be enacted during April, 2015, it is now due to be enacted in early May, 2015. Eligible applicants, who will be in employment or self-employment, will still get their full entitlement under the scheme.</p></reply>

I am informed, in that context, that where an application for the Basic Payment Scheme entitlements is made in respect of a herd number which is in joint names that any entitlements awarded will be owned in those joint names. Given that understanding, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the correct tax treatment in relation to a farmer who has added his or her son or daughter to his or her herd number can only be determined by reference to the specific terms and conditions agreed between the parties and in the absence of this information it is not possible to give a definitive answer. </p>  <p>  However, in general, where for example a parent permits a herd number to be held in joint names with a son or daughter this will be treated as a disposal by a parent of his or her entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme. An entitlement is a chargeable asset for Capital Gains Tax purposes.  Accordingly, any chargeable gain arising on the disposal of such entitlements is ordinarily liable to Capital Gains Tax. The first &euro;1,270 of any gain is exempt from Capital Gains Tax. Where the gain exceeds that amount, Capital Gains Tax will only be charged on the amount in excess of &euro;1,270. The current rate of Capital Gains Tax is 33%. There may also be a Gift Tax implication arising on the disposal of the entitlements but there is a tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 available on disposals between a parent and a son or daughter. In addition, there is an annual &euro;3,000 exemption and, should any Capital Gains Tax be payable on the disposal of the entitlements, the Capital Gains Tax paid is available as a credit against any Gift Tax liability arising as both the Capital Gains Tax and Gift Tax liabilities arise on the same event.</p></reply>

The eRCT system is a much more efficient way for Revenue to actively manage subcontractors' tax compliance risks than the manual processes that would have previously applied in the paper based system. I am aware that the extensive amount of data available from the eRCT system is used by Revenue in their risk analysis systems to determine suitability for compliance interventions. Additionally, the system facilitates the periodic automatic review of the deduction rates of the entire registered subcontractors' case base and the updating of deduction rates to reflect the ongoing compliance record of the subcontractor. This type of review would have been impossible under the old arrangements.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. </p>  <p>  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the assistance with fuel costs used by members of the Scheme, based on provisional figures the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;48.6 million to the Exchequer in 2014, an increase of &euro;5.1 million on the 2013 cost. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. However, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.</p><p>In order to help those who have been affected by flooding, Government policy aims to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme on flood relief measures. Works are completed on a prioritised basis. Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.</p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes.  The outcome of this arrangement, which came into effect in June 2014, is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be in a position to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed. The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.</p><p>The OPW and the Department of Finance will continue contact, including meetings, with Insurance Ireland to review the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding. </p><p>In cases where individuals which are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at </p></reply>

Eleven companies or partnerships expressed interest in participating in the procurement process (of which five were Irish registered companies). Five companies were shortlisted to take part in the competitive dialogue stage (of which two were Irish registered companies). Four companies submitted provisional tenders (of which two were Irish registered companies) and two companies submitted final tenders (of which one was an Irish registered company). The successful bidder was CRIF S.p.A, an Italian company. It was a condition of the tender that any successful bidder would establish an Irish registered company. In February 2015 the Bank signed a contract with CRIF Ireland Limited, a wholly owned Irish subsidiary of the preferred bidder.</p>  <p>  The Bank has now commenced the design of the CCR solution and processes in conjunction with CRIF Ireland Ltd. The Bank continues to engage with representative industry groups to explain its approach and intends to publish a consultation paper in the near future. It is anticipated that 2015 will be spent in developing and testing the technical solutions with relevant stakeholders. The initial phase of the CCR will focus on lending to individuals and is expected to become operational by mid-2016. A later phase will address lending to incorporated entities and is tentatively scheduled to be operational by end-2017.  </p>  <p>  The Credit Reporting Act 2013 sets out the range of personal information which may be held on the CCR, including Name, Date of Birth, Address and Personal Public Service Number (PPSN). The Bank will make regulations specifying the final personal information and credit information to be held on the CCR. The Bank notes that the extent and quality of personal information collected will have a significant impact on the capacity of the CCR to deliver complete and accurate credit reports. The Bank must consult with the Data Protection Commissioner on such regulations and also seek the consent of the Minister for Finance. In advance of such consultation on the regulations the Bank intends to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment to assist in finalising the personal information to be held. The Bank expects that a decision on the specific personal data (including PPSN) to be held on the CCR will be taken in Quarter 4 of 2015. </p>  <p>  The Bank will be registered with the Data Protection Commissioner as the data controller for the CCR.  CRIF Ireland Ltd will be registered as a data processor and will process data in accordance with the instructions of the Bank. CRIF Ireland Ltd will have access to all of the personal and credit information held on the CCR in order to create accurate and reliable credit reports. The agreement between the Bank and CRIF Ireland Ltd contains robust provisions regarding the security and confidentiality of CCR information. These provisions are designed to safeguard sensitive personal information and comply with requirements of the Credit Reporting Act and data protection legislation.</p></reply>

In order to finalise this process, further information may be sought from some creditors in order to validate their claim. </p><p>Following the completion of this process, the Special Liquidators could be in a position to make an interim distribution to creditors later this year, however, it will be some time before the Special Liquidators will be in a position to advise on likely dividends payable, if any, to creditors (including the Exchequer) given:<ol type="1"><li>the early stage in the creditor adjudication process</li><li>the other contingent liabilities that may crystallise from litigation; and</li><li>the future receipts from the sale of the remaining assets.</li></ol>The Special Liquidators are unable to comment at this stage both on the level of proceeds that will ultimately be generated from the liquidation and on the level of valid creditor claims that will ultimately be received in respect of the liquidation. It is the balance between the proceeds generated and level of valid claims that will ultimately determine the dividend to which each creditor may be entitled. </p><p>For the payment of proceeds from the liquidation, unsecured creditors will rank in priority to the holders of subordinated debt. The priority for the distribution of assets under the Companies Acts is generally:<ol type="1"><li>Costs and expenses of the ongoing liquidation;</li><li>Preferential creditors, including certain taxes and employee and pension claims arising prior to the date of liquidation (these claims are certain to be paid in full);</li><li>Amounts owing to NAMA under the Facility Deed acquired from the Central Bank which were secured by a floating charge over the bank's assets (these claims have been fully repaid and the floating charge has been released)</li><li>Unsecured creditors, including: </li></ol>- Debts owing to the Minister/NTMA under ELG</p><p>- Debts owing to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme</p><p>- Unguaranteed debt/depositors</p><p>Other Unsecured Creditors, including:</p><p>- Local authority development bonds</p><p>- Credit unions</p><p>- Suppliers / other &quot;normal&quot; unsecured creditors</p><p>- Employees that are not preferential creditors</p><p>- Contingent creditors and other potential costs principally relating to litigation, etc. </p><p>- Subordinated creditors</p><p>- Members of the company - the Minister currently holds 100% of all shares and preference shares in the company.</p></reply>

Section 37(1) of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides that VAT is chargeable on the full consideration which a taxable person becomes entitled to receive in respect of or in relation to a supply of goods or services "including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever" but not including the Value-Added Tax itself.   </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that their understanding is that, in general, utility providers offer discounts in two ways.  The first is a percentage discount, say 5%, on the standard energy unit price.  The discounted price, in this case 95% of the standard energy unit price, is then used to calculate the VAT-inclusive bill amount.  In this way the customer does not pay VAT on the 5% discount.  The second way is by means of a bill credit or cashback.  The bill credit or cashback amount is offset against the VAT-inclusive bill.  Take, for example, a customer whose VAT-inclusive bill is &euro;227 made up of &euro;200 plus &euro;27 VAT.  If this customer receives a bill credit or cashback of &euro;100 then the customer's bill is only &euro;127.  The utility provider accounts for VAT on the VAT-inclusive amount of &euro;127 (VAT-exclusive amount of &euro;112 plus &euro;15 VAT at 13.5% on the &euro;112) being the full consideration which the provider becomes entitled to receive in relation to that supply.  The customer's bill credit or cashback of &euro;100 is essentially a VAT-inclusive discount made up of a VAT-exclusive amount of &euro;88 plus &euro;12 VAT at 13.5% on the &euro;100).  If this is the practice described by the Deputy then it is in line with VAT legislation.  </p></reply>

A number of these entities are currently unregulated and more details are provided below.</p><p>By end-2014, non-bank entities accounted for 5.6% of all outstanding PDH mortgage loans. Further information is available in Box A on page 31 of Q2 2015 Bulletin available at  . </p><p>It is important to note that not all non-bank entities are unregulated firms. Approximately two thirds of non-bank mortgage accounts are with entities authorised by the Central Bank as retail credit firms.</p><p>All regulated mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, are required to comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), which sets out the statutory consumer protection provisions that all regulated mortgage lenders must comply with when dealing with distressed borrowers. </p><p>The balance of approximately one third of non-bank mortgage accounts is made up of unregulated entities that have acquired mortgage loan books. These firms are not subject to regulation by the Central Bank and are not subject to the provisions of its Codes, such as the CCMA, although many firms have stated that they will voluntarily comply. The Central Bank is unable to comment on firms that may be subject to regulation by the UK Authorities.</p><p>It is my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. </p><p>The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.

Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.</p><p>The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage. </p><p>Neither the Central Bank nor my own Department collect data about the level of distressed mortgages that may have associated payment protection insurance policies that have not been activated.  It is also the case that no breakdown is available of the level of distressed mortgages owned by retired persons.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  As I have stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase. </p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 introduced changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish banking sector. There is some evidence of improvements in the banking sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.  In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.</p>  <p>  I should add that myself and the Governor of the Central Bank meet regularly, the latest of these meetings took place on 2 April. Among the items discussed was the issue of mortgage interest rates. The Governor provided an update on the ongoing work that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.</p>  <p>  We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. The Central Bank will continue to research why this is the case and will publish results shortly. The Governor will update me on progress in due course.</p></reply>

The relief is granted in respect of the profits of a new trade and chargeable gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purposes of the new trade. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on profits relating to the trade to nil where the total amount of corporation tax payable by the company for an accounting period does not exceed &euro;40,000. Marginal relief is granted on a tapering basis where the total amount of corporation tax liability for the accounting period is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;60,000. No relief applies where corporation tax payable for an accounting period is &euro;60,000 or more. </p>  <p>  The relief was first introduced in 2009 and originally applied to certain companies commencing to trade in that year.  This qualifying period has been extended in subsequent Finance Acts, and the relief is now available to qualifying companies commencing to trade up to and including 2015.  As part of one of the early extensions of the relief, in Finance Act 2011, the basis on which relief is computed was changed to link the reduction in corporation tax to the amount of employers' PRSI paid in an accounting period, subject to a limit of &euro;5,000 per employee and an aggregate limit of &euro;40,000. The purpose of this change was to better target the relief at companies generating employment. The changes introduced in Finance Act 2011 apply to all qualifying companies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. However, companies which set up and commenced a qualifying trade in 2009 or in 2010 were able to obtain relief on the previous (i.e. pre-Finance Act 2011) basis for profits earned in accounting periods commencing before 2011.</p>  <p>  Subsequent amendments have also extended the relief to provide that, where a start-up company does not have sufficient profits to claim the relief in a given year, any relief unclaimed in the first three years can be carried forward into future years for use against future corporation tax liabilities.   </p>  <p>  A review of the operation of this relief is taking place this year, to ensure that it meets the policy objectives of creating jobs and activity in Ireland and provides value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-15a.396.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041500060#WRL00700"><p>I would disagree with the Deputy that the purpose of tax reliefs is to allow anyone to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. No tax relief is introduced without a specific purpose in mind and all are reviewed on a regular basis. Where it becomes apparent that any given provision is being abused or is not working to best effect, appropriate action is taken, whether by implementation of anti-avoidance rules or legislative change.</p><p>Details of eliminations and amendments that have been carried out to various tax measures in the period specified by the Deputy are set out below.</p><p><b>High Earners Restriction</b></p><p>A restriction limiting the amount of certain reliefs which can be used by certain high income individuals was originally introduced in the Finance Act 2006, which came into effect from the 2007 tax year. Since 2011, this effectively limits the rate at which individuals, with income in excess of &euro;125,000 per annum, can use a wide variety of tax reliefs and exemptions. This limit is graduated so that individuals with incomes in excess of &euro;400,000 per annum will pay a minimum effective rate of income tax of at least 30%, regardless of how many reliefs they have available. This is chargeable in addition to USC and PRSI.</p><p>The following measures have been included among the reliefs that are taken into account for the purposes of the application of the restriction. </p><p>- For the tax year 2014 onwards, subject to certain conditions, the wear and tear allowance for plant and machinery available to passive lessors (Section 16 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).</p><p>- The Foreign Earnings Deduction (Section 12 Finance Act 2012).</p><p><b>Relief to individuals on loans applied to acquire an interest in partnerships</b></p><p>Relief to individuals on loans applied to acquire an interest in partnerships was abolished for new claimants from 15 October 2013 and reduced on a sliding scale for existing claimants with total cessation from 2017 onwards. This abolition does not include farm partnerships (Section 3 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).</p><p><b>Donation of heritage property</b></p><p>Tax relief for the donation of heritage property was amended in Section 25 of Finance Act 2013 to lower the amount of the market value of the property that qualifies for relief from 80% to 50%.</p><p><b>Film Relief </b></p><p>Prior to 1 January 2015, an individual could, by virtue of section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, claim relief from taxation at his/her marginal rate on amounts not exceeding &euro;50,000 invested in the production of qualifying films in any taxable period. </p><p>Section 24 of the Finance Act 2014 terminated this relief with effect from 1 January 2015.  Support to the film industry is now provided in the form of a corporation tax credit which is payable directly to film production companies.</p><p><b>Income tax losses</b></p><p>Finance Act 2013 and Finance Act 2014 curtailed the relief which individuals could claim for certain 'trade' losses against their other income.  </p><p>- Section 18 Finance Act 2013 amended section 381 TCA1997 to provide that individuals who are engaged in the trade of dealing in or developing land cannot claim loss relief against their other income if that loss arises from interest accrued but not yet paid or from the write down in land values where that land has not been sold. This restriction ensures that only losses which have actually been realised are available to reduce the tax liabilities of land developers.</p><p>- Section 11 Finance Act 2014 introduced two sections (381B and 381C) to the TCA 1997 to curtail the use of losses.Section 381B ensures that individuals can only claim limited loss relief against their other income if the loss arises from a trade which is not carried out in an active and commercial manner.Section 381C provides that where a loss arises from a tax-avoidance arrangement no loss relief is available against that individual's other income.These amendments prevent individuals from accessing tax reliefs in respect of losses arising from the carrying on of 'hobby' trades. And they also prevent the presentation of certain activities as trades for the purposes of reducing an individual's overall tax liability.</p><p><b>USC</b></p><p>From 1 January 2013 an income limit of &euro;60,000 was introduced for access to the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders and individuals aged 70 years.</p><p><b>Foreign Service Relief</b></p><p>Foreign service relief in respect of termination lump sum payments was ceased in respect of payments made on or after 27 March 2013.</p><p><b>Top Slicing Relief</b></p><p>Top Slicing Relief in respect of termination lump-sums paid on or after 1 January 2013 was restricted to the first &euro;200,000 of the aggregate of all termination lump sums received.</p><p>Top Slicing Relief abolished entirely in respect of termination lump-sums paid on or after 1 January 2014.</p><p><b>Pensions</b></p><p>- The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT), which places a limit on the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes, was reduced with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m.  (Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).</p><p>- A Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) which may apply instead of the SFT in certain circumstances was restricted, for new PFT applicants, to a maximum of &euro;2.3m where the capital value of an individual's pension rights on 1 January 2014 exceeded the reduced SFT of &euro;2m. (Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).</p><p>- The valuation factor used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement (and which accrue after 1 January 2014) for SFT/PFT purposes was increased from a factor of 20 to a range of higher age related factors that vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension benefits are drawn down. (Section 18 Finance (No. 2) Act 2013).</p><p>- Vested PRSAs (i.e. personal retirement savings accounts in respect of which benefits have commenced) were brought within the imputed distribution regime with effect from the tax year 2012. Prior to 2012, the regime applied only to approved retirement funds (ARFs). Under the regime, both ARF and vested PRSA owners are treated as &quot;receiving an annual payment&quot; from their ARF and/or vested PRSA calculated as a percentage of the assets held in the funds at the annual valuation date. The rate of the imputed distribution varies with the size of the fund and is chargeable to income tax under Schedule E. (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).</p><p>- The rate of imputed distribution applying to ARFs/vested PRSAs with assets valued in excess of &euro;2m was increased from 5% to 6% with effect from the tax year 2012. (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).</p><p>- The rate of final liability tax applying to a post-death distribution from an ARF to a child (aged 21 or over) of the deceased ARF owner was increased from 20% to 30% with effect from 31 March 2012 (date of passing of Finance Act 2012). (Section 18 Finance Act 2012).</p><p><b>Property Relief Surcharge</b></p><p>Section 531AAE provides for an increase in the Universal Social Charge (USC) in respect of income of certain individuals. It potentially only applies to those whose gross income in the year is at least &euro;100,000 and then only to income which is sheltered by any of the property or area-based incentive reliefs in that year. This means any of the accelerated property capital allowances under any of the incentive schemes as well as the residential lessor relief commonly known as section 23-type relief. The 5% property relief surcharge is payable, in addition to any other USC which the person is obliged to pay on the income in question. </p><p><b>Cap on accelerated capital allowances</b></p><p>There have been many different property relief schemes over the years, each one tailored to address particular regional or sectoral needs, and their rules varied. Although these have all been brought to an end, capital allowances were still being claimed in respect of projects undertaken while the schemes were active. </p><p>Finance Act 2012 introduced a provision which meant that with effect from 1 January 2015, certain passive investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes would no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before that date no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. This lead-in period was intended to give individuals time to adjust to this change in advance. </p><p>This provision is restricted to passive investors only. A person who is entitled to accelerated capital allowances and who is an active trader will not be affected by this measure. In addition, residential (Section 23) and owner-occupier reliefs are unaffected by these measures.</p></reply>

The public interest VAT-exemptions have existed since VAT was introduced, mainly because of the practical difficulties in defining and measuring the value added which would be appropriate as a base for taxation.</p><p>There is a specific VAT Refund Order (SI 58 of 1992) that provides that VAT incurred on the purchase or importation of new medical instruments and appliances (excluding means of transport), which is purchased through voluntary donations, may be refunded to hospitals or donors, as appropriate, subject to conditions.  The Refund Order does not extend to VAT incurred on construction services.  Further information on the Refund Order, its conditions and the refund claim form VAT 72 is available on the Revenue website at  .</p></reply>

Sustainability of a split mortgage (of which there are various designs) will be assessed by the Central Bank inter alia with regard both to the affordability of the un-warehoused debt payment schedule and with regard to the treatment of the warehoused loan at maturity. Transparency to a borrower of the terms and conditions of a split mortgage at the outset of such a solution is essential to the sustainability of this solution, in particular how the bank will treat future increase of income and the repayment of the warehoused loan at maturity. </p><p>The sustainability guidelines outline the Central Bank s views on the key characteristics that we would expect to see in a split mortgage, including inter alia:</p><p>- Treatment of the base loan of a split mortgage;</p><p>- Treatment of future increases in income;</p><p>- Treatment of term of warehoused part of split mortgage. </p><p>The Central Bank s position is that split mortgages will only be considered sustainable if the borrower can service both the base loan and there is an appropriate approach to dealing with the warehoused element. This is consistent with the recognition that each borrower s circumstance will be different and the solutions offered for individual borrower s arrears issues will be driven by their own particular circumstance, so long as this is consistent with the Central Bank s requirements (e.g. CCMA).&quot; </p><p>The following is the link to the sustainability guidelines available on the Central Bank's website and I would draw the Deputy's attention to section 2.5 in particular which deals with split mortgages. </p></reply>

The additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% which I introduced for 2014 and 2015, mainly to help continue to fund Jobs Initiative, will also end after this year. </p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and create new jobs.  These include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and the Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced the ending of the Air Travel Tax from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create thousands of new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment. </p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased and will be ceased as I have already outlined, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy tax collected as may be implied in the question. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons for the levy (the pension scheme trustees and other persons with responsibility for the management of pension scheme or pension plan assets) will benefit from that improving fiscal and economic situation and from the changes that I began in Budget 2015 which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

These thresholds have been reduced in recent years as part of the effort to restore the public finances as taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.  For the same reason the rate has gradually risen from 20% in 2008 to its current rate of 33%.</p><p>The property market continues to improve with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises, and it is recognised that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance of property with respect to CAT thresholds. </p><p>Capital Acquisitions Tax and various elements thereof, e.g. thresholds and rates, will like all other taxes be kept under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

I also pointed out in my previous replies on this matter that it is a complicated matter and the work undertaken by such a body would have to be subject to strict terms of reference.

Its remit would include the provision of costings of alternative budgets on request from Members of the Oireachtas and the costing of election manifestos.  Officials from my Department are currently reviewing this proposal which includes an examination of best practice internationally of independent budget offices, as well as other important issues such as resource implications and the legislative requirements.

It is my intention to ensure that borrowers whose loans are sold by a regulated entity to a currently unregulated entity maintain the same protections as they had prior to the sale. </p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 will require entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February.  Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation.  The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage. </p></reply>

The Basic Payment Scheme has replaced the Single Payment Scheme and payments under the scheme are liable to Income Tax.  The Young Farmers Scheme also provides for an additional payment to any person who commences farming or takes over existing holdings.  It is available for a maximum period of 5 years depending on the year of commencement of farming.</p>  <p>  The correct tax treatment of transfers between a parent and child can only be determined by reference to the specific terms and conditions agreed between the parties.  In the absence of this information it is not possible to give a definitive answer.  However, in general, where for example a parent permits a herd number to be held in joint names with a son or daughter this will be treated as a disposal by a parent of his or her entitlements under the Basic Payments Scheme.  These entitlements under the Basic Payments Scheme are a chargeable asset for Capital Gains Tax purposes.  Accordingly, any chargeable gain arising on the disposal of such entitlements is ordinarily liable to Capital Gains Tax.  The first &euro;1,270 of any gain is exempt from Capital Gains Tax.  Where the gain exceeds that amount, Capital Gains Tax will only be charged on the amount in excess of &euro;1,270.  The current rate of Capital Gains Tax is 33%.  There may also be a Gift Tax implication arising on the transfer but there is tax free threshold of &euro;225,000 available on transfers between a parent and son or daughter.  In addition, there is an annual &euro;3,000 exemption and should any Capital Gains Tax be payable on the transfer, the Capital Gains Tax paid is available as a credit against any Gift Tax liability arising as both the Capital Gains Tax and Gift Tax liabilities arise on the same event.</p></reply>

Traders must apply for a new licence annually and Revenue may refuse to issue a licence or may revoke an existing licence.  Revenue began taking action from mid- 2011 against service stations that were unlicensed and also against some stations that had failed to adhere to the conditions of their licences.  Unlicensed service stations were closed as a result of the seizure of fuel by Revenue or the threat of such seizure.  In addition, service stations that had their licences revoked for breaches of licensing conditions were similarly closed as a result of the seizure of fuel or the threat of seizure.In all, over 130 such closures have taken place  from mid-2011 to date.</p><p>The Commissioners inform me that they maintain a register of auto fuel and marked fuel traders' licences on the Revenue website.

Since the 1970s the zero rate of VAT has applied to animal feeding stuff excluding feeding stuff which is packaged, sold or otherwise designated for the use of dogs, cats, cage birds or domestic pets.   Therefore, Ireland was permitted under Article 110 to retain the zero rate for such animal feeding stuff.  Greyhound feeding stuff was liable to VAT at the standard rate since the introduction of VAT.  The Finance Act 1995 introduced a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, for greyhound feeding stuff that is packaged, advertised or held out for sale solely as greyhound feeding stuff, and that is supplied in units of not less than 10 kilograms.  The reduced rate is the lowest VAT rate on greyhound feeding stuff that is permitted by the EU VAT Directive.</p></reply>

In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary claimant.  In addition, a secondary claimant who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, is not entitled to the SPCCC, regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that where a primary claimant qualifies for the SPCCC and chooses to retain it, a secondary claimant would have no access to the credit in any event.</p>  <p>  There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code.  Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example. </p>  <p>  While I understand the difficulties being experienced by those that lose the SPCCC, I am satisfied that the credit targets limited Exchequer resources to where they are needed most.  It is also the case that a person's tax liabilities change from year to year depending on changes in their personal circumstances and whether they continue to meet the qualifying conditions for any tax credits or reliefs that they claim.  In this particular case, the qualifying conditions for the SPCCC are no longer being met and I have no plans to bring forward amendments to the credit to allow for such cases.</p></reply>

The equivalent rates prior to that date were 10% per annum (0.0273% per day) and 12% per annum (0.0322% per day).  These statutory charges are designed to compensate the Exchequer for loss of revenue through late payment of tax, to encourage timely payments in future and to ensure equity for those taxpayers who pay on time.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that regardless of the statutory basis for the imposition of interest in respect of late payment of tax, it always notifies taxpayers in advance of the first interest charge being imposed that continued late payment will result in the sanction being applied retrospectively unless behaviour changes.</p>  <p>  In regard to outstanding tax liabilities generally, I am aware that Revenue's clear preference is always to engage positively with viable taxpayers or businesses experiencing temporary cashflow difficulties rather than deploying the various sanctions at its disposal to secure payment.  However this can only happen where there is honest and open engagement by the taxpayer/business in identifying and agreeing a mutually acceptable solution.  Where there is no such engagement then Revenue has no choice but to use its debt collection/enforcement options, including charging interest on late payments as appropriate to protect the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Therefore, taking account of Revenue's overall balanced approach to charging interest on late payment of tax, which is both effective and reasonable, I have no plans to revise the rates currently applied at this time.</p></reply>

NewERA now provides financial and commercial advice to the relevant Ministers in relation to the six key commercial State companies in the NewERA sectors of energy, water, telecommunications and forestry.  The companies in question are ESB, EirGrid, Ervia, Bord na Mona, Irish Water and Coillte. </p>  <p>  As part of the reform, NewERA, in conjunction with the relevant Government Departments, has developed a Shareholder Expectations Framework which is intended to provide clarity and guidance for each of the companies in relation to the Government's strategic priorities, policy objectives, and financial performance and reporting requirements.  One of the key areas addressed as part of this shareholder expectations framework is dividend policy.  To-date the boards of ESB, EirGrid, Bord na Mona and Coillte have respectively engaged with NewERA and the relevant Government Departments with a view to developing a new formal dividend policy, striking an appropriate balance between the payment of dividends and re-investment in the business.</p>  <p>  A new dividend policy for ESB, as announced by ESB in October 2013, will see ESB increase its dividend payout to 40% of normalised profits after tax by 2017, subject to ESB sustaining a minimum credit rating of BBB+.  </p>  <p>  The Board of EirGrid recently agreed a new dividend framework based on factors that EirGrid have set out in its recently published annual report. This has led to the Board of EirGrid recommending a dividend of &euro;3m based on its financial results for the year end 30 September 2014.</p>  <p>  Significant levels of organisational and structural change have occurred and are continuing within Ervia including the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, the establishment of Irish Water and preparation for the transfer of the gas network assets and liabilities of Ervia and Gaslink to a newly established subsidiary of Ervia called Gas Networks Ireland. Dividends to the State arising from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy are expected to be up to &euro;1bn, of which the first &euro;150m was paid in 2014.  The process of reviewing levels of future dividends and agreeing a dividend policy based on the future financial performance of Gas Networks Ireland is expected to commence shortly. In the medium term it is not envisaged that any dividends will be paid from Irish Water.</p>  <p>  In the case of Bord na Mona and Coillte, the Boards of these entities are currently giving consideration to the development of a formal dividend policy, in consultation with NewERA.</p>  <p>  In this way, a new formal dividend policy has been or will be agreed for each of the NewERA companies, thus giving greater clarity and certainty in relation to the State's future expectations in this regard.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with other relevant Departments, reviewing the shareholder management and oversight arrangements applying across the wider commercial state sector - i.e. in those commercial State companies which do not currently come under NewERA's remit.  The intention is to introduce a more structured and consistent approach to the management and oversight of these companies also, and thus the entire commercial State sector, modelled on the approach already adopted for the NewERA companies adapted, as appropriate, for the particular circumstances of each individual company.  This will include establishing a Shareholders Expectations Framework for each such company, which will include the development of a specific and appropriate dividend policy for each such company.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding our improving economy, because of the magnitude of these reductions, the Exchequer could not sustain the immediate restoration of such reductions.  </p>  <p>  I have indicated that, following receipt of the 1st Quarter Exchequer returns and engagement with my Government colleagues, it is my intention to engage with Public Service Unions regarding the gradual unwinding, in parallel and consistent with our improving economy, of the emergency measures implemented under the FEMPI Acts.  Any discussions on pay will, of course, take place in the context of the State's fiscal position and the pace of financial recovery for this year and 2016. Any proposed changes to the FEMPI legislation will be subject to Government approval and will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Public service pay rates will continue to be frozen in 2015 the 7th consecutive year in which there will have been no pay increases for public servants and, as we know, there have been 2 or 3 actual cuts in wages over that period.  The Government is now planning  for the development of a sustainable public service pay and pensions policy that will continue to support our ongoing economic recovery over the medium term.</p></reply>

Of this total of &euro;19.6m, a total sum of &euro;1,144,800 was allocated to Galway County Council (GCC) for coastal protection repair works under the Government Decision.  The local authorities, including GCC, submitted to the Office of Public Works (OPW) programmes of coastal protection repair works setting out how they intended to spend their allocations.  The amount included in GCC's submission to the OPW in respect of coastal protection works at Lower Road Mainistir and Kilmurvey, Inis M&oacute;r was &euro;120,000 for repair works and &euro;720,000 for strengthening works. The OPW informed the Council that, in accordance with the terms of the Government Decision, the repair element only of the listed projects in its programme of works was approved for funding.</p>  <p>  The works to repair damaged coastal protection structures at Kilmurvey and Mainistir were completed in 2014 and the Council drew down &euro;111,392 from the OPW out of the amount of &euro;120,000 approved for this work.  To date the Council has drawn down &euro;907,099 of the total allocation of &euro;1,144,800 for storm damage repairs.  The balance of the allocation is available for draw down this year.  The OPW has informed the Council that some flexibility would be allowed as regards adjustment of the cost of individual projects and inclusion of a proportionate element of strengthening works, subject to the overall cost not exceeding the total allocation of &euro;1,144,800.</p>  <p>  It should be noted also that GCC included a separate amount of &euro;100,000 in its initial submission to the D/EC&amp;LG following the storms in respect of the cost of road repairs at Lower Road Mainistir and Kilmurvey.  The provision and drawdown of this funding is a matter between GCC and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  The Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, are published on the OPW website, www.opw.ie.  It is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets.  A Local Authority may apply to the OPW for support under the scheme having regard to those eligibility criteria.  Application forms are available on OPW's website under Flood Risk Management and decisions are made having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.</p></reply>

Following a review of the report, the OPW sought additional information and clarification from LCC in May 2014 in relation to the consultants' conclusions and recommendations, including further details regarding the nature of the proposed works and the basis of the economic benefit attributed to them.  OPW and LCC officials met on 1st April 2015, at the Council's request, to discuss the issues involved.

The dates in question are 15 May to 30 September, weather permitting.  These are virtually the same dates as in 2014 (16 May - 29 September), so there has been no curtailment of the length of the season.</p>  <p>  In previous years, there has been pressure from local interests to access the island earlier than Mid-May.  It has been advised on many occasions in the past in response to such demands that this is not possible due to the significant amount of work that needs to be done in the period immediately prior to the official opening.  During this period, the site needs to be prepared to receive visitors by the execution of significant Health and Safety preparations for the season carried out.  In particular, after the winter  the site has to be fully assessed, any hazards cleared from public areas and any necessary repairs carried out.  These vital preparatory works are essential in advance of opening the island to the public.</p>  <p>  It is undeniable that, in previous years certain Boatmen have ignored the published visitor season dates and landed visitors on the Island when it remains in an unsafe, unprepared condition and is without Guides who provide the trained emergency response including radios, defibrillator, oxygen, first aid etc.  In 2014 in particular, visitors were landed on the Island in early May in the middle of a particularly hazardous situation brought about by the severe winter storms.  At this time, there were active rockfalls in particular which made the site especially dangerous and enabling the presence of visitors including young children in this scenario, was, in the view of the Commissioners of Public Works, completely irresponsible.  This has prompted them to take direct enforcement action this year.</p>  <p>  In consultation with the relevant officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport the OPW has agreed to the insertion of the season dates in the relevant DTTAS Passenger Licence which is required for the carriage of passengers to Skellig Michael.  This will mean that any landings on the Island outside the relevant dates will constitute a breach of the Department's Licence Conditions.  Boatmen will however still be permitted to sail to Skellig Michael with visitors and circumnavigate the Island, as a considerable number frequently do, without any fear of breaching the conditions of their Licence.</p></reply>

It will mean that for Community Sports Clubs that can have a bar, it will only be the commercial parts of their premises that will be valued for rates purposes rather than a valuation of all of their premises which is what happens under the current legislation. I am pleased to have been able to introduce an amendment which will give relief to local sports clubs who fulfil an important role in our communities and to resolve a long standing anomaly in the legislation.  </p>  <p>  If enacted, the Commissioner of Valuation will initiate a process of updating the valuation lists for Community Sports Clubs that will benefit from the amendment to Schedule 4.  This process will involve seeking information from Community Sports Clubs so that the necessary changes to the valuation lists can be made.  Any changes resulting from an amendment to Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 will be made in 2015 and will be effective for rates purposes in 2016.

This follows the 2013 judgement by the Supreme Court in the McGowan case which made the registration of employment agreements, including those governing sectoral terms and conditions, invalid.  The main purpose of the legislation is twofold.  Firstly, it will provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions governing terms and conditions in individual enterprises.  Such agreements will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties.</p>  <p>  The Bill will, separately, provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of &ndash; in effect a framework to replace the former sectoral REA system. In this context, the new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter.  If the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the new legislation has been complied with by the Labour Court, he shall make the Order.  Where such an order is made it will be binding across the sector to which it relates, and will be enforceable by the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>  <p>  The proposed legislation has completed pre-legislative scrutiny and is due to be published shortly.</p></reply>

In developing these proposals Minister Bruton and I have been keen to respect the positions articulated by stakeholders to develop proposals that sustain our voluntary system, but also ensure that workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air grievances about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined based on those in similar companies and not be victimised for doing so.</p>  <p>  I expect this legislation to be published during this D&aacute;il session and enacted as expeditiously as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.   The key objectives of the study are:</p>  <p>- To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.</p>  <p>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.</p>  <p>- To enable the Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p>  <p>  The study will have a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.  The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts.  The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The study may also identify how the information gap might be addressed in the future.</p>  <p>  Unlike the position in the UK, Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that where employees suffer a loss by not being given the hours they were requested to work or be available for work, they can be compensated for 25% of the time or 15 hours, whichever is less.  There is no equivalent provision in the UK, where employees on zero hours contracts are only paid for time spent working and if they are not given any hours by their employer they receive no compensation.</p>  <p>  A wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to the study and I expect the study, which commenced in February, to be completed within six months.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.</p></reply>

The numbers have been declining since the economic crisis in 2008.  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for this scheme if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.</p><p>The 2013 report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on extending social insurance coverage for the self-employed found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  </p><p>My Department provides a range of supports for SMEs.  Since this Government came to Office in March 2011, it has worked across its various Departments and agencies to ensure that all enterprises have access to appropriate finance for both working capital and investment. </p><p>In order to assist SMEs to grow and create jobs, my Department put in place two novel credit schemes: the Microenterprise Loan Fund (managed by Micro Finance Ireland) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme to support viable enterprises, from all sectors, who have been refused bank credit.  Both schemes have been the subject of review and appropriate improvements to both schemes are in train.  My Department also provides a range of grants, equity and venture capital finance through its agency, Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Office network provides a range of financial and non-financial supports to help enterprises at start-up or during business expansion phases, including acting as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO.  Further information can be found on the LEO website at .</p><p>The Minister for Finance has recently established the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  The SBCI will the ensure access to flexible funding for Irish SMEs by facilitating the provision of:</p><p>- Flexible products with longer maturity and capital repayment flexibility, subject to credit approval;</p><p>- Lower cost funding to financial institutions which is passed on to SMEs; and</p><p>- Market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, creating real competition.</p><p>Further information on cross-Government initiative to help enterprises, entrepreneurs and start-ups may be found on the Supporting SMEs Online Tool at .</p><p>Other recent supports for SMEs include changes to the Seed Capital and Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Schemes which provide more tax relief in respect of business investment.  The EII is being amended to raise company limits, increase the holding period by 1 year and include medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas and internationally traded financial services.  The Seed Capital Scheme is being revised and made easier to access, with eligibility extended to individuals who have been unemployed up to 2 years.  The new Scheme will be called &ldquo;Start-Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs&rdquo; (SURE).</p><p>I am confident that the supports in place for SMEs will help further develop this vital contributor to economic growth in Ireland.</p></reply>

Microfinance Ireland (MFI) was established to manage and control the Microenterprise Loan Fund.  I provided a &euro;10 million Exchequer allocation to MFI in 2012 which will be supplemented by &euro;5 million from the three main banks to cover the first 5 years of the Fund.  There is scope within the legislation for further funding to be provided in the future.</p>  <p>  MFI provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p>  <p>  The latest figures which are published each quarter on my Department&rsquo;s website show that MFI had, up until the end of 2014, received 887 applications with 704 applications fully processed.  Overall there had been a 59% approval rating  with loans of &euro;6.3 million approved at that point.  MFI applications are required to complete a standard loan application form which is available from MFI&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible micro, small and medium enterprises. and can facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending per year.</p>  <p>  The latest figures which are published each quarter on my Department&rsquo;s website, up to end of 2014, show that 162 CGS facilities totalling almost &euro;22 million had been sanctioned resulting in 649 new jobs being created and 333 jobs maintained.

These are known as late filing penalties and include monetary fines and loss of audit exemption for two years.  The purpose of the review was to assess the proportionality of those penalties.  The CLRG concluded that no change should be made to the level of late filing penalties but it did make a recommendation that where a company seeks a waiver from the payment of late filing fees, the grant of that should not be within the powers of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), but rather should be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, preferably the District Court.  The recommendation was given effect in Section 343 (7) of the Companies Act 2014. I hope to commence the 2014 Act from the 1st June 2015.</p>  <p>  Since the late filing fees were introduced in 2001 there has been a significant increase in compliance by Irish companies with their annual filing obligations.  Whereas prior to 2001, only 13% of companies filed their annual returns on time, currently over 90% of companies file on time.</p>  <p>  I am informed that all companies are advised of their responsibilities under the Companies Acts at the time of incorporation, including their statutory obligations regarding the filing of annual returns and the fact that failure to file annual returns on time results in late penalties, loss of audit exemption and potentially prosecution.</p>  <p>  The CRO provides information on its website about these requirements and also issues reminder letters to companies in advance of their Annual Return Date to remind them of their obligations to file annual returns.</p></reply>

It is heartening that the latest employment data for those engaged in manufacturing shows a significant increase since those reports were commissioned, representing an increase of about 13,000 jobs, meaning that we are well on the way to achieving the projected increase of 20,000 by the end of 2016.  Taking into account both direct and indirect jobs, the sector now supports a workforce of about 437,000 people. </p>  <p>  In relation to the initiative referred to by the Deputy, I arranged for this research project to look at the business case for the possible establishment of an Innovative or Advanced Manufacturing Facility to be included in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, as it is apparent that there may be a gap in Ireland's&rsquo; infrastructure for the support of manufacturing, especially in relation to the provision of research and training. </p>  <p>  Organisations have not made submissions to my Department as part of this exercise.  The process adopted is that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working on developing a detailed business case and these Agencies are interacting directly with key stakeholders.  They have initiated a number of workshops involving over 50 companies, from both the Multinational and Irish-owned sectors.  An Industry Steering Group has been established and input from this Group and from Science Foundation Ireland is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Given the ongoing status of the initiative it would be premature to anticipate at this stage what the final recommendation will be in relation to possible establishment, format and finances of a possible Centre.  It is intended that this assessment process will be completed by Quarter 3 of this year, as specified in the Action Plan for Jobs.</p></reply>

Ireland's labour market is part of a much greater EEA labour market which affords a considerable supply of skilled workers.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought to hire a non-EEA national.</p><p>The Employment Permit (Amendment) Act 2014 provides the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response.  The Regulations, as provided for in the Act, are being reviewed and adapted on a biannual basis to reflect the exigencies of a changing enterprise environment.  They, inter alia, stipulate two types of occupation for the purposes of the employment permits system:</p><p>- The Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations Lists (HSEOL) sets out the lists of eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and are in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This list is an integral part of the <i>Critical Skills Employment Permit</i>which is designed to attract highly skilled people into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.</p><p>The Ineligible Categories of Employment List includes those occupations for which there is a clear surplus of adequately skilled Irish and EEA nationals in the wider labour force.</p><p>My Department has devised a process of reviewing and updating the HSEOL and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SMLRU - SOLAS).  It also involves input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, and industry as necessary.</p><p>The EGFSN&rsquo;s <i>Annual Skills Bulletin</i>contributes principally to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  This Bulletin draws on data on employment, vacancies, job announcements and immigration and other qualitative information held in the National Skills Database (in SOLAS), to identify imbalances in the Irish labour market at occupational level.</p><p>The inclusion of chiropractors on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List was informed by this formalised evidence-based process.  This periodic review process provides an opportunity to interested parties to make representations to me, as Minister, on the composition of the lists.  Accordingly, my Department is considering the matter as part of its current review of the lists which it is intended will be finalised in May.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the data will be available by the end of April 2015.  I will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.   It should be noted that site visits are only one part of a longer negotiation process between IDA Ireland and a client company and it is important to note that data on site visits is not a true measure or does not reflect the level of FDI activity in a Region or County.  Depending on the sector, scale and complexity of the investment won by IDA Ireland, there could be a lead in period of up to 3 to 5 years before an investment is fully implemented as approved.  The final decision on where to locate an investment does, and always will, ultimately reside with the client company.</p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland comes from the existing client base.

The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.  The key objectives of the study are:</p><p>- To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.</p><p>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.</p><p>- To enable the Minister to make any <i>evidence-based</i>policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.</p><p>The study will have a broad scope, covering both the public and private sectors, with a particular focus on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.  The study may also identify how the information gap might be addressed in the future.</p><p>Unlike the position in the UK, Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that where employees suffer a loss by not being given the hours they were requested to work or be available for work, they can be compensated for 25% of the time or 15 hours, whichever is less. There is no equivalent provision in the UK, where employees on zero hours contracts are only paid for time spent working and if they are not given any hours by their employer they receive no compensation.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to the study and I expect the study, which commenced in February, to be completed within six months.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the study&rsquo;s findings.</p></reply>

The trade union is seeking to engage with the company on these issues and the matter was referred by the union to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 in October of last year.</p>  <p>  The company was not represented at the Labour Court hearing. In this regard, the Court found it regrettable that the company declined to participate in the investigation of the dispute or to put forward its position on the union's claims.</p>  <p>  In its recommendation of 14th November 2014, the Court reaffirmed earlier recommendations it had made by noting that the Company and the union were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1996 which provides a procedural framework within which industrial relations disputes and differences arising between the parties can be resolved by negotiation and dialogue. The Court pointed out that the dictates of good industrial relations practice requires parties to honour their collective agreements in both spirit and intent.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the company decided against attending the Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard. In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.</p>  <p>  I would urge both parties to avail of the services of the State&rsquo;s industrial Relations machinery who remain available to assist the parties, in a flexible manner and without prejudice to positions of principle that may be held by any party. It is my opinion that engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.  However, I would like to see an early and fair settlement to this dispute.</p>  <p>  As regards representation rights, Cabinet approval was obtained at the end of 2014 to legislate for an improved framework for workers who are in dispute with their employer regarding their terms and conditions in situations where there are no arrangements with their employer to resolve the matters through collective bargaining.</p>  <p>  When enacted this legislation will mark the fulfilment of one of the most significant commitments in the Programme for Government which indicated that reform in this area was needed. In developing these proposals Minister Bruton and I have been keen to respect the positions articulated by stakeholders to develop proposals that sustain our voluntary system, but also ensure that workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air grievances about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined based on those in similar companies and not be victimised for doing so.  I expect this legislation to be published during this D&aacute;il session and enacted as expeditiously as is possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC.  The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.  Accordingly, the 2001 Act provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.</p>  <p>  Further, Section 13(5) of the 2001 Act contained provisions in relation the preparation and publishing of a Code of Practice by the Labour Relations Commission in relation to the steps that could be taken by employers for the purposes of Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement. Clause 5.3 of the Framework Agreement provided that, as far as possible, an employer should give consideration to a request by workers to transfer from full-time work to part-time and vice-versa.  The Labour Relations Commission prepared this Code of Practice, based on the provisions in Section 13 of the 2001 Act, following consultation with the social partners.  It was deemed to be a Code of Practice and implemented, in 2006, by the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 8 of 2006).  Under Section 42(4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the Code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings before a Court, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Equality Tribunal.</p>  <p>  I understand that IBEC and ICTU were involved in the process of drafting the Directive&rsquo;s Framework Agreement at European level through the European social partner organisations.  At national level, a tripartite group involving this Department, ICTU, IBEC and other relevant Government Departments was established to consider the measures necessary for implementing the Directive in Ireland prior to publication of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Bill 2000.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland has met its responsibilities in transposing EU Council Directive 97/81/EC into national law.  This position is confirmed by a 2003 report on the implementation of the Directive undertaken by the European Commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-15a.598.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041500065#WRQ01100"><p>The new <i>EaSI </i>programme 2014-2020, managed by the European Commission and totalling EUR 919 million, consists of three axes which build on previous EU programmes, namely PROGRESS, EURES and Progress Microfinance. Under <i>EaSI,</i>Progress Microfinance has become Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship.<b></b>Organisations that can apply for funding under the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis are public and private bodies established at national, regional or local level and providing microfinance for persons and micro-enterprises and/or financing for social enterprises. Critically, applications for participation do not require State involvement and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation does not have a direct role in the implementation of the Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis of the <i>EaSI </i>Programme. It is overseen directly by the European Commission.</p><p>One of the objectives of <i>EaSI </i>is &ldquo;promoting employment and social inclusion by increasing the availability and accessibility of microfinance for vulnerable groups and micro-enterprises and by increasing access to finance for social enterprises.&rdquo;</p><p>Over EUR 86 million have been earmarked through Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship to stimulate, broaden and speed up the development of the social finance markets across Europe between 2014 and 2020. Its funding will be evenly spread between microfinance and social entrepreneurship, with a minimum of 45 % going to each. Cross-cutting projects will account up to 10 %.</p><p><i>Microfinance Ireland</i>(MFI) is the selected intermediary for the micro-finance strand which will continue to facilitate access to microfinance for individuals and micro-enterprises. In November 2012, MFI and the European Investment Fund (EIF) signed an agreement under the European Progress Microfinance Facility (Progress Microfinance). This initiative is managed by the European Investment Fund on behalf of the Commission and the European Investment Bank. The EIF does not provide direct financing to micro-entrepreneurs, micro-businesses or individuals. Financing is made available through intermediaries participating in the Facility. Each agreement is negotiated individually and is subject to approval by the European Commission following due diligence. Applications for participation do not require State involvement.</p><p>While continuing the microfinance support as under the current programme, Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship will include several new elements:</p><p>- Funding for capacity-building in microfinance/social enterprise institutions &ndash; the EaSI-Microfinance Social Entrepreneurship Work Programme includes activities to support capacity-building activities for microfinance and social entrepreneurship. Such funding could take multiple forms and could be used, for example, by a microcredit provider to buy an IT system.</p><p>- Investments for developing and expanding social enterprises &ndash; the European Commission has been developing the new financial instrument for social entrepreneurship<b></b>to promote social entrepreneurship by making available hybrid financing for social enterprises in the form of a combination of equity, quasi-equity, loan instruments and grants. Complementarity will be ensured between these actions and those undertaken in the framework of cohesion policy and national policies. The total amount that a social enterprise can receive is &euro;500,000, while respecting state aid rules. Programme support will be limited to enterprises not listed on the stock market, with a turnover or annual balance sheet not exceeding &euro;30 million.</p><p>I welcome the progress made by the European Commission in devising and publishing a new standard to allow social enterprises of all sizes to better measure and demonstrate their social impact and so help them in their discussions with partners, investors, and public sector funders. The standard will help European social enterprises to benefit from EU level funding via <i>EaSI </i>and the European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEF).</p><p>I should point out that a number of Government Departments are engaged with the Social Enterprise sector.  The State currently provides substantial funding to Social Enterprises through a range of programmes and schemes. These include the Community Services Programme managed by Pobal for the Department of Social Protection, Community Employment schemes, the Wage Subsidy Scheme for the employment of people with disabilities, public sector contracts through the HSE and others, the Social Finance Foundation, and LEADER and Local Community Development Programme (LCDP) funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

Clearly a larger programme of supports would have incentivised more productive investments. Despite that, and the particular issues faced by the sector over the period, BIM advised me that the value of the sector held steady over the period, as did the overall employment although volume of production did fall for specified reasons as set out in my reply of 10<sup>th</sup>March 2015.  I believe that significant growth can be anticipated in the coming years through increased investment. The potential for growth and job creation in the aquaculture sector has been widely recognised internationally over a number of years.</p><p>The <i>Maritime Agenda for Growth and Jobs</i>(Limassol Declaration) adopted on 8 October 2012 by European Ministers for maritime policy and the European Commission placed a particular emphasis on the potential of the Blue Economy to contribute to economic recovery in the EU. The Agenda focused in particular on 5 areas of high potential, including aquaculture. From a national perspective, <i>Food Harvest 2020</i>recognises the potential of the seafood sector, in particular aquaculture and seafood processing, to contribute to employment growth and aims to increase employment in the seafood sector from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020. This potential is echoed in <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015</i>.</p><p>On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. I am inviting submissions on that draft Programme by 1 May 2015. The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. Those investment plans will be supported by a new National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture, which I will publish for public consultation shortly. Through that National Strategic Plan and targeted investment under the Seafood Development Programme I will be seeking to identify all of the issues affecting the sustainable growth of the sector and the policy actions and supporting investment needed to address those issues. Strategic Environmental Assessments will accompany both the National Strategic Plan and Seafood Development Programme.</p></reply>

The stakeholders referred to are those who are members of Advisory Councils established under the CFP. Environmental stakeholders are active members of the North Western Waters Advisory Council (NWWAC) and the Pelagic Advisory Council (PAC) &ndash; the two Advisory Councils of importance to Ireland.  Under the reformed CFP, Member States with a direct management interest in a particular region may propose joint recommendations on fisheries management to the Commission. Prior to making any recommendation, those Member States must consult with the relevant Advisory Council.</p>  <p>  In North Western Waters, a regional Group of Member States (Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Spain, France and Belgium) is currently engaged in discussions with a view to forming a joint recommendation on a Discards Plan for demersal species that would come into effect in 2016. Ireland currently chairs this Group and representatives of the relevant Advisory Council &ndash; the NWWAC &ndash; have been invited and attended all meetings of this Group and their views fully taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the phasing in of the landing obligation under the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, I established a national Discards Implementation Group (DIG) under the Chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley. The remit of this Group is to advise me on issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry. The primary aim of the group is ensure that the Irish fishing industry are fully prepared for, and engaged in, the practical implementation of the discards ban.</p>  <p>  As it is the fishing industry alone that will be directly impacted by the implementation of the landing obligation I considered it appropriate that the membership of the Group consist of fishing industry representatives and the relevant agencies - the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>  <p>  I am of course aware of the interest of Irish environmental non-governmental organisations in the work of the group and since the establishment of the Group.  I have asked that they are kept updated on its deliberations on a regular basis and this will of course continue. I do not consider it necessary that they become part of the DIG given its particular remit in terms of practical implementation as opposed to policy development. I consider that they have every opportunity to input into discussions and inform advice within the Advisory Councils.</p></reply>

The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them. The situation in Ireland has not changed since the Single Payment Scheme was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme at the beginning of 2015. Eligible lands include those lands with herbaceous grasses and other grazable vegetation. In Ireland, the main type of vegetation other than grasses is heather and this continues to be eligible for payment where it is grazable.  I am, however, pursuing options that may assist farmers, who have marginal lands, in particular those that have designated land, in meeting the requirements of the Direct Payment regulations. My Department officials are in direct contact with the EU Commission with the intention of pursuing all possible options and bringing the matter to an early conclusion.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 states, &lsquo;Ireland will keep the possible use of financial instruments under review during the programming period&rsquo;.  My Department and I have been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market. This credit is available, subject to qualifying criteria, at favourable terms (i.e. longer term and lower interest rate) for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p>  <p>  In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I have recently been in contact with the main banks. I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector. In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead. I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations. I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.</p></reply>

Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are currently in place facilitating all currently registered uses. These MRLs are currently under review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the EU.  To date, no EU, or indeed OECD countries, have taken a negative regulatory position on Glyphosate and currently <i>all</i>EU Member States have extant glyphosate registrations.

Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 states, &lsquo;Ireland will keep the possible use of financial instruments under review during the programming period&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market. This credit is available, subject to qualifying criteria, at favourable terms (i.e. longer term and lower interest rate) for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.</p>  <p>  In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I have recently been in contact with the main banks. I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector. In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead. I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations. I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.</p></reply>

This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement and I am pleased to report that it is also recognised by both sides in the EU/US negotiations as the basis for the TTIP agreement. Equally it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.</p>  <p>  I have made it clear to the EU Commission, which negotiates on our behalf, that the principle of equivalence, and the right of reservation on policy grounds, must both be respected in the negotiations. This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production. The EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side. In these circumstances, I anticipate that the TTIP agreement will provide adequate protection for Irish consumers against imports of inferior agricultural products. </p></reply>

Among the objectives of the Strategy is to increase the number of people who use State services through the medium of Irish.</p><p>The Programme for Government 2011-2016 states that the Government will support the Strategy and will deliver the achievable goals proposed in the Strategy.</p><p>The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has primary responsibility for matters concerning the Irish language and my Department is fully engaged with that Department to assist in progressing the Strategy and specifically in promoting the use of Irish through an Irish language Scheme.</p><p>In 2006 my Department completed its first Irish Language Scheme and is currently in the process of finalising a new Scheme which it is hoped will further develop and grow the use of the Irish language in my Department. </p><p>The new Irish Language Scheme will outline my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities in promoting the use of the Irish language and will endeavour to promote the Irish Language by a number of means including: </p><p>- The provision of guidelines, information leaflets and application forms in bilingual format;</p><p>- Some Press Releases being made available bilingually on my Department&rsquo;s website;</p><p>- Any meetings held in Gaeltacht areas or when dealing with Gaeltacht/Irish Language issues being attended by staff proficient in Irish;</p><p>- Work continuing towards Irish becoming the working language of my Department&rsquo;s offices located in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>My Department has been able to meet the demand of customers who wish to conduct their business through the medium of Irish. Some staff were encouraged to improve their Irish language abilities by facilitating their attendance at an Irish language course to obtain a Diploma in Irish Studies. I hope that more Irish language courses can be arranged in the future to help increase the number of staff competent to conduct the business of my Department through Irish and English.</p></reply>

The current approval for the export of Irish beef to the US allows &ldquo;intact beef&rdquo; to be shipped. Irish b eef is exported to the US is in the form of primal and subprimal cuts and there are significant commercial opportunities for these, including in the high end food service sector.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated on a number of occasions previously, on the basis of the current price dynamic, there are also opportunities in cheaper manufacturing meat for further processing. As part of an ongoing process, m y   department is working closely with its counterparts in the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to agree protocols with the USA. Significant progress is being made and we are working through the technical aspects with FSIS and the Irish industry.     </p>  <p>  The US beef market is potentially extremely lucrative, with consumption at 11 million metric tonnes annually, which makes this new market such an exciting one for Irish producers. While grass fed is a small volume category compared to conventional or grain fed beef, currently accounting for approximately 10% of total volume, it is estimated to be growing at approximately 20%+ per annum. Consumers in this segment of the market will be a key target in the marketing efforts to promote Irish beef.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to be able to visit the US in February to launch the arrival of Irish beef for the first time there in 16 years and I can report very strong interest from US buyers and distributors in Irish beef. The return of Irish beef to the US market was the result of significant political, technical and diplomatic efforts by my Department, Bord Bia and Irish Embassy in Washington DC. It was a collaborative effort which has borne fruit, with Ireland being the first European country to regain access to the biggest beef market in the world. All of the major Irish beef exporters that accompanied me reported strong interest from US buyers and distributors, which are already leading to commercial deals being signed.</p>  <p>  I am also delighted to see that the first commercial shipments of Irish beef have landed in the US. Indeed the very first shipment was served at the annual Ireland-America Fund attended by the Taoiseach during his Saint Patrick&rsquo;s D   ay visit. This was a huge marketing opportunity to serve our beef to a hugely influential Irish-American network and one which we exploited to the full.</p>  <p>  Currently just 2% of Irish beef exports go outside the EU each year and further diversifying the available markets has been a key element of my strategy for the beef sector for some time. This is a key element in ensuring more sustainable returns to beef farmers and ensuring that an over-reliance on particular markets does not harm the long term prospects of the sector. The key objective for my Department is to provide market access so that industry operators can avail of market opportunities. I am very confident that the opening of the US market is a major step forward in this regard.</p></reply>

Priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, I recently announced that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding, did not benefit from either the Installation Aid or the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;. The result is that this group are eligible to apply to the National Reserve under Phase 2 which open ed for applications on 1 April .   </p>  <p>  With regard to the group of farmers to which the Deputy refers who commenced farming prior to 2008, officials from my Department recently met with representatives of this group to discuss their particular circumstances.</p>  <p>  In establishing the National Reserve I opted for the maximum available 3% of the Basic Payment Scheme financial ceiling which is estimated at providing approximately &euro;24 million in 2015. There has been significant demand for the two priority categories of young farmer and new entrant under Phase 1 the National Reserve. These two priority categories closed for applications on 31 March and the estimated cost of the applications is currently being assessed by my Department. My Department will then have an indication of the level of resource remaining in the National Reserve to cater for the categories under Phase 2 of the Reserve.</p>  <p>  With regard to access to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008, I intend to prioritise their applications under TAMS, with grant-aid payable at 40%, being introduced under the new Rural Development Programme.  EU Commission approval is awaited on the proposed schemes under TAMS.</p></reply>

It provides an EU wide economic assessment of GHG mitigation policy options for EU agriculture by which a 19% and 28% reduction in GHG across EU agriculture might be achieved by 2030.</p><p>The report itself contains the following caveat: &ldquo;It is important to stress that the project results have to be seen in the light of the specific assumptions made. For instance, different assumptions on the availability and uptake of technological mitigation options, and agricultural productivity growth inside and outside the EU could significantly alter the scenario results&rdquo;.</p><p>The analysis confirms what Ireland has been saying in recent years to the Commission. If there are blunt emissions reduction targets for agriculture that do not take account of the limited cost-effective mitigation options, then reduced production and land abandonment is the major risk associated with compliance.</p><p>As a scientific study, the report reinforces the text of the October 2014 European Council Conclusions &ndash; (inter alia):<i>&quot;The multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector, with their lower mitigation potential, should be acknowledged, as well as the need to ensure coherence between the EU's food security and climate change objectives&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the EU and its Member States, have agreed to adopt a new global climate agreement in Paris in December 2015 which will take effect in 2020. Ireland continues to engage in intensive discussions with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent EU approach to the twin challenges of food security (increasing global demand for food in the coming decades) with EU and indeed global climate change ambition. The wording on agriculture and land use in the European Council Conclusions of October 2014 are a welcome step in the right direction.</p><p>The development of the policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030 is hugely important for the land use sectors across the European Union. In our view the policy framework must do three things:</p><p>- Encourage genuinely sustainable land management and forest product uses that contribute to climate change mitigation and retain and enhance soil and forest carbon stocks,</p><p>- Strongly promote sustainable intensification of food production to reduce the carbon intensity of food production and to contribute to both food security and greenhouse gas mitigation objectives, and </p><p>- Seek to move as far along the road to carbon neutrality as is possible in cost-effective terms, while not compromising our capacity for sustainable food production.</p><p>Officials in my Department are continuing to work with colleagues in other Departments to ensure a whole of Government approach to building upon the October European Council text and working with the Commission to ensure that EU and UN climate and food policies to 2030 and beyond recognise these global challenges.</p></reply>

I am cognisant of the role that a resource-efficient agriculture sector can play in contributing to renewable energy targets, especially where it can improve its competitiveness and promote job creation</p><p>My Department in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to encourage the use of animal by-products as &ldquo;valuable by-products not waste&rdquo;. The sustainable use of animal by-products (ABP) can result in wider environmental and economic benefits.  Anaerobic digestion (AD) plants which use animal by-products as a feedstock to produce biogas are subject to processing and hygiene requirements as set out in EU ABP regulation. My Department has drawn up detailed conditions of approval for such plants following consultation with stakeholder representatives in the ABP Consultative Forum.</p><p>In 2006, my Department launched a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme with funding of &euro;4 million in order to provide grant-aid for the installation of anaerobic digesters on ten Irish farms.  To date, one applicant has been paid under the Scheme and I understand that a number of others have expressed interest in commencing on-farm projects. Funding extensions have been granted for that purpose.</p><p>As a large ruminant livestock producer, it is notable that methane contributes a significant portion of Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While it is possible to produce and utilise methane through AD of stored manure, analysis to date would suggest that costs are a significant factor.</p><p>Officials from my Department have contributed to the development of the <i>Draft Bioenergy Plan</i>which was published by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in October 2014. The draft Plan recommends a number of policy and enabling actions including the continued encouragement of the innovative use of animal by-products to produce energy. It also provides for further analysis to be carried out on the costs and benefits of biogas and biomethane.</p><p>In early 2015, the Bioenergy Steering Group was formed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR) with the purpose of furthering the vision set out in the <i>Draft Bioenergy Plan</i>. Four working groups were established, aiming to develop measures on four aspects of Bioenergy: electricity and heat, transport, supply, and research, development and demonstration.  Public and private sector stakeholders will contribute to each working group.  My Department is working closely with DCENR in assessing the potential of bioenergy from the agriculture and forestry sectors, including from AD, to contribute to the 2020 targets contained in the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive. My Department is actively involved in all of the working groups mentioned above. The work of these groups will be important in informing future policy developments in relation to bioenergy. </p></reply>

I would also like to stress that the Regulations were the subject of consultation with all of the farming organisations.</p>  <p>  The reasons for introducing the regulations were twofold. In the first instance, the old TB Order dated from 1989 and had been amended on a number of occasions in the interim. Therefore, it was necessary to codify, modernise and update, in legal terms, the legislation underpinning the TB Eradication Scheme. Secondly, following enactment of the Animal Health Welfare Act 2013, it has been necessary to replace various statutory instruments made under the statute which it has replaced (i.e. the Diseases of Animals Act 1966). The TB Order of 1989 was one of the statutory instruments which had to be replaced in this context. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide a legal underpinning of a number of elements of the TB Programme which have been implemented administratively up to now. This is particularly the case in relation to the on-farm valuation compensation scheme which had been implemented on an administrative basis over the years but is now being put on a legal footing for the first time. The new Regulations also provide a legal basis for the existing &ldquo;farmer pay&rdquo; testing arrangements which have been agreed with the farming bodies for many years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new Regulations will not have any negative impact on general farm husbandry. The position is that the new regulations do not impose any new restrictions on the veterinary treatment of animals. As I explained in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 31 March, it is established practice that the test notification letter which my Department issues to farmers about 6 weeks in advance of the deadline to test advises the farmer to avoid giving routine treatments in advance of the test. The reason for this is to avoid (i) the risk of inadvertently interfering with the test result and (ii) treated animals having to be retained on farms to comply with the post-treatment withdrawal period, thereby prolonging the restriction period. This approach is in line with the key objectives of the Scheme, which are to have reactors removed from the farm as quickly as possible to minimise the restriction period and minimise risk of in-herd spread of the disease. </p>  <p>  I would, however, like to emphasise that a number of mechanisms are built into the arrangements to facilitate farmers in treating their animals. Firstly, farmers are permitted to carry out urgent treatments, including for animal welfare related reasons and this is made clear in the test notification letter. In addition, provision is made for farmers to bring forward the test date in order to facilitate their routine treatment schedules. Provision is also made to address circumstances where a farmer finds it necessary to postpone a test because of particular circumstances. </p></reply>

My Department and the agencies under its remit continue to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to un derpin production in the suckler sector, including through the new Beef Data and Genomics Programme.</p><p><b></b>The Government has made a provision of &euro;52m for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) which forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme and will have a budget of some &euro;300m over a period of 6 years. The proposed BDGP will deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. It will also position Ireland at the global forefront in the application of genomics technology and cement our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export focussed beef producing nations in the world.</p><p>Subject to the approval of the Rural Development Programme by the EU Commission, farmers will be paid for work carried out in a range of areas related to data recording and animal breeding policies. The actions currently being considered for the Programme include recording a range of data relating to performance criteria and animal events, taking tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals and sending onwards for laboratory testing, completing an on-farm Carbon Navigator, and selecting high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the six years of the BDGP contract.</p><p>All Rural Development Plans are subject to European Commission approval, following a detailed period of analysis, scrutiny and discussion. I can assure the Deputy that the scheme will be rolled out very shortly, with application forms issuing to all eligible farmers. This scheme is not a subsidy, but rather a developmental scheme under the Rural Development Programme. It is not permissible to arbitrarily increase the payment or, under EU or WTO rule, to provide financial incentives to encourage production, as suggested by the Deputy. </p></reply>

The nature of the Roundtable process means that the outcomes agreed must be delivered by participants on an ongoing basis and much remains to be done to ensure continued delivery of results. This work will continue.</p>  <p>  The Roundtable allows participants to engage in a positive way on strategic goals for the sector. For example, the most recent meeting of the Roundtable resulted in the establishment of a stakeholder group, led by Teagasc, which was tasked with preparing written guidelines for beef farmers which would act as a blueprint for those currently producing bull beef or considering developing bull beef production systems, taking into account production efficiency and market dynamics.</p>  <p>  The focus of the next meeting will be on Producer Organisations. General agreement exists among all stakeholders that Producer Organisations have the potential to make an enormously positive contribution to the business model of beef production in Ireland, for both farmers and processors. My Department is currently engaged in consultations to inform the debate on the optimum model for Ireland&rsquo;s beef industry.</p>  <p>  The Roundtable exists to facilitate discussion on the strategic development of the beef sector on an ongoing basis. We have seen the benefits that the forum can bring and the Roundtable forum will continue to deliver on an ongoing basis, with the positive co-operation from all of the stakeholders.</p></reply>

The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. The fact that producers will face a super-levy bill in relation to the final year of the system is obviously unwelcome. However, the rules governing the imposition of a superlevy were set by binding regulations agreed at EU level and despite numerous proposals from Ireland and other like minded countries for action at EU level to mitigate the impact of the super levy, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, it became clear as 2014 progressed and 2015 arrived that there was no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. It was not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust these super levy rules.</p>  <p>  In spite of this, I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. With respect to the impending super levy, flexibility has been secured from the European Commission for farmers to pay the superlevy fine on a phased basis over 3 years. My Department is working on the details of a scheme to give effect to this flexibility at national level.</p>  <p>  This announcement will serve as a major boost to dairy farmers in helping to ease the cashflow burden of paying the superlevy bill.</p></reply>

The aim of the Review Group is to agree standards and delivery targets for the schemes and services provided by the Department to all its clients including farmers.  In terms of the simplification, the Commissioner, Hogan, recently announced that his focus would in the first instance be on the Direct Payment Schemes.  This is an approach which I fully support and will be working closely with the Commissioner and his officials in this regard. Any simplification of schemes as a result of this initiative would of course be reflected in the Farmers Charter.</p>  <p>  Irish farmers draw down roughly &euro;1.2bn per annum in direct payments under the CAP. As you will be aware the EU Regulations governing the various schemes require Member States to carry out a certain level of inspections to ensure that farmers meet their obligations in terms of qualifying for direct payments. I am very mindful that farmer payments are crucially important and that is why there is already a robust appeals mechanism in place in my Department whereby a farmer who is not satisfied with any decision affecting his/her payment m a   y seek an internal review. Should the farmer not be satisfied with the outcome of this review he/she may refer the matter to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which is an independent agency established to provide a free impartial service to farmers who are unhappy with decisions regarding their entitlements under certain schemes. The Agriculture Appeals Office operates under the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and the Agriculture Appeals Regulations 2002.  Farmers can also appeal any decision affecting their payment entitlement to the Ombudsman. The above process including details of how to seek a review/appeal, contact details, etc. will be outlined in detail in the new Farmers Charter. </p>  <p>  While negotiations on the new Farmers&rsquo; Charter are at an advanced stage there are a number of areas that require further discussion. My Department is endeavouring to achieve consensus with representatives of the main farmer representative organisations on these outstanding issues and to do so in as timely a manner as possible. As you will be aware, a round of CAP Information meetings took place recently throughout the country. These important meetings required the involvement of key officials from my Department. As a result, progress in negotiations on the Farmers&rsquo; Charter was somewhat delayed. </p>  <p>  Upon finalisation of the new Farmers&rsquo; Charter, a Charter Monitoring Committee will be established under an independent chair to monitor Charter targets/commitments.</p></reply>

It is possible that the joint herd owners may have their own agreement in place as to the division of the entitlements between them and in those circumstances my Department will recognise and give effect to that agreement. </p>  <p>  However, in the absence of such an agreement, the presumption is that the entitlements are held by the joint herd owners in equal shares.

In other words, if a Member State decides to avail of the derogation with a view to accepting non-vaccinated pups from a particular EU Member State, it must accept non-vaccinated pups from all EU Member States, irrespective of the Member State's rabies status.

Our Seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to our economy, with exports growing by 70% since 2009 to &euro;540 million. Seafood is widely recognised as a high growth area of our economy. Through Food Harvest 2020 and this new Seafood Development Programme, I am targeting growth of the seafood industry to &euro;1 billion by 2020, with growth in employment of 3,000 to 14,000 people employed in our coastal communities. The new Seafood Development Programme will be a key element in achievement of that growth target. It will provide the capital to assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities.  The draft Seafood Development Programme proposes investment of &euro;24 million in a number of measures specifically intended to foster innovation, value adding and new product development in the seafood processing sector. These are the Seafood Capital Investment Scheme, Seafood Innovation Scheme, Seafood Scaling Scheme and Seafood Leadership Scheme. In addition, &euro;10 million investment in seafood marketing by Bord Bia is proposed.</p>  <p>  In relation to coastal communities highly dependent on fisheries, while the Programme as a whole is focussed on the economic development of the seafood sector and the coastal communities that depend on it, the draft Programme is proposing a specific investment of &euro;12 million in Fisheries Local Action Groups. FLAGs were introduced in 2013 under the previous Seafood Development Programme and 6 FLAGs covered the whole coastline. FLAG North focussed on the economic and social development of coastal areas of Donegal. In the new Programme, I am proposing to continue and build on the good work done to date under the FLAGs initiative.</p></reply>

The legislative basis for this is set out in SI 118 of 2014 which requires that all animals with a date of birth on or after 1 January 2013 must be tested for the presence of the BVD virus.</p><p>Excellent progress has been made on the programme to date with a very high percentage of herds complying with the requirement to test their calves and the incidence of PI animals falling from 0.67% in 2013 to 0.46% 2014, with a further reduction anticipated in 2015. However, there are still a relatively small number of non-participating herds and a number of farms on which persistently infected animals are being retained. </p><p>Following consultation with the BVD Implementation Group, earlier this month my Department issued restriction notices to non-participating herds, as they had failed to comply with their legal obligation to test their calves for BVD. </p><p>With regard to PI calves being retained in farms, my Department is concerned that, as the breeding season approaches, these PI animals pose a serious risk for the creation of further PI calves, both on the farms where they are being retained and on neighbouring farms. </p><p>In view of this and with a view to protecting clear herds, I intend to invoke Section 10 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which provides that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may publish the fact that an animal is affected with a disease and the location of the holding where the infected animal is kept. In this regard, my Department will be writing to herdowners in the coming weeks informing them of the risks posed to them by the presence of PI animals on the farms of neighbouring farmers who retain PI animals for more than seven weeks of the initial BVD test. These notifications will allow neighbouring farms to review their biosecurity generally and to take measures to protect their herds, including ensuring that boundaries are adequate to prevent nose to nose contact and grazing management (particularly of breeding animals) to minimize the likelihood of contact.</p><p>Although there is no legal obligation to do so, I would encourage farmers who have not yet disposed of PI calves to do so immediately. Failure to dispose of PI calves in a timely manner <i>will only prolong and add to the cost of eradication programme and put at risk the investment already made by farmers, who have invested some &euro;9m on testing each year, and by the State through its financial and other supports to the programme&quot;. </i>My Department provides financial supports to farmers to encourage them to dispose of their persistently infected (PI) animals promptly. Details of these supports are available at: .</p></reply>

My Department has a dedicated Inspection Unit to undertake these inspections. This unit interprets the governing EU regulations as they relate to inspection requirements and implements an inspection process to meet these requirements. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission and European Court of Auditors which ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements.   The inspection process has been amended over the years to reflect changes in the governing regulations and also to reflect comments and findings contained in the various audit reports.     </p>  <p>  Inspecting officers in my Department are regularly trained in inspection procedures, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification inspections to ensure a consistent approach. In addition, the Inspection Unit participates fully at various meetings and workshops organised by the European Commission on land eligibility , where Commission experts and experts from other EU member states share their knowledge. In this way the Inspection Unit has and continues to build up extensive corporate knowledge on land eligibility.

Clearly a larger programme of supports would have incentivised more productive investments. Despite that, and the particular issues faced by the sector over the period, BIM advised me that the value of the sector held steady over the period, as did the overall employment although volume of production did fall for specified reasons as set out in my reply of 10<sup>th</sup>March 2015.  I believe that significant growth can be anticipated in the coming years through increased investment. The potential for growth and job creation in the aquaculture sector has been widely recognised internationally over a number of years. The <i>Maritime Agenda for Growth and Jobs</i>(Limassol Declaration) adopted on 8 October 2012 by European Ministers for maritime policy and the European Commission placed a particular emphasis on the potential of the Blue Economy to contribute to economic recovery in the EU. The Agenda focused in particular on 5 areas of high potential, including aquaculture.  From a national perspective, <i>Food Harvest 2020</i>recognises the potential of the seafood sector, in particular aquaculture and seafood processing, to contribute to employment growth and aims to increase employment in the seafood sector from 11,000 to 14,000 by 2020. This potential is echoed in <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015</i>. </p><p>On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. I am inviting submissions on that draft Programme by 1 May 2015. The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. Those investment plans will be supported by a new National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture, which I am finalising with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and will publish for public consultation shortly. Through that National Strategic Plan and targeted investment under the Seafood Development Programme I will be seeking to identify all of the issues affecting the sustainable growth of the sector and the policy actions and supporting investment needed to address those issues. Strategic Environmental Assessments will accompany both the National Strategic Plan and Seafood Development Programme.</p></reply>

This potential is echoed in <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015</i>.</p><p>On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. I am inviting submissions on that draft Programme by 1 May 2015. The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. Those investment plans will be supported by a new National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture, which I am finalising with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and will publish for public consultation shortly. Through that National Strategic Plan and targeted investment under the Seafood Development Programme I will be seeking to identify all of the issues affecting the sustainable growth of the sector and the policy actions and supporting investment needed to address those issues. These initiatives can be expected to contribute significantly to achievement of the employment creation targets for aquaculture specified in <i>Food Harvest 2020</i>.</p></reply>

Despite extensive research, it was not possible to achieve clarity in regard to all matters surrounding the ambush.

I would also like to commend them for the selfless service that they gave to their country.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the Report, the then Minister for Defence met with the individuals referred to and, i n order   to provide appropriate public recognition of their contribution , they were both invited to a presentation ceremony held at Cathal Brugha Barracks in April 2007 during which one of the individuals accepted a presentation from the then Minister for Defence of a medallion and plaque . Furthermore, the Defence Forces held a commemorative event which was attended by the then Taoiseach in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel on 23 July 2010, to mark the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo. This event honoured all those who were deployed to serve in the Congo.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence provides annual subventions to support and encourage the two officially recognised veteran groups, the Organisation of National ex-Servicemen (ONE) and the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA).

The current position is that my officials and their counterparts in the Department of Education and Skills are working on proposals, for submission to Ministers, aimed at taking forward the policy announced in September 2014, amended as necessary to take account of a High Court decision in January of this year in respect of the language sector.  The need for reform remains clear and the problem of so called "visa factories" has to be addressed.  In that context a wide range of issues are being looked at, including reviewing the immigration permissions currently granted for the purposes of studying English.  The primary purpose of a student coming to Ireland must be that of learning.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for the replacement of the adult Wards of Court system with a less intrusive system which offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability.  Its enactment will be a key step forward in enabling Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).</p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing amendments for the D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Bill to respond to issues raised in submissions to my Department and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The aim is to strengthen the safeguards contained in this legislation so that persons with capacity difficulties can exercise decision-making autonomy to the greatest extent possible.  My intention is that we will proceed to D&aacute;il Committee Stage in the next two months.  My aim is that the Bill will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  Court funds are held in trust by the Courts. The Courts Service in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998 is responsible for the management and administration of the Courts and provides support services for the judges. It is in this capacity that the Courts Service has a role in the management and investment of court funds.</p>  <p>  For the assistance of the Deputy, I have made enquiries with the Courts Service and I am informed that the Courts Service established an Investment Committee, chaired by the President of the High Court, to oversee the management and investment of Court Funds. In addition to the President of the High Court, the Committee&rsquo;s membership comprises representatives of the judiciary from the Circuit and District courts, Courts Service officials, Court Officers including the Registrar of the Wards of Court Office, and independent external members. The Courts Service also retains independent investment advisors to advise on the management and investment of Court Funds.  The role of the investment advisors is to provide professional, independent investment advice to the Investment Committee. They also support the Courts Service and Investment Committee in the selection and appointment of fund managers and custodians. Pursuant to a EU tender, State Street Global Advisors were appointed to provide fund management services to the Courts Service.</p></reply>

I take it that these are the cases of alleged Garda malpractice to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  The review in each case consists of an examination of the papers by independent counsel, who then make a recommendation as to whether any further action might be taken.  The purpose of the review is to triage the allegations to see if further investigations are needed.  To establish a public inquiry into each of these cases at this stage would require full-scale investigations into over 300 cases, without having made any attempt to see if this was necessary or practical. </p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  However I would also make the point that, in many cases, counsel may recommend that no further action can reasonably be taken.  This might be, for example, because a case has already been through due process, such as an investigation by GSOC or a court hearing, even though the complainant remains unhappy with the outcome.  The crucial point, however, is that every case will have been reviewed by independent counsel, who will have made an objective recommendation.</p>  <p>  Although counsel have not finished their work, my Department has now received a number of recommendations from counsel, and I therefore intend to start the process shortly of notifying the persons concerned of the outcome of the review in their cases.</p></reply>

In order to fulfil these statutory obligations there are rosters in place throughout the Prison Estate to meet these requirements.  The rosters for these areas are generally on an 8am to 8pm basis with some variation depending on specific local demands.  In addition to these rosters reception areas are manned as required outside of these hours to facilitate both Committals and Discharges.</p>  <p>  The granting of temporary release is provided for in Section 1 of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act, 2003.  As provided for in this Act,  I may consider those committed for non-payment of fines for temporary release where it is my opinion that it is necessary and expedient in order to ensure the good government of the prison concerned and to maintain good order in, and humane and just management of the prison concerned.</p>  <p>  In practice, a prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by prison management and/or therapeutic services is to that effect. Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the  Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes working towards the objective of ensuring that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p></reply>

Interviewers are trained to conduct focused interviews which afford applicants the opportunity to fully explain the reasons why they fear returning to their country of origin.

This work is essential for researching the political and human rights situations in an applicant's country of origin.  </p>  <p>  In relation to trafficking specifically, caseworkers have received anti human trafficking training as part of their comprehensive training programme.  ORAC also has a referral procedure in place with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the Anti Human Trafficking Unit of my Department for investigating any possible trafficking cases.  ORAC will also request GNIB at regular periods to provide updates/results on any trafficking cases referred to them as such information may be of relevance if the investigation of an asylum application is still ongoing.  Where allegations of trafficking have been raised by an asylum applicant, these claims will be assessed by the caseworker in line with usual tests regarding the balance of probabilities for credibility and the reasonable likelihood of a well founded fear of persecution.  </p></reply>

The position remains the same.</p><p><i>At EU level, Member States, including Ireland, agreed back in 2008 that they would deal with regularisation only on a case by case basis and the Government continues to support this position.  </i></p><p><i>Ireland has shown itself to be a country that welcomes foreign nationals and this is abundantly clear from our census figures and from our citizenship ceremonies.  More than 80,000 people have been naturalised in the past 4 years. </i></p><p><i>However we are entitled to expect that people coming here will obey our laws, including those that relate to immigration.It is open to any foreign national who finds him or herself in an undocumented situation to apply to the authorities for permission to remain.  Cases are carefully considered before a decision is made and it is reasonable for the State to expect that people will respect that decision.  It should also be remembered that most people become undocumented through their own conscious actions or omissions.  Recognising that in a minority of instances that may not be the case, the Department has operated a scheme to address the situation of those who became undocumented through no fault of their own.  </i></p></reply>

These courses were run, concurrently in some cases, by <i>Gaeleagras, Gaelchult&uacute;r</i>and the Institute of Public Administration, in the Department's offices in both Dublin and Killarney.  In addition, the Department has supported members of staff who wished to do Irish courses outside of the Department, and officials who participated in an on-line written Irish course, and continues to support staff who wish to do Irish courses.  One official of the Department has gone on to do a Master's Degree in Irish while another, who had attended a number of the in-house courses, has gone on to do a B.A. Degree in Irish. </p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality has 50 members of staff on a panel of officials of the Department who are available to deal with queries in Irish from members of the public, arising principally from the courses mentioned above.</p><p>During Irish Language Week each year, for the past number of years, the Department has held an event to foster the use of the language within the Department, all of which events have been very well attended.  Finally I wish to further inform the Deputy that the Department has twice published an internal Irish magazine and each issue of the Department's quarterly newsletter has contained an article in Irish. </p></reply>

Over the four years in question, the overall grant rate for short stay visa applications was 92%, which is considered high by international standards.  It would not be appropriate to consider grant rates per individual office as the profile of types of applications processed vary quite considerably and the more complex applications are dealt with in Dublin.

The human suffering inflicted by the many acts of violence, such as the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973, is still felt to this very day and our thoughts are with the victims of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles and their families.</p>  <p>  The late Mr. Justice Henry Barron carried out a detailed and painstaking independent inquiry into the awful events to which the Deputy refers and, indeed, other atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  Related matters were also investigated by a Commission of Investigation carried out by Mr. Patrick McEntee SC.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, an extensive Garda investigation was carried out at the time of these bombings involving liaison with police forces in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and with the support of the Defence Forces.  Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to bring any persons to justice for these crimes.  That said the Garda investigations into these and other, similar crimes remain open and if any new or additional evidence becomes available it will be pursued fully.</p>  <p>  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the subsequent report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner in 2005 appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then.  It is currently provided by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.</p>  <p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families, such as those crimes related to the Troubles, is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account the specific requirements of the individuals themselves.</p></reply>

The General Scheme includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  When enacted, the Bill will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of a number of EU, UN and Council of Europe legal instruments.  The Bill will also implement the recommendations of a number of Oireachtas committees, reform the law on incest and update the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  In addition, the Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.</p>  <p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that it is necessary to take these steps to tackle the trafficking and wider exploitation of persons through prostitution.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill is a complex piece of legislation which addresses a number of sensitive issues.  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and / or a fine.</p></reply>

In that regard I, along with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, published a policy document in September 2014 for the operation of such schools.  As outlined in my response to PQ No 323 for today revised proposals are being worked on for submission to Ministers, aimed at taking forward the policy announced in September 2014, amended as necessary to take account of a High Court decision in January of this year in respect of the language sector.</p><p>The aim is to have in place an appropriate immigration regime to deal with applications from non-EEA students seeking permission to come to Ireland for the purpose of attending English language programmes.  That includes ensuring that students are fulfilling the conditions of their permission, that the college is operating in a manner that can justify the granting of immigration permission to such students and that the immigration regime is consistent with public policy generally.</p><p>Part of the monitoring and enforcement of this regime is to carry out inspections and in that regard, I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the number of inspections that were carried out by its personnel on colleges that offer language courses, either exclusively or in addition to other programmes, is as follows<table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Inspections</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>2010</b></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td><b>2011</b></td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td><b>2012</b></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td><b>2013</b></td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td><b>2014</b></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><b>2015 to date</b></td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p>The table above does not include any inspections undertaken separately by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. The level of inspections reduced somewhat in 2014 as the priority was to deal with the fallout of the closures of a number of providers and the consequences for the students.  However arrangements have now been put in place that will lead to a substantial increase in inspections in 2015, in conjunction with revised reform proposals that are at an advanced stage.</p><p>A total of 14 colleges were suspended on a temporary (i.e. reinstated after certain issues were addressed), partial (in respect of certain programmes) or fully on foot of these inspections, of which it is understood that 10 have ceased trading.</p><p>No statistics are maintained on the number of student permissions revoked on account of failure to attend classes.

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.</p>  <p>  In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, the Minister must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</p>  <p>  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>  <p>  The matter of effecting removals from the State is a very complex area and there are many reasons why Deportation Orders may not be enforced. Among these reasons are Judicial Review proceedings taken in the lead up to and often  immediately prior to deportation, or that the persons concerned have children who are still in the asylum/protection process or issues procuring travel documents for certain countries.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that comprehensive statistics in relation to deportations and removals from the State for the years in question are in the process of being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</p></reply>

However, following a comprehensive and detailed examination of representations submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) a decision is made as to whether or not to make a Deportation Order in each case. If a decision is made not to make a Deportation Order, a grant of permission to remain will subsequently ensue.  The numbers of grants is provided in the following table.</p><p>It should be noted that considerations under Section 3 of the Act arise from a wide range of situations including, for example,  from persons who have been unsuccessful in the protection process and also from persons who have not been granted a permission to be in the State either having been here illegally or who had a permission that had not been renewed.  The volume of cases on hand is difficult to estimate and any figures involved can be somewhat misleading. For example in the case of families, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department will usually process the entire family together. However, Section 3 considerations for some family members can be held up due to individual family members being a different stages of the process, often because one family member has decided to take a judicial review of an earlier decision or because the applicants have made asylum applications for various family members sequentially.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Persons granted leave to remain after consideration of their cases under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No</th></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>216</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>226</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>731</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1,052</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>512</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>232</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1,074</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>489</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>763</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>768</td></tr></table></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></p></reply>

Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 Report. The Group drew attention to the requirement that payment must be made in such cases as part of the transaction, e.g. on-line shopping, and not later on delivery of the product. The Group noted that sales of intoxicating liquor which had been ordered by telephone or otherwise and which were paid for on delivery were illegal transactions and recommended that the Garda&iacute; should target such delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the Licensing Acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Moreover, under section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol to any person for consumption off his or her premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</p>  <p>  The Government Legislation Programme provides for future publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill. The Bill, which will update the Licensing Acts and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions, will provide an opportunity to further consider the difficulties arising in relation to the control of distance sales of intoxicating liquor and the enforcement of such controls.</p></reply>

The specific deployment of policing resources is a matter for the Garda authorities, as is the question on ongoing engagement and meetings with transport operators.</p><p>I am of course aware of the recent very serious incident at a Luas stop in Dublin.  As the matter is the subject of a Garda investigation the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further about it at this time.</p><p>In so far as the general approach to tackling these issues are concerned, I am advised that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators in the Dublin area and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place as required to address issues that have arisen at specific locations.  Instances of crime and anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.</p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that a comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.  There is a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also have specific powers of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</p><p>With regard to the crime statistics requested by the Deputy, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</p><p>I have requested the CSO to provide the available statistics directly to the Deputy. In this regard it should be noted that the CSO is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>The CSO have advised that this has led to a delay in the publication of crime statistics and the latest published crime statistics relate to the second quarter of 2014.</p></reply>

The adult may give the attorney the authority to make personal welfare decisions which include decisions as to who the person may or may not see.  If a carer has not been appointed as an attorney under an enduring power with such authority, the carer cannot deny access to the person with dementia.  Section 12(4) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 gives the court, on application to it by an interested party, the power to cancel the registration of an enduring power of attorney for any good and sufficient reason.</p>  <p>  The legislation on enduring powers of attorney is being reformed in the context of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013. The Bill will require attorneys to abide by the guiding principles of the Bill which ensure that the will and preferences of the person with capacity difficulties are given due consideration.  The Bill will also require attorneys to be subject to supervision by the Office of the Public Guardian which will have the role of registering enduring powers of attorney.

Each application is subject to a financial eligibility test where an applicant must have a disposable income, after certain allowances, of less than &euro;18,000 and disposable capital of less that &euro;100,000. The applicant is required to pay a contribution based on their financial circumstances. In addition each application is subject to a merits test under the terms of Section 28 (2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  Applications for repossession must satisfy this merits test and each case is considered by the Board based on its own particular circumstances. There is also an appeals process. Section 28(2) is comprehensive in its scope and the provisions are in my view reasonable and proportionate.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board provides services from the resources available to it from funding from the Department of Justice and Equality, client contributions and costs recovered.  The Board operates a waiting list for applicants for legal aid and priority is given to certain categories of cases and in certain circumstances. Repossession cases do not fall within the category of cases where priority is automatically granted however I am informed that Managing Solicitors may grant priority to a case outside of these categories where it is deemed necessary.</p>  <p>  Any person who satisfies the means test can seek advice in relation to a repossession problem. Applicants are given legal advice at their consultation with a solicitor; this includes all matters relevant to the particular circumstances of the case. To date in 2015, there are 37 active repossession applications with the Board that have had a first consultation with a solicitor. There were 17 applications for legal aid certificates for repossession in 2014. Of those, 6 were granted legal representation and 11 were refused as they did not satisfy the merits test.</p></reply>

That information is now to hand.</p>  <p>  The figures provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Periodic Report to which the Deputy referred in her previous questions related to the specific matter of investigations carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into allegations of extraordinary rendition being carried out at Shannon Airport.  My reply to Parliamentary Question No. 417 of 14 January 2015 provided figures in respect of requests made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out searches of aircraft.  I am advised by the Garda Authorities that for the purposes of record keeping, a distinction is made between the issue of extraordinary rendition and the more general matter of requests to carry out searches.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains fully committed to investigate all alleged breaches of criminal law involving the use of aircraft at Shannon Airport.  Statutory powers of search and entry are bestowed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under various legislative provisions and when authorised by a Judge.  However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a reasonable suspicion that an offence has occurred supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity.</p></reply>

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on District, Divisional and Regional levels to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p><p>Following the recommencement of Garda recruitment the Garda Commissioner will soon be in a position to assign newly attested Gardai to stations throughout the country. Since September 2014, 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College and the first 100 of these will attest as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in May, with 100 more due to attest in August 2015. The Government is committed to ensuring that recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues seamlessly and this commitment is underlined by the provision which has been made for an additional  250 recruits to commence training in Templemore in the current year.</p><p>With regard to the crime statistics requested by the Deputy, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</p><p>I have requested the CSO to provide the available statistics directly to the Deputy. In this regard it should be noted that the CSO is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of certain issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate in relation to the recording, classification and reclassification of crime, to see whether and to what extent they may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<i>.</i>The CSO have advised that this has led to a delay in the publication of crime statistics and the latest published crime statistics relate to the second quarter of 2014.</p></reply>

This suspect offender was granted his first licence in 1997 and at that time and for subsequent licence renewals he was not found to be a person disentitled to hold a firearms certificate.  This means in summary that he was not found at the time of licence issue and renewal to be a person of intemperate habits or unsound mind or a person sentenced to imprisonment for an offence under the Firearms Acts or the Offences Against the State Act  under Section 8 of the Firearms Act 1925, as amended.Section 8  also applies to a person bound by a recognisance to keep the peace with a condition not to possess any firearm, and to a person not ordinarily resident in the State.</p></reply>

Its role, and mine as Minister, in this area is to put in place an appropriate immigration regime to deal with applications from non-EEA students seeking permission to come to Ireland for the purpose of attending English language programmes.  That includes ensuring that students are fulfilling the conditions of their permission, that the college is operating in a manner that can justify the granting of immigration permission to such students and that the immigration regime is consistent with public policy generally. For longer courses (where the student stays longer than 90 days) that requires the maintenance of a list of programmes for which immigration permission may be given provided that the student meets the immigration requirements.  This has previously been what is referred to as the Internationalisation Register (it also lists academic programmes).

The investigation also involved close liaison with the authorities in Northern Ireland in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice.  Although every avenue of inquiry which was open to the investigation was pursued at that time there was no evidence to bring those responsible to justice.</p>  <p>  I am  informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation into these murders remains open and should any new or additional evidence emerge from any source, it will be actively pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Barron Commission of Inquiry in the second of its reports inquired into the Belturbet bombing, amongst a number of other atrocities which were carried out in the early 1970s.  My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged fully with the Barron Inquiry and made their files in relation to this and other incidents available to that Inquiry.</p>  <p>  While the Deputy will understand that I have no role in respect of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman's Office,  I fully understand the families' efforts in continuing to seek justice for their loved ones.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is difficult.  The Stormont House Agreement sets out a series of useful measures to put in place an overarching framework to deal with the past.  The Government is fully committed to playing its part in implementing those measures and I hope they may provide an opportunity for the families of persons killed during the troubles to access further information.</p></reply>

In line with the 2013 policy, the fostering allowance follows the child and is therefore deducted from the main carer and paid to the foster carers providing the respite care.  In circumstances where respite from home is being provided by foster carers an allowance will be paid to them from Tusla's fostering budget.</p>  <p>  Fostering care allowances are provided in order to allow foster carers meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs, e.g. food, clothing, school uniform, school books, extra-curricular activities, school trips, pocket money (depending on the age of the child), and treats such as toys, games or holidays. The Tusla Alternative Care Practice Handbook notes that the allowance  "is not a wage or salary for the carers".  The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child up to 12 years of age, and   &euro;352 per week per child over 12 years of age. The foster care allowance is tax exempt.</p>  <p>  Respite care is defined in the National Standards for Foster Care as &lsquo;short term care provided to a child in order to support the child, his or her parent(s) or foster carers by providing a break for the child and his or her primary caregivers&rsquo;.  It is acknowledged that respite care can play an invaluable role in supporting children to remain at home, and during placement breakdown.  Where a child is in care, the issue of respite periods would be considered in the context of the best interests of the child.  Respite care would not feature in all placements, and would normally be included as part of the child's care plan if it is to be availed of during the placement.  Where planned respite care is for a period of less than a week, then a pro-rata payment is made based on the foster care allowance for a full week. </p></reply>

While each individual case may present its own challenges, such as addressing sometimes significant gaps in education that have arisen, I understand that the participation rates in education for children in care are on a par with those seen in the wider community.   It is clear that the partnership approach between Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills is ensuring that children in care have access to and do access education.</p></reply>

In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.</i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities. In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. </p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities. It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design. </p><p>My Department has now commenced a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations. The consultation includes regional meetings in Cork, Sligo and Dublin City and County over the next month. All local services are being invited to participate, including youth projects funded under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and the coordinators of the Drugs Task Forces in the relevant areas.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the youth sector interests in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.</p><p>I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion. The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people who are at risk  of experiencing the poorest outcomes. </p></reply>

This funding, which is in the region of &euro;260 million annually, supports a number of childcare programmes and benefits more than 100,000 children each year. </p>  <p>  These programmes, which are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, includes the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme. This programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.    In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work-force or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children before commencing primary school.  This programme represents an annual investment of more than &euro;170 million in pre-school services.  In the region of 67,000 children benefit each year from this free pre-school provision.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current provision.  I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in childcare-related programmes. This will take time, as the benefits of growth generate the required resources.  However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence and strategically co-ordinated, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children and parents. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children. The Group, which is still in the early stages of its deliberations, will submit its final report to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

There are specialist sexual abuse centres at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital. Therapy services are also provided by HSE community based psychologists and the HSE Child And Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) for children who have moderate to severe mental health problems. </p><p>In addition, the Assessment, Consultation &amp;amp; Therapy Service<b>(</b>ACTS) is a national specialised clinical service which has been developed in order to provide multi-disciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs. ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes:-<blockquote>-  on-site therapeutic services to young people in secure settings in Ireland (Special Care and the Children Detention Schools)<br /><br />-  support when young people return to community settings to help them to re-engage with mainstream services as appropriate<br /><br />-  assessment, consultation and/or intervention services in the community for children at significant risk of placement in secure settings.</blockquote>Tusla is currently leading a multi-agency process to implement a national service model for sexual abuse services for children and their families.  This process aims to incorporate all resources currently applied to sexual abuse services into a co-ordinated service providing standardised models of best practice with national and multi-agency oversight.  It integrates and co-ordinates the six separate sexual abuse services which children may need to access. These services include medical/forensic examination; child protection; Garda investigation; assessment; therapy and court process. </p><p>The agencies involved in this process are Tusla, the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, the Probation Service and CARI. The model is informed by the recommendations of the Ferns Report 2005 and the National Review of Sexual Abuse Services for Children and Young People, June 2011 (HSE/Mott McDonald). </p><p>All agencies are committed to the implementation of the model with a number of initiatives currently underway.  For example, the HSE is establishing a new medical/forensic examination facility for the greater Dublin area; specialist sexual abuse services are being developed within the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and Tusla is employing four additional staff at Principal Social Worker grade to support the implementation process.</p></reply>

These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 67,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.  In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  The After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children. The Group, which is still in the early stages of its deliberations, will submit its final report to Government in June 2015.</p>  <p>  The decision to locate childcare facilities within a workplace is a matter for agreement between employer and employees and there are currently no plans by my Department to provide any specific support for such measures.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.</p>  <p>  My Department has notified youth organisations and projects of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services.  As in recent years, national organisations along with the grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, were invited where it was appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.  A small number of requests for reconfiguration have been received by my Department in 2015.  </p>  <p>  My Department maintains close contact with the youth services throughout the country, and works closely with Education and Training boards in this regard. Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards engage with local services, on behalf of my Department. They provide support and advice in matters to do with the application and reporting processes for funding and the implementation of quality standards in services for young people. </p>  <p>  I and my Department regularly receive representations from youth services on a range of issues, including financial provision. I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups. In January and February, officials of my Department met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to discuss recent and upcoming developments and to hear their plans for the services in 2015. My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. </p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new National Youth Strategy.  Based on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020, it will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy is being developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people. A National Youth Strategy Task Group, convened by my Department, is overseeing its development. This Task Group comprises representatives of Government Departments, relevant agencies, business, academia and youth interests. A comprehensive consultation with youth stakeholders and young people on the priorities for the youth strategy has recently concluded. My Department is working to finalise the new National Youth Strategy by early Summer. </p></reply>

We know from the Growing Up in Ireland survey that is commissioned by my Department that a total of 40% of nine-year-olds reported being victims of bullying in the past year, and boys and girls experienced similar rates of victimisation. Prevalence rates based on information provided by the child&rsquo;s mother were substantially lower than rates based on children&rsquo;s reports, with 23% of the mothers of nine year- olds reporting that their child had been victimised in the previous year. Many mothers were unaware of their children&rsquo;s experiences of bullying. For the children who did report victimisation in the previous year, only 39% of their mothers appeared to have been aware that their child had been the victim of bullying.</p>  <p>  Experiences of victimisation were upsetting to the majority of children. Almost 90% of children reported that the bullying had caused them upset. Girls were more likely than boys to report feeling very upset as a result of the bullying. </p>  <p>  Some 13% of children reported having bullied another in the previous year. Similar proportions of boys and girls reported bullying another. Children who had been  bullied most commonly engaged in bullying through exclusion, followed by verbal bullying and physical bullying.  Boys were more likely to engage in physical and verbal bullying, while girls were more likely to engage in bullying through exclusion.  These patterns also clearly reflect what children reported in terms of victimisation.</p>  <p>  The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Ireland Report 2010 has found that over 24% of 10 to 17 year olds have reported being bullied.  These figures will be updated in September when the next HBSC survey, which is conducted every four years, is published.</p>  <p>  In seeking to address the problem of bullying we must tackle the underlying and root causes of bullying in a sustained manner, focusing on tackling prejudice, including homophobia, where it exists in our schools and wider society today.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, provides the framework for the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensure a safer childhood.</p></reply>

These include figures showing the number of referrals which are disaggregated by welfare concerns and abuse concerns. The most recent validated figures for referrals to hand are up to the third quarter of 2014.  Tusla has stated that, subject to validation, the total of referrals for 2014 shows that there were 43,126 reports of child protection and welfare concerns received by Tusla.  </p>  <p>  Not all referrals will result in a need for a social work service or in a child being received into care and approximately 50% can be expected to proceed from preliminary enquiry to the initial assessment stage. The most recent figures for welfare concerns and abuse concerns at the end of third quarter of 2014, showed 14,112 abuse concern referrals and 18,575 welfare concern referrals (to the end of September 2014).  The referrals of a child abuse concern were reported as:  Physical (19%), Emotional (34%), Sexual (17%) and Neglect (30%).  Of these referrals, 55% of abuse concerns and 42% of welfare concerns went forward to the initial assessment stage.  Tusla reported that of the referrals received in the third quarter of 2014, 94% of referrals received a preliminary enquiry and 49% of initial assessments were completed by the end of the quarter.  Assesments can be complex and dynamic, and some consideration needs to be given to the end of quarter figures so that they adequately reflect the work that has been achieved in each case.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has provided my Department with monthly figures of the number of children in care for all of 2014.  At the close of 2014, the number of children in care was reported as 6,463 children, of whom 93% were in a foster care setting.  The number of children in care represents 23% of the total of 27,651 open cases reported by Tusla at the end of the year.  Of the total number of open cases at the end of 2014, 19,300 had an allocated social worker and 8,351 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  The number of cases waiting to be allocated a social worker is an issue that is being addressed by Tusla.  This figure has reduced by over 14% over the full year of 2014.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has responsibilities to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, with regard to the principle that, where possible, it is in the best interests of the child to be brought up in their own family.  Tusla does not have statutory responsibilities for services which may be availed of by children and families in the normal course of events.  Responsibility for policy in relation to the treatment and support for young people with mental health problems, and those requiring medical care as a result of self-harm, rests with the Department of Health.  In relation to homelessness, I informed the House earlier today on how Tusla is engaging on the issue.  The statutory responsibility for the accommodation needs where the family is homeless, and the children are in the care of their parents, is with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.</p>  <p>  Where there are reasonable grounds for concern for a child's welfare and protection, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, should always be informed.  This has been Tusla's responsibility since its establishment in January 2014.  My Department receives regular reports on the number of referrals and the outcomes that result.  In addition to the rigorous governance arrangements with Tusla, my Department also reviews the findings of a number of independent bodies, including the Health Information and Quality Authority inspection reports, reports on child deaths and serious incidents from the independently chaired National Review Panel and also reports from the Ombudsman for Children.  My Department also maintains contact with the non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, and the Irish Foster Care Association.  This is in addition to the day to day monitoring of children who may be at risk or children in care that is carried out by Tusla as part of its responsibilities under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.</p></reply>

Dublin, currently provide a total of 54 detention places for children ordered to be remanded or committed by the courts, with 48 places for boys and 6 places for girls.  </p>  <p>  The detention schools cater for boys up to the age of 17 years who are serving a sentence, boys up to the age of 18 years who are remanded in custody and all girls up to the age of 18 years.  In line with the Programme for Government commitment to end the detention of children in the adult prison facilities, boys aged 17 newly remanded in custody are being accommodated in the children detention schools since 30 March 2015, where places are available.  Boys aged 17 ordered to serve a sentence of detention are currently accommodated in the adult prison system.  This practice will cease later in 2015 on completion of the capital project in Oberstown and the enactment of a Bill to amend the Children Act 2001, which is to be considered by Government for publication shortly.  In addition to expanding the capacity of the Oberstown site, the project will also deliver associated education, recreation, visiting , medical and other ancillary facilities. </p>  <p>  An individual management plan is put in place for each child on admission to the children detention schools which includes a mental health assessment to determine the need for more specialist services provided by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service.  This is a national service provided jointly by Tusla - the Child and Family Agency and the children detention schools which provides clinical services to children in detention and also in special care facilities, as well as short term interventions when the child returns to the community.  </p>  <p>  Appropriate education, training and other programmes and facilities for children are provided by the children detention schools on the Oberstown campus in line with the principles of the Children Act 2001, in conjunction with the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The delivery of children detention services is focused on education and rehabilitation of those young people detained in order to address offending behaviour and support their early re-integration into the community.</p></reply>

It aims to break &ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo; in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  As and from 2015, all approved sites are under contract and operational.</p>  <p>  The ABC Project Team was set up to oversee the implementation of the ABC Programme.  The Project Team is chaired by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and includes representatives from seven other Government Departments, its co-funders The Atlantic Philanthropies, Health Service Executive, Tusla Child and Family Agency as well as the two managing agencies of the Programme, Pobal and the Centre for Effective Services (CES).  </p>  <p>  CES is responsible for designing and managing the evaluation of the ABC Programme. It is guided and supported in the planning and implementation of the evaluation by the Expert Advisory Group (EAG). The overall approach to the evaluation has been agreed with the Expert Advisory Group.   The evaluation of the ABC Programme will adopt a shared measurement framework, identifying common measures to be collected across all ABC sites on core outcomes and implementation processes.</p>  <p>  An Interim report synthesising and summarising the aggregated learning from the ABC programme evaluation will be produced mid-2016 and the final evaluation report will be produced in 2018. </p>  <p>  An ABC Evaluation Group has been established with representatives from each of the ABC Areas, which will provide ongoing support and advice to CES on the evaluation of the programme with regard to Area and organisational contexts, resources and capacities. This Evaluation Group will aid in identifying evaluation issues and potential practical solutions to these.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.  My Department has notified youth organisations and projects, including Kildare Youth Service, of their 2015 allocations in respect of their youth services. An allocation of &euro;488,200 has been allocated for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland.</p>  <p>  As in recent years, national organisations along with the grant administering agencies that administer youth funding, on behalf of my Department, were invited where it was appropriate, to submit proposals to my Department for the reconfiguration of the funding allocations notified to them across projects and funding schemes to better meet local needs.  No submission was received in respect of proposals for the youth services in County Kildare. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the challenges that the budgetary constraints raise for the youth services throughout the country.  Last year, officials of my Department met Kildare Youth Services and have visited their office in Naas to hear about their work and their proposals, for the provision of services in County Kildare.  My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.  In addition, Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare Town has received approval under the 2013 Capital Scheme for the development of a new youth caf&eacute; facility.  Officials of my Department continue to be available to meet with youth services to discuss any issues that arise for them in the provision of local services within the budgets available.</p></reply>

However it is important to persist with registration and inspection of these facilities to drive reform and improvements in the care and supports provided to people with a disability who are supported by the State. The Health Information and Quality Authority's findings serve as evidence that the regulatory process is necessary and in the interest of protecting vulnerable people in residential services.

For the National Ambulance Service (NAS), this could, for example, involve the provision of an emergency first response (EFR) to an incident where an ambulance is not nearby or immediately available, specialist assistance at a road traffic accident, or assisting in the removal of patients to an ambulance where this presents difficulties for the ambulance crew.  In a number of areas, there are already local arrangements between the NAS and fire services to provide EFR assistance for 112/999 calls, in particular for cardiac incidents.   </p>  <p>  As I have already publicly stated, I am very supportive of this initiative and would like to see development of emergency first responder capability across all our emergency services.  To this end, I would like to see EFR capacity extended across our fire services.  Fire services are well placed geographically and this would be an excellent enhancement of existing capacity and resources in communities across Ireland.  As well, it would very neatly complement the voluntary network of community first response teams which is already in place. </p>  <p>  Given the scope for such development, its potential value for getting initial treatment to people as quickly as possible and the obvious patient benefit, I would very much like to see consideration at national level, between the NAS and fire services, as to how best to approach this issue, particularly in terms of operational interaction and clinical governance.  This is being done for community first response and that may be a good model for fire services emergency response.  I would be happy to facilitate such discussions, along with my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition. 20 cases of of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014. This number is likely to fall following validation.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations. Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation. Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques). Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland. In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient. If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities. This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test. Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.</p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee. The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. These strategies will be published in a Final Report. In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought. The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>  -  To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>  -  To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;</p>  <p>  -  To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;</p>  <p>  -  To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>  -  To develop straegies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>  -  To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting on May 6.</p>  <p>  Each year the HPSC holds a Lyme Awareness Week.  This involves raising awareness for clinicians and the general public as to the risks of infected biting ticks, protection against tick bites and identifying the disease.  Much use is made of the media to broadcast these messages in addition to the extensive material provided on the HPSC website.  This years Lyme Awareness Week takes place from April 27- May.</p></reply>

Given the limited number of surgeons who specialise in renal transplantation, any vacancies pose a challenge. While every effort is being made to fill the vacancies, adequate surgeons are available to provide transplant services. All available kidneys suitable for transplantation have been utilised and no kidneys have been exported.</p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is collaborating with other transplant services in relation to the development of an intra-abdominal organ retrieval service as well as a combined approach to kidney/pancreas transplants.</p>  <p>  The deceased donor transplant programme is largely dependent on the generosity of families at a time of immense grief. While donor numbers were lower in 2014 than the previous year, numbers are subject to fluctuation year on year.  Additional funding of almost &euro;3m has been provided to the HSE&rsquo;s Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland to facilitate the development of the most appropriate infrastructure to support organ donation and transplantation. The extra investment includes provision for the appointment of 19 whole-time-equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation across the country. These staff will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation and to optimise conversion rates. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the measures being put in place will lead to an increase in organ donation and successful transplants, thereby reducing waiting times for patients on the transplant waiting list and also the need for dialysis in these cases.</p></reply>

This approach will include the development by my Department of a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning during 2015. A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future. The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population ageing and any relevant considerations arising from the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme currently underway. Consultation with key stakeholders will form part of the Group's work. </p><p>In relation to the recruitment and retention of nurses in the nursing home sector, two areas are currently under active review. </p><p>Firstly, with regard to the recruitment of nurses educated and trained in Ireland, the Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director has facilitated the nursing home sector to meet with graduate students in higher education institutions. In addition, the Chief Nursing Office in my Department has engaged with the nursing home sector in promoting nursing of the older person as a career choice. The Office has facilitated discussions, spoken at conferences and engaged with higher education institutions in seeking solutions. Discussions have involved exploring career pathways within older people services to encourage staff into this area of nursing practice. </p><p>Secondly, with regard to the international recruitment of nurses, three adaptation courses are available in April, June and August 2015 respectively. These courses are 6 weeks in duration and facilitate the integration of nurses to nursing in an Irish context. Of the 195 places available, only 60 places have been taken to date. The nursing home sector is aware of these vacancies. Options are also being explored regarding a one-day programme of assessment through an examination format. A pilot of this programme is planned for 2015.</p></reply>

Programmes that aim to reduce suicidal behaviour among young people might work for some students but may have an adverse effect on others.  A large number of suicide awareness programmes have been developed internationally for use in school settings to address the problem of suicidal behaviour within this cohort.  However, there is inconclusive evidence of the efficacy of these programmes and, in the absence of such conclusive evidence, many countries have recommended that schools avoid suicide awareness projects with students.  This view has also been incorporated into the <i>Department of Education and Skills Well-Being in Post Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.</i>The Guidelines recommend that the safeTALK suicide awareness programme should be targeted at school staff and should not be delivered to students.</p><p>Research findings suggest that effective mental health promotion programmes in schools can produce long-term benefits for young people.  This is achieved by putting systems and policies in place to make the school a safe and supportive environment.  </p><p>The research evidence also suggests that the aims of suicide prevention in school-aged groups is best met by engaging in programmes which serve to enhance the factors which protect against suicide (e.g. problem solving, good coping skills, communication skills, self-esteem etc) and reduce the risk factors associated with suicide (e.g. depression, anxiety, poor social networks, low self-esteem etc).  The work of schools should be around building resilience so that young people have the skills to deal with adversity when they encounter it.  The Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum taught in post-primary schools has become a vital way to achieve this.  Emotional health is set within the context of the SPHE programme.  </p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are currently finalising a new National Strategic Framework to Reduce Suicide for the period 2015 &ndash; 2020.  The Framework, which is expected to be completed shortly, will seek to broaden the response to suicide risk across the health sector, agencies and Government departments.  In this regard the Department of Health and the National Office for Suicide Prevention are working closely with the Department of Education and Skills to identify actions and outcomes around suicide prevention for the school sector, to be included in the new Framework.</p><p>Having regard to the above, I do not intend to provide funding for suicide prevention courses in post primary schools.  </p></reply>

The service provider is responsible for compliance with Regulation 8 of the (Care and Support of Resident in Designated Centres for Persons with Disabilities) Regulations 2013 and to comply with the National Policy and Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse.  When HIQA receives information in relation to reports of allegations of abuse, the information is used to inform its regulatory engagement with the designated centre.  HIQA's processes ensure that there is a response to all information received and that it is risk assessed.  Where the information is of a serious nature, HIQA can trigger an inspection of that centre, regardless of any outcome from enquires undertaken by the provider. </p>  <p>  If HIQA become aware of an allegation of abuse, the service provider is required to demonstrate that they have responded appropriately to the allegation in a manner that prioritises the safety of residents as clearly outlined within their National Policy and the relevant regulations.  If the  providers response to allegations is assessed as inadequate, providers are required to take further action to prioritise the safety of residents.  Further regulatory action may be taken such as requiring the provider to take specific actions within a specific timeframe, adding a condition to the registration of a centre, cancelling the registration of a centre, or taking a prosecution.  HIQA welcomes feedback and views such feedback as an opportunity to improve the quality of its work.</p></reply>

This MOU has underpinned cooperation between the two bodies since then.</p>  <p>  HIQA recognises the Mental Health Commission's role in helping to drive improvements to the quality and safety of social care services that are provided for people being cared for in the mental health services.  In fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, since September 2013 HIQA has used the MOU to ensure that its work is consistent with its statutory remit and with the terms of the MOU.</p>  <p>  HIQA has also used the MOU to inform its regulatory work when that work relates to care settings for which the Mental Health Commission also has a regulatory duty.  This results in a complementary approach which ultimately serves the best interests of people who use social care services.  HIQA has a strong and positive working relationship with the Mental Health Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  On 25-26 September, 2014, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission jointly hosted a two-day conference of EPSO (European Platform for Supervisory Organisations) in Dublin.  This conference facilitated exchange of international information about the use of information in regulation, risk management, indicators of health system coverage and mental health services during economic crisis, and methodological frameworks and models for supervisory organisations.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission also interact through the work of Ireland's Health and Social Care Regulatory Forum.</p>  <p>  The most recent meeting of the two organisations was convened on 2nd February and was attended by both CEOs.  </p></reply>

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. </p>  <p>  The introduction of LCR is one of a suite of measures which I announced in November 2014 to address the rising health insurance premiums and stabilise the private health insurance market in the interests of consumers.  Other measures introduced include a reduction in stamp duty, a reduction in the Health Insurance Authority levy and the introduction of 'Young Adult' rates of premium from 1 May 2015, based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26.  Young adult rates will ensure the phasing-in of full adult rates and ease the effect of the dramatic price increase experienced when student rates no longer apply.  The package of measures I announced in November also includes key recommendations set out in the two Pat McLoughlin reports on Private Health Insurance costs and builds on Budget 2015 which included a freeze on hospital bed charges and no decrease in the relievable amount for tax relief purposes.  Taken together, these measures are intended to help control premium inflation and to create a sustainable market where health insurance is affordable for as many people as possible.</p>  <p>  There are a broad range of plans available in the health insurance market, providing varying levels of cover from basic to comprehensive level.  This facilitates consumer choice when purchasing health insurance and consumers should actively seek out plans which offer the most suitable level of cover, and which provide the greatest value for money, for their individual needs.  I would encourage individuals to carefully review their private health insurance requirements when taking out, or renewing, a health insurance contract.  Many customers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover required to meet their needs.  The Health Insurance Authority provides information to consumers in this regard and may be contacted at Lo-call 1850 929166 or at www.hia.ie. </p></reply>

This type of service can be provided by a range of trained health professionals and delivered to meet a clinical need at either primary or secondary care level.</p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service is a national service funded from the Programme for Government investment in Mental Health, to increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and supplementing existing services provided by Primary Care.  Since 2012, &euro;7.5 million has been provided to develop the CIPC service.  The service provides short term counselling for adults with non-complex psychological problems aged 18 years and over and who hold a valid medical card.  Every effort is made to see people as quickly as possible, however there are a number of people waiting extended periods many of whom will have specific requirements, for example can only attend on a specific day or time or may wish to be seen in a particular area.  In some areas, there is a particular difficulty accessing accommodation in which to see clients, which in turn impacts on waiting times.  This is an issue in some of the smaller rural areas and one that the HSE is working to resolve.</p>  <p>  Within the specialist secondary care mental health service counselling and psychotherapy is provided within community mental health teams when service users are clinically assessed as requiring this intervention and is provided by a health professional on the team.  Counselling is also provided by a range of voluntary organisations across the health service and HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention funds voluntary organisations such as Pieta House and Console to provide support across a range of needs.</p>  <p>  The provision of a quality counselling service across both primary and secondary care will be developed further, as resources permit.  In the first instance however, the HSE Mental Health Division must ensure that the funding currently allocated to CIPC is being used to best effect, to deliver the best outcomes.

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008. Notwithstanding that the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill consultant, NCHD and nursing posts.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels. The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued. Pending this sanction, the existing moratorium and ECF arrangements will continue to apply. However the number of nurses employed has already increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months. This increase encompasses initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts.</p></reply>

There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.  In addition, the HSE cannot exceed or plan to exceed its approved commitment thresholds.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet residential need now and in the future.</p>  <p>  It would not be within the remit of my Department to consider whether VAT should be reimbursed for any purposes.</p></reply>

In many instances respite services are part of the overall suite of services provided by voluntary service providers to people with disabilities under their service level agreements with the HSE. The HSE remains committed to working with all voluntary disability service providers to ensure that all of the resources available for specialist disability services, including respite services, are used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Operational Plan for 2015 aims to provide 190,000 overnight stays in centre-based respite services to almost 5,300 people. The HSE is also committed to continuing to explore methods of community respite care as an alternative to centre-based respite care, including advancing the Host Family Support Model.</p>  <p>  Agencies which provide centre-based respite care are subject to inspection by HIQA under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Support of Residents in Designated Centres for Persons (Children And Adults) With Disabilities) Regulations 2013, Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Persons (Children and Adults) with Disabilities) Regulations 2013 and the National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Compliance with HIQA standards is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements (SLA) between the HSE and voluntary service providers in the disability sector, including providers of respite services. The introduction of registration and inspection represents a significant advance in terms of delivering consistent and high quality services for people with disabilities in centre-based respite services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues, they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply. If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the HSE.</p></reply>

Additional funding totalling &euro;125 million has been provided primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children and to enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and forensic mental health services.</p><p>This sustained investment in mental health since 2012 has resulted in over 1,150 new staff for the sector.  As at the end of January 2015, of the 416 approved posts in 2012, approximately 96% (401.5) are now filled.  Of the 477 posts approved in 2013, 84% (403) are filled.  The remainder of the vacant posts are at various stages of recruitment, with some difficulties in identifying some outstanding candidates, primarily for geographic and qualification reasons.  The recruitment of the 251 approved posts for 2014 has commenced, with 25% filled (64) and a further 58 at various stages of the recruitment process.</p><p>A great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities, better suited to modern mental health care.  Progress also includes the establishment of the HSE Mental Health Division which delivers on a key recommendation of <i>Vision</i>, the development of child and adolescent services, shorter episodes of in-patient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.</p><p>Implementation of <i>Vision</i>is ongoing.  Work will be undertaken during 2015 to prioritise outstanding actions informing the identification of any gaps in service.  The additional &euro;35 million provided for mental health in Budget 2015 will be directed towards the continued prioritised development and reconfiguration of General Adult teams, including Psychiatry of Later Life, and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health teams.  This will be delivered through further recruitment and investment in agencies and services in order to achieve a consistent service provision across all areas.  In addition, the funding will also permit urgent specialist needs to be addressed, including psychiatric intensive care, forensic mental health, mental health intellectual disability care, and psychiatric liaison services. The HSE Operational Plan details the spectrum of services provided by each  Mental Health Service Extended Catchment Area and the priorities for 2015.</p></reply>

This will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing recommendations in the HSE Rare Diseases Plan. To support the Clinical Programme, a Rare Disease Office is being established by the HSE and it is anticipated that this office will be in place later this year.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing within my Department and the HSE to identify potential opportunities for improving the delivery of healthcare through clinical linkages and partnerships on an all-island basis, such as the provision of radiotherapy services at Altnagelvin or the development of an all-island model of care for congenital heart disease. The Rare Disease plan recognises that efforts should be made to realise shared benefits for rare disease patients on the island of Ireland. Officials from my Department have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to consider these issues. The subject of Rare Diseases has also been discussed as a bilateral issue at the North South Ministerial Council. There is broad agreement in principle to identify specialist areas for future rare disease collaboration and develop these further.  In this context, my Department is in consultation with the HSE regarding the scope that may exist for cross border hospice care for children with life limiting and terminal conditions. Any new arrangements would have to be discussed with, and agreed by, the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) in Northern Ireland has carried out a public consultation on its draft implementation plan for the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases, which was published in November 2013.  Under theme 6, &ldquo;Collaboration between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, the Northern Ireland draft Plan commits the DHSSPS to identifying opportunities to work with healthcare policy makers, commissioners and providers in the Republic of Ireland and organisations involved in research in the field of rare diseases. The intention of this would be to maximise the potential benefits arising from collaboration to meet the respective needs of both jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all.  From 1 May, there will be 'late entry loadings' for those aged 35 and over who have not bought health insurance by then.  The loadings are set at 2% per year starting at age 35, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.  Where an individual is resident in the State, there is a grace period until 30 April 2015 to allow as many people as possible to take out health insurance without incurring loadings. </p>  <p>  The Irish public health system provides for two categories of eligibility for persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical cardholders) and limited eligibility (all others).  Persons with full eligibility are entitled to a range of services including all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services.  Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services, subject to certain charges.  Private health insurance in this country is optional.  The eligibility of a resident in the Republic, working elsewhere as a cross-border worker and entitled to treatment by the health service where they work, does not impact upon their capacity to purchase voluntary health insurance in this State.  All residents in this State during the current grace period, who choose to wait until after 30 April 2015 to purchase private health insurance, will be subject to the provisions of the LCR regulations.</p></reply>

These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy</i>, 2012.  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures are being debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The hearings commenced on the 10 March and are due to conclude next week.</p><p>The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.</p><p>The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  On the other hand, the study found that a ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.</p><p>The Public (Health) Alcohol Bill will also make it illegal to market or advertise alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  It provides for the making of regulations regarding the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions, inter alia, for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The existing <i>Code of Practice for Sponsorships by Drinks Companies </i>will be put on a legal footing with statutory powers and penalties.  The provisions in relation to marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years to gauge their effectiveness.</p><p>The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  It is expected that the Bill will be published during this session.</p></reply>

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008.  Notwithstanding that the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services.  This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill consultant, NCHD and nursing posts.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued.  Pending this sanction, the existing moratorium and ECF arrangements will continue to apply.  However the number of nurses employed has already increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months.  This increase encompasses initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts. </p></reply>

The Strategy is accompanied by a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies.  It includes the provision of intensive home care packages, an information campaign and resources for GPs, who are most often the first port of call for people worried about dementia.</p>  <p>  The Strategy acknowledges that while current health and social policy is focussed on caring for people with dementia in their own homes, there will come a time for many when home care may no longer be feasible or appropriate and when long-term residential care will be the best option.  This can particularly arise when 24-hour care is needed or when the person with dementia is living alone.  There is clearly a case for dementia-specific facilities as dementia is sometimes accompanied by behavioural and psychological symptoms such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, wandering and sleep disturbance and these can occur at any stage of the illness.  These behaviours can pose significant challenges for staff and other patients and can be dangerous and distressing for the person with dementia, and a specialist facility is sometimes necessary. </p>  <p>  The Nursing Home Support Scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Upon commencement of the Scheme a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after 3 years.  One of the Terms of Reference for this Review is to examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating/setting prices.  The Review will also make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.  The draft Review requires further analysis and this is ongoing at present.</p></reply>

This review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche Consultants on specific issues which required specialised expertise. </p>  <p>  The review is considering the long term sustainability of the Scheme including funding arrangements.  No decisions have been taken nor plans in place regarding changes to the contributions required of residents.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the broader issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people, how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and whether new care approaches can contribute positively.  A continuum of more efficient care might serve to reduce the number of people requiring nursing home care and limit the projected increase in the cost of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  The draft Review requires further analysis and this is ongoing at present.</p></reply>

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008.  Notwithstanding that the HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services.  This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill consultant, NCHD and nursing posts.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction for staffing will be issued.  Pending this sanction, the existing moratorium and ECF arrangements will continue to apply.  However the number of nurses employed has already increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months.  This increase encompasses initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full-time posts.</p></reply>

The new hospital will be co-located with St James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with a maternity hospital to be developed on campus.  In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Project Brief has now been completed and approved.  The Project Brief sets out details of the specialties to be provided and the planned accommodation.  This will include 384 inpatient beds, all in single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, a further 85 day-care beds and 14 theatres, including three hybrid theatres to facilitate access to imaging during surgery, all in the main hospital.  There will be 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across both the main hospital and the two satellite centres, as well as ED and urgent care facilities.</p>  <p>  A design team is in place and is working on detailed design development with planning submission scheduled for June 2015.  Subject to planning, work is scheduled to commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.</p></reply>

The Review, as well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, will also consider broader issues including how community and residential supports and services should be balanced, and how prices are set for residential care.  The draft Review requires further analysis and this is ongoing at present.</p><p>Government policy will continue to prioritise allowing older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, and ensuring that appropriate residential care is available when it is needed.</p><p>In Budget 2015 the Government allocated &euro;25m to deal with delayed discharges.  This additional funding is being applied across residential and community services to reflect the varying needs of patients.  This funding was targeted to support:</p><p>- 300 extra people under the Nursing Home Support Scheme;</p><p>- 50 additional transitional care beds allocated to the Dublin Hospitals on a named patient basis which will be recycled to the hospitals when available;</p><p>- 65 beds to be brought on stream on a phased basis, during 2015 at Mount Carmel Hospital;</p><p>- 400 extra Home Care Packages to benefit 600 people in the course of the year;</p><p>- The expansion of the community intervention team services in primary care.</p><p>This year hospitals have experienced increased overcrowding in Emergency Departments and an increase in the number of patients whose discharge was delayed.  In order to ensure that patients received the appropriate care in the appropriate setting the Government recently approved additional funding of &euro;74m.  This has been allocated as follows:</p><p>- &euro;44m for the NHSS to support and additional 1,600 places during 2015;</p><p>- &euro;30m to cover the cost of additional transitional care beds through to June and additional community, convalescent and district hospital beds on a permanent basis.</p><p>The projected target levels for people receiving financial support under the NHSS, home help hours and home care packages set out in the 2014 HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan were met or exceeded.  The 2015 Plan projects that 10.3m hours help hours will be provided, that 13,800 people will be in receipt of a home care package and that 22,361 people will receive financial support under the NHSS.  It should be noted that following the recent announcement for additional funding allocated to the NHSS it is now projected that 23,965 people will receive financial support during 2015.</p></reply>

Of this figure, &euro;1.479 billion related to the reduction in funding to the HSE. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Health my key priority has been to achieve a realistic budget for health and social care services.  Improved 2015 budgetary parameters, reflecting the growing strength of the Irish economy, have enabled me to secure additional funds for the delivery of health and social care services this year.  The HSE will have &euro;635 million more available in 2015 than was provided in the original budget for 2014.  This is made up of additional Exchequer funding of &euro;305 million and projected once-off revenues of &euro;330 million.  </p>  <p>  It is not currently possible to estimate with any appropriate degree of accuracy the amount of funding required to end all waiting lists greater than 3 months by the end of 2017.  The amount required will be significantly influenced by the implementation this year of plans to address waiting lists in line with the Minister's targets.  Only when the impact of the implementation of these plans is clear towards the end of this year will it be reasonable to estimate with an appropriate degree of accuracy the resources that may be required.</p></reply>

The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999/112 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance. </p>  <p>  Following discussions on these issues, the HSE and Dublin City Council agreed in principle to address the weaknesses identified, through the provision of a single point of contact for all emergency calls in Dublin.  Under this agreement, all 999/112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region, and the tasking and dispatching of DFB and NAS ambulances, will be from a single centre, the new National Emergency Operations Centre, in Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS Medical Director.  It is important to note that DFB will continue to provide an emergency ambulance service in Dublin.  Only the structures around the clinical governance of the service and the management of calls will change under these proposals.  </p>  <p>  The HSE and Dublin City Council have established a joint implementation group which is currently examining ways to progress the necessary changes over a period of six months.

There are currently 63 teams in place, which are being reconfigured and expanded, in line with the key priorities in the HSE National Service Plan 2015, and supported from the additional investment for Mental Health Services put in place since 2012.</p>  <p>  The HSE waiting list for CAMHS, at February 2015, indicates an overall figure of approximately 3,000 children, of which some 400 are waiting in excess of 12 months.  A significant number of children are seen in accordance with targets agreed in the HSE Service Plan for this year.  A significant proportion of children on the waiting list are waiting less than three months to be seen.  In January 2015, 74 % of children referred were offered an appointment and seen within three months, against the national target of 72%.</p>  <p>  It is unacceptable for a child or adolescent to wait longer than 12 months to be seen by a CAMHS team.  Direct engagement takes place between the HSE Mental Health Division and all Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) on a monthly basis in relation to their performance against agreed performance metrics, including children waiting over one year to be seen.  As part of the National CAMHS Service Improvement Project, detailed work has already commenced with CHOs both to review issues affecting performance, and to prepare for the implementation of Standard Operating Procedures for CAMHS.</p>  <p>  A targeted approach to addressing child/adolescents on the CAMHS waiting list within the Mental Health Division has also been initiated.  All  CAMHS Teams have been requested to review lists of children and revert with the contributory factors identified to include detailed action plans agreed to address the lists for each team. </p>  <p>  CAMHS teams rate the number of complex cases, the number of emergency cases, and the lack of other services in an area as factors having the greatest impact on capacity to respond to demand.  This can in turn lead to less discharges, increased numbers on waiting lists, and longer waiting times for routine assessments.  Successive CAMHS reports over a number of years have referred to the many factors that can affect the capacity of a team to respond to the demands placed on it, including referral numbers, administrative/skills mix back-up supports, collaboration with other services such as primary care, TUSLA or school services, and emergency or complex cases arising at particular times.</p>  <p>  The collaborative measures referred to by the Deputy are the operational responsibility of front-line agencies delivering children's services.  This includes CAMHS working with at-risk children accessing mental health services, and who are also known to TUSLA and the juvenile justice system. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working in partnership with TUSLA, and co-sponsoring research with  NUI Maynooth which is aimed at developing innovative research, building capacity and promoting interagency integration, with a view to developing family-focused mental health services.  A CAMHS Community Forensic Team is being developed in 2015 to work with at-risk children accessing mental health services who are known to TUSLA and the juvenile justice systems.  This Team will be a precursor to the new 10 bed CAMHS Forensic Inpatient facility being developed as part of the new National Forensic Mental Health Hospital in Portrane, due for completion in 2018.  The Team will operate at a national level, liaising with TUSLA and supporting CAMHS nationwide.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is actively engaged with the HSE in relation to monitoring and enhancing all aspects of CAMHS provision over the remainder of this year, as part of the Department's oversight role on the HSE National Service Plan 2015.</p></reply>

The new hospital will be co-located with St James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with a maternity hospital to be developed on campus.  In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Project Brief, which sets out details of the specialties to be provided and the planned accommodation, has been approved.  384 inpatient beds are planned, all in single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation.  There will also be 85 day-care beds and 14 theatres, including three hybrid theatres to facilitate access to imaging during surgery, all in the main hospital.  There will be 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across the main hospital and the two satellite centres, as well as ED and urgent care facilities.</p>  <p>  Site surveys and investigations have been completed, decant plans are being progressed, and a design team is working on detailed design development with planning submission scheduled for June 2015.  Subject to planning, work is scheduled to commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.</p>  <p>  Approximately &euro;39m was spent in the previous phase of this project at the Mater campus.  This expenditure is shown in the Board's 2012 accounts, which have been laid before the Oireachtas.  Work undertaken for the project on that site, in particular development of activity projections and capacity requirements, development of functional requirements and decisions on workflow, adjacency planning and logistics, has been built on in developing the Project Brief for the hospital in its new location.  Minister Howlin has committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  Current estimates are that the core hospital, including both satellite centres, will be delivered within this envelope.  This includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies; it does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately.  Philanthropic and commercial funding streams will be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking, academic and research facilities, and estimates will be reviewed and refined at each stage of the project.</p></reply>

The protective role of breastfeeding extends beyond childhood and is important in the prevention of obesity and chronic diseases in adulthood, including hypertension and diabetes.</p><p>A key goal of the Strategic Action Plan is that all families have the knowledge, skills and support to make and carry out informed infant feeding decisions, particularly those least likely to breastfeed.</p><p>To achieve this the HSE has a National Breastfeeding Co-ordinator and a multi-disciplinary National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee oversees the implementation of breastfeeding strategy and initiatives.  The National Breastfeeding Strategy Implementation Committee have helped facilitate initiatives such as, evidence based breastfeeding policies implemented across the HSE; improvements in breastfeeding education and training; development of breastfeeding education resources; development of guidelines on supporting and protecting breastfeeding in public places; and the protection of breastfeeding through changes in maternity protection legislation and workplace initiatives.</p><p>Staff within HSE maternity and paediatric services and primary care are committed to the promotion, support and protection of breastfeeding.  The HSE Infant Feeding Policy for Maternity and Neonatal Services is based on the <i>Baby Friendly 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding</i>and is the policy of all 19 maternity units.  All 19 maternity units participate in the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and there are 8 designated Baby Friendly Hospitals.  Breastfeeding is promoted to all expectant mothers in the antenatal period at maternity hospitals and in primary care.  Mothers are offered support to breastfeed following birth.  Care is provided by public health nurses in the community following discharge from maternity hospital and individualised care plans are developed for mothers.  Over 200 breastfeeding support groups are provided by the HSE and HSE funded voluntary breastfeeding organisations around the country. </p><p>The HSE launched the first phase of its national breastfeeding campaign <b>&lsquo;</b><i>Every Breastfeed Baby Makes a Difference&rsquo;</i>and promotes an annual National Breastfeeding Week.</p><p>The HSE website is the primary route for providing information, advice and support to women thinking about breastfeeding and those who are breastfeeding.  Feedback from year-round<i>search and display</i>advertising ensures that awareness of the campaign and the invitation to visit the website reaches the target audience.</p><p>HSE breastfeeding information materials including the booklet <i>&lsquo;Breastfeeding &ndash; a good start in life&rsquo;</i>was developed in partnership with Baby Friendly Hospitals Initiative, La Leche League, Association of Lactation Consultants, CUIDI&Uacute; and Friends of Breastfeeding.  It forms part of the HSE Healthy Pregnancy Pack which is distributed widely through maternity hospitals and GPs and over 80,000 are distributed annually.  </p><p>A recent review of the Breastfeeding Strategic Action Plan has highlighted supports being implemented.  These include policies to guide good practice and monitoring within HSE maternity services; enhancements in training for public health nurses and midwives; the expansion of appropriately trained community-led peer support programmes; the development of media messages to promote breastfeeding; and the development readily available information including the national breastfeeding website.</p></reply>

I wish to clarify that LCR relates solely to the current health insurance market, in which context the purchase of health insurance is optional, and the measure should not be misinterpreted as a form of compulsory insurance.</p>  <p>  LCR is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age.  Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all.  The regulations provide for a grace period up until 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings.  From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.  If an individual is resident in the State during the grace period, but chooses to wait and to take out health insurance at a date later than 30 April 2015, then the individual may incur a loading on their premium (depending on the specific circumstances regarding age and periods of previous health insurance cover).  Individuals are therefore encouraged to join the market at younger ages, and in doing so, will help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. </p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it.  A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover when a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependant students.  In addition, a credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is also available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).</p></reply>

This approach will include the development by my Department of a national integrated strategic framework for health workforce planning during 2015.</p><p>A cross-sectoral Working Group will be convened to develop the framework in the near future.  The Group's deliberations will take into account issues including population ageing and any relevant considerations arising from the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

What is proposed are changes to call management and clinical governance, with a view to improving the service.  DFB will continue to provide emergency ambulance services in Dublin, through its own vehicles and staff, and DFB fire vehicles will continue to support the emergency ambulance services, as needed.</p>  <p>  HIQA, in its report of December last year, identified serious patient safety concerns over a lack of coordination between the DFB ambulance service and the NAS.  The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999/112 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance.  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council agreed in principle that all 999/112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region, and the tasking and dispatching of DFB and NAS ambulances, will be from a single centre, the new National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS Medical Director.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements for call management, dispatch and clinical governance are designed to ensure a better, safer service for the people of Dublin.  One centre will receive all calls, have sight of all available resources and dispatch the nearest available resource.  </p>  <p>  The HSE and Dublin City Council have established a joint implementation group, which is currently examining ways to progress the necessary changes over a period of six months.  Dublin Fire Brigade staff, through their union, are being fully consulted on these changes, and a joint Dublin City Council/Union group has been set up to move the process forward.</p></reply>

No. 200 of 2007) signed into law on the 1 May 2007, give prescriptive authority to nurses and midwives under specific conditions.  The legislation allows a registered nurse or midwife to prescribe a range of medications within their scope of practice.  The nurse or midwife must:</p>  <p>  -	have completed an approved six month education programme;</p>  <p>  -	have the appropriate three years clinical experience;</p>  <p>  -	be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board Ireland (NMBI) as a Registered Nurse Prescriber (RNP); and</p>  <p>  -	have authority from their health service provider to prescribe a range of medications.</p>  <p>  The first Nurse and Midwife Prescribers in Ireland were registered with An Bord Altranais now the NMBI, in January 2008.  To date, only a small number of nurses from private nursing homes have undertaken the Certificate in Nursing for Nurse/Midwife Prescribing. </p>  <p>  Professional guidance is already in place with regard to nurse and midwife medicinal product prescribing from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and from the HSE for its services.  The HSE has developed a robust governance process for the safe implementation of nurse and midwife prescribing.  This governance process has been shared with Nursing Homes Ireland.  However, issues concerning governance, risk management and patient safety need to be addressed and appropriate protocols and procedures put in place by the nursing home sector to support and facilitate the extension of this important initiative for medical card patients. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Office of the Chief Nursing Officer of the Department of Health, the Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director of the HSE and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland met with Nursing Homes Ireland in 2014 to progress this initiative.  Nursing Homes Ireland was given guidance on the best approach to the implementation and governance arrangements required to be in place to support the safe prescribing of medicines by nurses in the nursing homes. </p>  <p>  Further engagement has been arranged between the parties to progress the development of the necessary governance arrangements and adapt the national framework for the nursing home sector.  These issues are the subject of current discussions between Nursing Homes Ireland, the HSE Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director and the Chief Nursing Officer&rsquo;s Office of the Department of Health.</p></reply>

In a developed primary care system up to 95% of people's day to day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  Pharmacy services are well placed within the community to provide essential health advice and to support effective care at the lowest level of complexity and in a cost-effective manner.  </p>  <p>  As we continue to experience increased pressure and demand on the resources within the health system it is necessary to consider new and innovative ways to provide the services we require.  Expanding the role of the community pharmacist to include provision of services such as a Minor Ailments Scheme is worth exploring as we seek to further expand and develop the primary care sector.   It is important that such proposals generate real savings on existing public expenditure since the health service continues to operate within tight budget constraints.  </p>  <p>  The Department is examining this issue having regard to the evidence-base for such a service including the application of such schemes in other countries and any contractual or funding implications.</p></reply>

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of  multi-disciplinary primary health care.   </p>  <p>  Primary care infrastructure at thirteen of the 35 locations will be delivered using the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism.  These are Coolock / Darndale - Dublin north city; Summerhill, north inner city Dublin; Kilcock; Wexford Town; Waterford City; Dungarvan; Carrick-on-Suir; Limerick City &ndash; Ballinacurra/Weston; Tuam; Boyle; Ballymote;  Claremorris,  and Westport.  The HSE included Ballinrobe as a suitable substitute for PPP.  Considerable progress has been made in developing this project.  Planning permission has been awarded at all locations.  The pre-selected bidders submitted their tender documentation in early February.  These tenders are being assessed and evaluated.  Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2016 and it is expected that the primary care infrastructure will be delivered by early 2017.  As the tender process is still underway it is not possible, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, to set out the total estimated total completion cost of this project.  Crumlin/Drimnagh and Knocklyon/Rathfarnham recently completed the planning process but not within the timeframe to be included in the PPP project. </p>  <p>  As regards the remaining locations, the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.   </p>  <p>  The following locations have been included in the HSE Capital Plans to be delivered by direct/own-build - Rathdrum; Tullow/Rathvilly/Hacketstown; Dungloe; Laytown/Bettystown and Rowlagh/North Clondalkin.</p>  <p>  Kells is to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism and the HSE's NSP 2015 indicates that its construction will be completed later this year.  The operational lease mechanism is also the preferred delivery option for the following locations - Drogheda north; Balbriggan, Swords and Tralee.</p>  <p>  In its November 2014 advertisement for primary care infrastructure to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism the HSE advertised the following locations - Carrickmacross; Kilkenny city; Cork city for Togher; Clonmel; Thurles; Ennis; Gort and Ballaghadereen.  The closing date for receipt of Expressions of Interest was mid-January 2015.  Currently, the HSE is reviewing all Expressions of Interest received to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process. </p>  <p>  The following parts of your question have been referred to the HSE for direct reply:</p>  <p>  -	The costs incurred to date on the 14 PPP locations;</p>  <p>  -	The costs incurred to date for the remaining locations and where possible estimated total completion costs.</p>  <p>  If he has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days he should contact my Private Office who will follow up.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  All of this work is aimed at achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the United States and improved channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p><p>Throughout his recent visit to the US and in a series of high level contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and at State level, the Taoiseach raised the issue of immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish, stressing that almost every family in Ireland is related to or knows somebody who is caught up in this deeply distressing situation.</p><p>During his meeting with President Obama on 17 March the Taoiseach commended him on his executive action announced late last year.  The Deputy would be aware that this action is currently the subject of legal proceedings in the US federal courts.  The Taoiseach emphasised the need to allow the undocumented to come out of the shadows and be free to travel home for family events.  He also highlighted the issue of those amongst the Irish undocumented who might be eligible for<b></b>visas, but who would be required to return to Ireland for their issuance and hence would require waivers for their prior period of undocumented residence.</p><p>The Taoiseach also pointed to the need for a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US for those who wish to make a contribution there, expressing the hope that a political way forward could be found on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  President Obama spoke of his executive actions on immigration reform and acknowledged the contribution of Irish immigrants to America&rsquo;s development.  He considered that one of the great strengths of the United States had always been its willingness to welcome new immigrants to its shores.</p><p>The Government has had many contacts in recent years with the US to promote immigration reform and to press for any viable opportunities which would be of potential value to the Irish undocumented.  As part of this ongoing process, and on my instructions, a letter was sent from my Department to the US Embassy in Dublin on 24 February in regard to immigration reform and particularly raising the issue of visa waivers.  The US Embassy has acknowledged receipt of the letter and has indicated that it hopes to respond in the near future.  Both I and my Department are keeping in close contact with the US Embassy on this matter.</p><p>I also raised immigration reform issues, including the issue of travel for the Irish undocumented and the visa waiver issue, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.</p><p>The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

At this meeting, I participated in a discussion of the crisis in Yemen with my fellow Ministers and with the High Representative.  In light of this, conclusions were published which set out the EU&rsquo;s views on the steps required to achieve a sustainable solution to the developing crisis in the country at that time.</p>  <p>  Regrettably, the political and security crisis in Yemen has deepened since then.  In recent weeks, a coalition of states led by Saudi Arabia has launched air strikes in response to advances by Houthi forces.</p>  <p>  My Department has not, to date, discussed the recent crisis in Yemen with the Embassies of Middle Eastern or North African countries.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Riyadh, which covers Yemen, is carefully monitoring the evolving crisis and its implications for the region, as well as providing consular assistance to Irish citizens affected by recent events.</p>  <p>  Yemen is expected to feature in discussions at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council on 20 April.  At this meeting I look forward to engaging in a discussion of the crisis in Yemen in light of recent events with the High Representative and with my fellow Ministers, including those from France and the UK.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to comment on the support, if any, provided by other states to the Saudi-led coalition.</p>  <p>  My own view is that peace talks are the optimum way to achieve a political consensus which can restore order to Yemen and avoid a protracted and sectarian conflict with implications for the future of Yemen and for the stability of the region.  I would encourage all parties to engage with UN Special Adviser Jamal Benomar to this end, so that a ceasefire can be agreed and a negotiated political solution found.</p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, contain relevant evidence that demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her.</p><p>The child in question was born in the State in 2012.  Her entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the 1956 Act).<font color="#004080">  </font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.</p><p>Moreover, section 6B(4)(b) of the 1956 Act specifies that certain periods of residence shall not be reckonable for the purposes of section 6A.  This includes periods of residence which are allowed under the Immigration Act 2004 for the purposes of study.</p><p>The evidence of permissions which were issued to the child&rsquo;s parent during the four year period prior to her birth (i.e. 2008 to 2012) show that these were issued for the purpose of study in Ireland.  This residence is not, therefore, reckonable for the purposes of section 6A of the 1956 Act.  Accordingly, the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated and therefore no entitlement to an Irish passport exists under the Act.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a passport was issued in 2012.  This was an error on the part of the Passport Service which was only detected when the child&rsquo;s parents applied to renew the issued passport.  The Passport Service has both met and written to the parents to give notice of its decision to refuse their child a passport under the Act and to explain the reasons, for this course of action.  In accordance with fair procedure, they have been given the opportunity, before the 14<sup>th</sup>of May, to make any representations in the matter or present additional evidence that may warrant the issue of a passport under the Act.  No final decision will be taken in this matter until this period of time for additional information has elapsed.</p><p>In the event that additional information is provided, the application will be reviewed.</p></reply>

The EU has consistently called for the opening of Gaza, and a broad change of Israeli policies there, most recently in the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council in November last.  I made these points directly to the Israeli Foreign Minister during my visit to the region in February.</p>  <p>  During my visit, I saw for myself the huge humanitarian needs in Gaza. Some reconstruction has indeed begun.  UN agencies have to date been concentrating on the huge task of clearing rubble to allow for new building to take place, and in the meantime in repairing houses which were damaged but not destroyed.  At the time of my visit, more than 47,000 people had obtained repair materials for their homes through the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism.  I was pleased to announce Irish funding of &euro;4.7 million for UNRWA and the UN&rsquo;s Emergency Response Fund in the course of my visit.</p>  <p>  Clearly, more needs to be done in all these areas &ndash; for donors to make good on their pledges, for increased supply of construction materials into Gaza, and ultimately for the opening of Gaza to normal trade and movement.</p>  <p>  I do urge the Egyptian Government to try to keep the Rafah crossing point open as much as possible.  However, we must recognize that Egypt is fighting a growing insurgency in northern Sinai, some of which they believe has links to groups in Gaza, and their own security is at present their priority concern.  This was underlined by the attacks in Sinai which killed at least 14 Egyptian police, soldiers and civilians on Sunday, including a bomb attack in El Arish, the city and port directly outside Gaza.  I offer our condolences to the families of all those killed or injured.</p></reply>

I urge all responsible parties to support this agreement and the work of their governments to finally bring it to a successful conclusion.The extended presence at the negotiations in Lausanne of the EU High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of the seven states involved has been a further testament of the seriousness and intent with which they have pursued a diplomatic solution to this difficult issue over a long period, and in particular over the last two years.</p>  <p>  What has been achieved is a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a set of understandings in principle on the shape of a final agreement.  Hard and serious work remains to be done to iron out the technical details and produce a final agreement by June, as is the intention.  There may still be difficulties ahead and a continuing need for compromises, but the parties have reached outline understandings on the main issues, and there is every reason to believe that they will also reach a final agreement.</p>  <p>  The outline agreement will allow Iran to continue to develop its civil nuclear power programme, while providing reassurance to its neighbours and others that there will be no military nuclear programme.  The agreement will provide for removal in due course of the sanctions that have been placed on Iran in relation to this dispute, as well as the continued monitoring of the Iranian programme by the appropriate international agency, the IAEA.</p>  <p>  There will be those, on both sides of the issue, who will wish to reject this agreement and seek tougher terms.  This is unrealistic.  I urge them instead to welcome this agreement as a major step forward towards the peaceful resolution of a long running dispute, which has had the potential to significantly further destabilize an already volatile region.</p>  <p>  The agreement which has been reached is a fair and balanced one, and has, I believe, the overwhelming support of governments and responsible leaders around the world.  I commend all those who have worked to achieve it.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-04-15a.1848.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015041500096#WRWW01700"><p>The protracted crisis in Syria and the region has led to immense human suffering.  More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12 million people in need of life-saving support within Syria.  Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned by reports of the suffering of the remaining population of the Yarmouk camp on the outskirts of Damascus.  I condemn the attack on the camp by ISIS and the use of so-call barrel-bombs against the camp by regime forces.  I call on all parties to cease armed activity in this camp, which is home to thousands of already-displaced Palestinians.  There are approximately 18,000 civilians remaining in Yarmouk camp, 3,500 of them children.  Most of the 200,000 people who used to live there have fled in the last three years, largely due to the prolonged siege of the camp by Assad regime forces.  Ireland calls on all parties to provide unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, both in Yarmouk and elsewhere in Syria.</p>  <p>  One of the most difficult features of the Syria conflict is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid, or are able to receive it only sporadically.  Insecurity and bureaucratic restrictions have hampered aid delivery both in areas controlled by the Syrian Government and in opposition-held areas.  The deliberate targeting of humanitarian workers by ISIS makes it particularly difficult to reach those in areas it controls.  Ireland has consistently advocated for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access and respect by all parties for International Humanitarian Law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the most generous international contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis and has provided over &euro;32 million in humanitarian support to Syria since 2011, through UN partners and NGOs.  At the UN Pledging Conference for Syria, which took place in Kuwait on 31 March, Ireland announced a pledge of &euro;12 million for 2015.  This is in addition to our core funding to many of the organisations which are responding to the crisis, including UN agencies and the Red Cross.  In addition, several members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have served with UN agencies working on the Syria response.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Sherlock specifically raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about Yarmouk with the Commissioner General of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) when they met on 31 March at Syria Pledging Conference.  The lack of consistent access to the camp for UNRWA in recent months was already a serious matter of humanitarian concern, even before the current attack.  Irish Aid provides core funding of &euro;4 million to UNRWA annually, with &euro;1m of this earmarked for UNRWA&rsquo;s activities in Lebanon.  In 2014, in recognition of the impact of the Syria refugee crisis, Ireland provided an additional &euro;1 million to UNRWA for its emergency work in Lebanon.</p>  <p>  While the immediate imperative is to respond to the escalating humanitarian needs on the ground, humanitarian assistance will not provide a lasting solution to this crisis.  Ultimately, what the people of Syria need is an end to the conflict and the prospect of a peaceful future.  It is therefore vital that we persevere with international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis in Syria and the wider region.</p></reply>

Minimums and maximums apply to these grants which reflect the estimated minimum running costs of small schools and the economies of scale that may be achieved in larger schools. </p><p>  Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs.  These classes have a lower Pupil Teacher ratio and as such the unit cost per pupil is higher. </p><p>  It is extremely difficult to make valid comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post primary levels.  However it is accepted that the maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools. In general, second level schools have a lower pupil teacher ratio, resulting in more classrooms and this would lead to higher per unit costs in second level schools for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p><p>  In addition the second level capitation is required to cover a different range of expenditures.  Second level schools provide a broader curriculum, including technical subjects where the costs of materials may be greater than at primary level. In addition, specialist equipment and rooms are required for some subjects, leading to higher maintenance/replacement costs.</p><p>  I am determined that education will be prioritised for further investment in future years, and I believe that increasing the staffing and funding of our schools should be priorities for such investment.</p></reply>

Many thousands of students from the EU and around the world come to Ireland for full-time or short-term programmes.  The vast majority of providers of English language training in the State operate to a high standard and are motivated by the desire to enable learners to reach their potential.  However, it is evident that a minority of providers do not operate to the same standards, with serious implications for students and the reputation of the wider international education sector.</p><p>  For this reason, I announced robust regulatory reforms to the international education sector together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2nd September 2014.  These reforms include specific measures to quality assure the English language teaching industry.</p><p>  A key pillar of these reforms is a strengthened and more integrated inspection regime of providers of international education including English language colleges, which entails an enhanced inspection function for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) which will be linked to Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.  A number of reforms relating to the student work concession (under which non-EEA students have access to the labour market) were introduced on 1st January 2015. </p><p>  A new quality assurance process to control entry by English language providers to the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) &ndash; the list of eligible programmes for immigration purposes &ndash; is being finalised by officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and will be submitted to Government shortly for approval.</p><p>  Another key pillar of the regulatory reforms is the International Education Mark (IEM) and related Code of Practice.  The IEM was proposed in Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010 &ndash; 2015 as a means of enhancing the quality and promotion of international education in Ireland.  The IEM confirms that a provider has demonstrated their capacity and commitment to provide a high-quality educational experience to international students.  The Code of Practice includes requirements relating to the protection of enrolled learners, treatment of fees and tax compliance, and will also address other 'non-academic' issues such as recruitment, marketing and accommodation. Providers of English language training will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code before being authorised to use the Mark.</p><p>  The Mark will be used both as a driver of quality assurance within institutions, including English language colleges, and as a marketing tool to underpin the promotional activities of Enterprise Ireland in seeking to attract international learners to Ireland. In addition, the Mark will be used for immigration purposes.  From 2016 it will become a requirement that providers wishing to recruit English language students from outside the EEA have authorisation to use the Mark. English language providers authorised to use the Mark will also be subject to ongoing monitoring and review.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the regulations governing the operation of ACELS, all applicant schools undergo an announced site inspection during Stage 2 of the application process.  With regard to unannounced inspections of recognised ACELS English language schools, these take place when: (i) There is a change of ownership of the English language school; (ii) A new general or academic manager(s) is appointed; or (iii) There is a change of premises, or an additional premises is added to the school (in this case the additional premises is inspected).</p><p>  All English language schools with ACELS recognition are obliged to inform the ACELS Recognition Committee of any of the 3 above changes and on that basis, an unannounced inspection is arranged.  The English language school in question will not know the date of the inspection but will be aware that an inspection is forthcoming.</p><p>An unannounced inspection may also be triggered on foot of a complaint. </p><p>  Therefore the number of unannounced inspections per annum is contingent on the number of incidents of the above.  As an approximate estimate, there tends to be between 15 &ndash; 20 unannounced inspections per annum.  There has been no decision taken to increase or decrease the number of unannounced inspections in the last 12 months.</p></reply>

At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils (at least 20% of total enrolment) that require language (EAL) support.  These allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Staffing Appeals Board.

They consist of one Director, one Deputy Director, five Assistant National Co-ordinators and eleven Advisors.  In the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) there are 13 teachers currently seconded to the service and they consist of one National Co-ordinator, two Assistant National Co-ordinators and ten Regional Development Officers.  There are also a number of Associates and Facilitators who work on a part time basis for both services when required.</p><p>  There are transitional arrangements in place to facilitate the continuing operation of the SESS and the NBSS during the transition phase to the new Inclusion Support Service (ISS).  The current secondment arrangements for teachers to work with both the SESS and the NBSS will continue to apply into the 2015/16 school year.</p><p>  Considerations with regard to the manner in which the new Inclusion Support Service will be incorporated within the existing NCSE operational structures, and the full staffing implications which may arise from the amalgamation of these bodies, is ongoing, and will be established during the course of the integration of the services.</p><p>  While on secondment, teachers continue to be employed by their respective Boards of Management who are responsible for the retention of any sick or maternity leave records.  Teachers on secondment to the support services are not replaced while on sick or maternity leave.</p></reply>

All schools have therefore been provided with resource teaching hours to allocate to pupils with Mild General Learning Difficulty.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recommended the introduction of a new resource allocation model for schools.  I recently announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year. In taking this decision, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented.  Through consultations, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from Parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders. However, there has not been sufficient time to address all of the concerns which have been raised in advance of the 2015 school year.</p><p>  In the context of the recent announcement that the proposed new model for allocating resource teachers to schools will not now be introduced from September 2015, I agreed to review the particular position in relation to educational provision for children with Down syndrome in mainstream schools.  On 24th of March, I announced that the Government has agreed that additional resources will be allocated to schools, as an interim measure, to support those children with Down syndrome, who are not already supported through the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) annual allocation process. </p><p>I advised that this measure was being introduced in recognition of the length of time it will take to introduce the new resource teacher model and the fact that children with Down syndrome experience a cluster of difficulties relating to this syndrome, in addition to general learning difficulties, including speech and language developmental delays.  As my Department is continuing to develop the new allocation model for schools, and is currently working to devise a pilot of the new model, I do not propose to amend the existing allocation process further, pending the introduction of a new allocation model.</p></reply>

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons.</p>  <p>  The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature. For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage. </p>  <p>  There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools. Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State. Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools. The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site/building is owned by the relevant school patron.</p>  <p>  Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period. </p>  <p>  It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools. The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron. A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron. Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational). </p>  <p>  The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s. As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. </p>  <p>  Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served. Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population. There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.</p>  <p>  With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. </p>  <p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. </p>  <p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy. </p>  <p>  In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons. The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature. For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage.</p>  <p>  There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools. Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State. Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools. The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site/building is owned by the relevant school patron.</p>  <p>  Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.</p>  <p>  It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools. The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron. A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron. Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational).</p>  <p>  The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s. As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. </p>  <p>  Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served. Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population. There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.</p>  <p>  With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.</p>  <p>  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students. The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained.  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding.  However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position.  It was agreed that the forum would consider appropriate measures in relation to the rates of pay of school secretaries and caretakers in the event that a review of the Public Service Agreements recommended changes to the benefit of those public servants earning &euro;35,000 or less per annum.  This is currently the priority for the Forum and discussions are ongoing.  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of "public servant" used in that Act.  The fact that such staff come within the definition of "public servant" solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p></reply>

Some confusion may have arisen on this point and I would like to take the opportunity to clarify matters for the Deputy.</p><p>In the first instance it is important to explain the historical context in which the current patronage system has evolved and the arrangements whereby there is associated school property ownership by religious patrons.  The historical and societal development of primary education provision in Ireland has resulted in the current school patronage system which is of a predominantly denominational nature.  For many years, religious orders and local parishes were centrally involved in establishing and running schools in Ireland, leading to the majority of primary schools being under religious patronage.</p><p>There are in excess of 3,000 primary schools.  Many of these are long-established and pre-date the foundation of the State.  Most of our schools were founded on the initiative of a local patron, generally one of the main established churches (Catholic or Church of Ireland).  Historically, the patron provided the site for the school and also contributed to the cost of building and running schools.  The vast majority of primary schools are thus privately owned i.e. the site/building is owned by the relevant school patron.</p><p>Where state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest.  This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust.  These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.  </p><p>It is important to clarify and to point out that there is no planned change to the status of primary schools.  The ethos of a school is determined by the Patron.  A Board of Management manages the school on behalf of the Patron.  Section 15 (2) (b) of the Education Act, 1998 makes it clear that one of the duties of the Board of Management is to uphold the ethos of the school and to be accountable to the patron for doing so.  That applies to any school (denominational or multi-denominational).</p><p>The arrangements referred to, in terms of agreement to put in place a Deed of Variation, which provide for a variation on the original terms of Charging Leases or Declarations of Trust, date back to the 1990s.  As a result of negotiations in the late 1990s on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease.  The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property.  Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing.</p><p>Irish schools are catering for a significantly more diverse population nowadays than the population that they traditionally served.  Many schools have made significant efforts to welcome this more diverse population.  There has been a positive contribution by patrons, school management and teachers to welcoming pupils including those from different cultural and belief backgrounds.</p><p>With regard to admission policies, irrespective of property or Charging Lease arrangements, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.</p><p>The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that such a school can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.</p><p>The objective of the recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill is to provide an over-arching framework to ensure that how schools decide on who is enrolled and who is refused a place in schools is more structured, fair and transparent.</p><p>The Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.</p><p>The Bill provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p></reply>

It is proposed to finalise the policy proposals in light of the consultation process and to bring these findings back to Government by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The Minister has already acknowledged that Gaeltacht schools would require a range of additional supports to enable them to address the specific needs of their students.</p></reply>

The rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively.  These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s.  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the resultant administrative and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process.  Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p>  <p>  The estimated additional annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly discs is in the region of &euro;50m.  A loss of income from this source would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.</p>  <p>  I have no plans currently to review the basis for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis.</p></reply>

Overall funding reductions to the LCDP over the five year period of its operation amounted to some 29%.  However, it should be noted that this was commensurate with the need to reduce Government spending across a range of public funded schemes during those years.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP was subject to a public procurement process.  Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender and Local and Community Development Committees (LCDCs) have finalised contracts with the winning tenderers.</p>  <p>  Within the constraints of the prevailing budgetary situation, I have been particularly conscious of the need to prioritise community programme funding and to make the maximum contribution to tackling disadvantage, job creation and economic recovery.  As a tool to assist with this, a Resource Allocation Model, or RAM, has been developed which allows relative disadvantage to be measured across all census areas.  In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, my Department has in recent years worked to ensure that funding is protected for those areas which the RAM shows have greatest needs.  This principle was used in deciding on funding allocations for SICAP and I am satisfied that the funding allocated is a fair allocation of resources for all the areas concerned.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a small number of Local Development Companies (LDCs) that delivered the LCDP did not secure SICAP contracts.  My Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are solely for the Board of each company, as the employer, to manage.  Each funding Department is responsible for its own funding and contractual arrangements with the LDCs.</p>  <p>  My Department is, however, providing practical financial support to LDCs to facilitate an orderly closure of the LCDP and the move to the new arrangements.  This includes financial assistance to companies to deal with statutory redundancy payments and such other supports as are considered appropriate in the context of the closure of the LCDP.  It should be noted that Pobal are currently liaising with LDCs on these issues.</p></reply>

Accordingly, my Department recently launched the Expressions of Interest (EOI) process for the programme and any entity, including Comhar na hOile&aacute;in, wishing to be considered as a Local Action Group for their area has until 15 May 2015 to submit an EOI.

An application for a refund of motor tax may be made where the owner of a vehicle has ceased to use that vehicle due to illness, injury or other physical disability, provided that there are at least three months remaining on the disc at the time of application.  However, refunds are not made where the annual rate of duty applicable to a vehicle does not exceed &euro;119.

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council.  HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October.  Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  There are now over 1,400 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.</p>  <p>  During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee.  Data for this report is being gathered from pilot sites and a progress report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly.  Based on data gathered for the review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP as part of the pilot on an incremental basis this year.  While no implementation date has yet been agreed, my Department is in contact with Donegal County Council in relation to their inclusion in the next phase of HAP statutory pilot.</p></reply>

On 18 December 2014, in the D&aacute;il, the Government provided its response to the recommendations in that report.  The Government has accepted the two main recommendations of the Report - to retain the current PRSTV system for elections and to establish an Electoral Commission.  I published a consultation paper on the Electoral Commission on 27 January 2015 and discussed the paper with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 10 March 2015 as part of the pre-legislative process for an Electoral Commission Bill.  The Committee is now engaging in a consultation process on the paper and will report their recommendations to me in due course.</p>  <p>  The Convention also recommended in its report that measures should be introduced to improve voter turnout and improve the accuracy of the electoral register.  The Government accepted these recommendations, indicating that it would seek to implement measures to achieve improvements in voter turnout and acknowledging that the highest possible levels of accuracy should be a constant and continuing objective for all with responsibility for the electoral register.</p>  <p>  The Government did not accept the recommendation for larger D&aacute;il constituencies, with the smallest constituency size being a 5 seater, nor the recommendation that D&aacute;il membership be more than 159 TDs, based on a ratio of one TD to every 30,000 of the electorate.</p>  <p>  The Government agreed that further consideration should be given in due course by the proposed Electoral Commission to the recommendations that there should be greater access to postal voting, that there should be a move away from the alphabetical order of candidates on the ballot paper and that polling hours and polling days be extended.  Such consideration would include advising in detail on the electoral and operational implications, including costs, of implementing changes in these areas.</p>  <p>  The Government also noted the Convention recommendation concerning the introduction of a relevant political education programme in schools and drew attention to the fact that much is being done in this regard already in the education sector.</p></reply>

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering (including dog fouling) is a matter for local authorities.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally within the legislation provided, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities.  Section 16 of the Control of Dogs Acts, 1986 and 1992 sets out the powers of dog wardens.  In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Acts provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on-the-spot fine to an individual believed of committing a prescribed offence under the Act.</p><p>While my Department does not collate statistics on the number of fines issued by local authorities in relation to specific offences, such as dog fouling offences, data is available under the local authority service indicators report on the number of fines issued generally, along with the number of prosecutions and convictions, under the Litter Pollution Acts.  The 2013 local authority service indicators report, together with previous years&rsquo; reports, is available at the following link: .</p><p>I believe that there are sufficient penalties in place to deal with the issue of dog fouling when enforced under the Litter Pollution Acts.  Raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people are key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but, ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.</p></reply>

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process.  A total of 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion. </p><p>Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered. </p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided are set out in the table. </p><p>The review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process. A number of meetings have also taken place with representative organisations, including the Disability Federation of Ireland. I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming weeks. </p><p><font color="#333333">  Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</font><table><tr><th>ORGANISATION</th><th>FUNDING</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The annual cost of running the online facility is some &euro;12.5m. The cost incurred by the local authority system in administering the motor tax service varies from authority to authority, depending on the level of applications made in person or by post, and on the number of local offices processing applications within the functional area of each authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own expenditure requirements in respect of the service, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. Each half-yearly or quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process. Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period. </p></reply>

This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context , &euro;220 million of the overall Leader programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas.  In determining the county allocations, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable allocation. However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county. The methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage. Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the Leader elements of the RDP. </p>  <p>  While the allocation for the Leader element of the 2014-2020 Programme is less than the value of the Leader element of 2007 &ndash; 2013 programme, I am confident that within the confines of the fiscal environment we have experienced in the recent past, the Government has allocated the maximum amount possible to support the Leader elements of the 2014-2020 programme. The Government&rsquo;s drive to increase coordination at a local level and the commitment to the delivery of the recommendations in the CEDRA report, will ensure that the impact of the funding, while decreased, will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities.  In this context, I have no plans to review the funding allocations.</p></reply>

The targeted social housing provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  The Strategy will be delivered in two phases. Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017. In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units. In addition, the implementation of the range of actions under <i>Construction 2020 </i>will support increased supply in the wider housing market. </p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: . </p><p>The latest summary of social housing assessments, as of 7 May 2013, provides data on the number of households on local authority waiting lists at that date across a range of categories broken down by local authority.  The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>also includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the summary of social housing assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards.</p><p>Details on the number of households on the waiting lists as per the 2013 assessment in the four Dublin authorities are outlined in the table below: <table><tr><th>LOCAL AUTHORITY</th><th>NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS</th></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>6,217 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td>6,020</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown County Council </td><td>3,406 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td>16,171 </td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>31,814 </td></tr></table>The full 2013 results are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>On 1 April 2015, I announced housing targets for each local authority area to 2017, with associated funding of some &euro;1.5 billion. On a national basis this significant announcement is designed to accommodate 25% of the social housing waiting list. The combined funding total for the Dublin local authorities comes to over &euro;500 million for the period 2015 to 2017. This funding underpins ambitious housing targets that have been set for the Dublin local authorities in that period to ensure strong delivery where the need is greatest. Details of targets and provisional funding allocations for the Dublin local authorities are set out in the table below.</p><p>The full announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link.</p><p><table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Provisional Funding Allocation (Current and Capital in Euro) </th><th>Targets 2015 - 2017 (No. of Housing Units per LA) </th></tr><tr><td>DLR County Council </td><td>&euro;61,030,770 </td><td>681 </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council </td><td>&euro;292,194,455 </td><td>3347 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td>&euro;81,041,413 </td><td>1376 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council </td><td>&euro;73,255,580 </td><td>1445 </td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to land available for housing purposes, my Department has recently carried out a national survey of all lands zoned for residential or primarily residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland in to determine the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for primarily residential development purposes. Details of the survey can be found at:</p><p>Furthermore, the Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, is updating the data and developing a more extensive and detailed database and GIS map of local authority owned sites in order to support the implementation of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. The database will include all local authority owned lands and Land Aggregation Scheme lands showing their location, size, boundaries and other information. This map will be up-dated over the course of the Strategy to record the development and use of lands. </p><p>As part of that exercise local authorities are in the process of returning land data and assessment results and a full analysis of this data has now commenced.  All suitable sites owned by Local Authorities will be considered in the context of future social housing building programmes.</p><p>Tackling impediments to the proper functioning of the construction sector is another important priority for this Government, and already a number of targeted initiatives have been introduced by the Government under <i>Construction 2020</i>that have supported the recovery of the construction sector. In March 2015, both my Department and the Department of Finance held conferences, bringing together key delivery agents including, investors, developers, approved housing bodies, local authorities, Government departments and public bodies , to explore how viable construction and development projects can be progressed.</p><p>A structured, formal process of engagement with proposers of social housing in the investment and delivery area has been put in place under a Clearing House Protocol. This Protocol sets out the process for future engagement with such proposers and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.</p><p>In addition, a wide range of initiatives are being progressed under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy. A number of these are being advanced in the context of the Planning and Development (No.1) Bill which I expect will be published early in the current Oireachtas session. One of the measures involved will see the introduction of a vacant site levy whereby local authorities, in certain urban centres, will have the power to apply levies on sites which are left vacant and under utilised.</p></reply>

However, the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) review published by my Department last year concluded that the system is not functioning as intended, with a lack of basic information, poor structure, poor environmental outcomes in the form of large stockpiles of waste tyres and somewhere between 24% - 50% of waste tyres unaccounted for. The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.  To address these deficiencies, I recently announced a Producer Responsibility Scheme for tyres which will comprise the following main features:</p><p>-A single compliance scheme for end-of-life tyres to be operated by Repak,</p><p>-The ending of the option for producers to &ldquo;self-comply&rdquo; under the Regulations,</p><p>-Formalisation of the existing recycling charge into a visible environmental management charge,</p><p>-The level of this visible environmental charge would be set by my Department and reviewed in two years,</p><p>-As part of the detailed design of the scheme, consideration by my Department, in consultation with the tyres and waste industry, as to whether the funding model is predicated upon a front-loaded or back-loaded model,</p><p>-A full audit and registration and reporting component (&lsquo;black box&rsquo;) with a role for the WEEE Register Society, and</p><p>-An underpinning of the new regime, including enforcement and compliance measures, by a robust legislative base, including fixed penalty notices for certain breaches. </p><p>After almost a year of discussions with representatives of all sectors of the tyre industry in Ireland, I believe that my decision to introduce a full producer responsibility initiative in this waste stream is the appropriate response to the very serious problems which were identified in the sector by the PRI Review on Tyres and Waste Tyres.  The problems identified require an overhaul of existing structures, but I consider that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses.  Furthermore, moving to a single producer responsibility scheme for tyres should not increase the cost of disposal of used tyres, nor should it lead to an increase in the level of illegal dumping of tyres. Indeed, under the new arrangements, I expect to see a reduction in the current level of illegal dumping and in the costs borne by local authorities for the remediation of stockpiles of illegally dumped tyres. </p><p>My Department is continuing to work with the tyre sector to agree on the precise details of how the Tyres PRI will work. In order to bring additional focus to this work and the concerns which industry have raised, the Tyres Working Group, the industry stakeholder group working with my Department, recently decided to establish five sub-groups to examine and develop an approach and solutions on certain key issues. These five sub-groups are as follows;</p><p>-distance sellers and treatment of information,</p><p>-registration and reporting of producers,</p><p>-transitional arrangements,</p><p>-the financial model, and</p><p>-enforcement.</p><p>These sub-groups held their first meeting earlier this month and a number of further meetings have been arranged during April.  The sub-groups will submit proposals for consideration by the main Tyres Working Group at its next meeting in May.  It is the intention of the Tyres Working Group to keep the wider tyre sector informed of both the progress and decisions made on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

The only Exchequer funding provided to B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is or Irish Water in 2012 or 2013 was a grant of &euro;0.57m to Irish Water in 2013 to fund the cost of a pilot study in relation to Phase 2 of the Water Metering Programme which is targeted at metering those properties that were not meterable in the Phase 1 Programme.  In terms of its operations, Irish Water receives funding for capital investment purposes and towards its operating costs. In that context, in 2014, Irish Water received &euro;239m for capital purposes &ndash; this was provided by way of &euro;185m capital contribution from the Minister for Finance and a further &euro;54m in the form of a convertible loan. This is broadly equivalent to the &euro;240m in Exchequer resources devoted to the Water Services Investment Programme in 2013. A further capital contribution of &euro;222m in respect of 2015 has also been provided to Irish Water by the Minister for Finance, and it is planned to provide a further capital contribution of &euro;184m in 2016.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water received a subvention of some &euro;439 million in 2014 for operational expenditure, to fund water-related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities and which would, historically, have been met by local authorities from their own resources, non-domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund. An amount of &euro;399m has been earmarked in 2015 and &euro;479m in 2016 in respect of operational subvention. This subvention will be paid in respect of the child allowance (21,000 litres per child per annum), a product subsidy and capping domestic water charges. In addition, provision has been made for the provision of a working capital loan to Irish Water of up to &euro;96m in 2015. </p>  <p>  In relation to the broader water sector reform programme, my Department has provided funding of some &euro;21m during the period 2012 to date. The majority of this expenditure related to funding provided to local authorities to meet the costs of the pre-installation survey required as part of the domestic metering programme and the staffing costs of the Water Services Transition Office, which was put in place to ensure appropriate arrangements for engagement with the local authority sector during the reform process. </p></reply>

Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws, including bye-laws specifying times or days during which waste is to be made available for collection. Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 , I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.  My role as Minister is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the relevant environmental regulatory bodies, such as local authorities, operate. In that context, I intend to introduce legislation soon to significantly reform the regulation of household waste collection, including introducing measures to require collectors to meet certain minimum standards of customer service. It will also become a statutory requirement for all collectors to have customer charters in place. I will be setting out in law what the minimum content of these customer charters will be, so that standards of service are improved and are consistent.</p></reply>

Electors who are eligible for, but not already included in, the postal voters list may apply for entry into the supplement to these lists.  Such applications must be received by the relevant registration authority by 25 April 2015 in order to be considered for the referendums being held on 22 May 2015. </p><p>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to extend existing arrangements for postal voting. In responding to the recommendation of the Constitution on the Convention in their fourth report that there should be greater access to postal voting, the Government proposed that an Electoral Commission be tasked in due course with considering the issue and advising in detail on the electoral and operational implications, including costs, of implementing change in this area. As regards the Electoral Commission, I published a consultation paper on 27 January 2015. I discussed the paper with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on 10 March 2015 as part of the pre-legislative process for an Electoral Commission Bill. The Committee is now engaging in a consultation process on the paper and will report their recommendations to me in due course.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.<b></b>The 2004 Act applies to all dwellings the subject of a tenancy.  For the purposes of the Act, a dwelling means a self-contained residential unit. Section 3(2)(a) of the Act provides that the Act does not apply to a dwelling that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business. </p><p>The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements in relation to design and construction that apply to a new building or to an existing building undergoing an extension, material alteration or a material change of use.  A change from commercial to residential use constitutes a material alteration.</p><p>Compliance with the building regulations is primarily the responsibility of the owner and the builder of a building.  In instances where there has been a material alteration that does not comply with the building regulations, the matter should be reported to the relevant local authority.  Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 31 local building control authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, within five years of the date on which the building or works was completed.  </p><p>In addition, all landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008. These regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as fire safety, structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation and safety of gas and electrical supply.  Responsibility for enforcement of the standards regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  The penalties for non-compliance with the regulations can amount to a fine and/or imprisonment for up to six months.  Local authorities also have the power to serve prohibition notices on properties which disbar the landlord from renting the property out until such time as it complies with the standards. Local authorities have an active programme of targeted inspections in place to ensure compliance with standards.  Where a tenant believes that their rented dwelling does not comply with the minimum standards for rented accommodation, they should contact their local authority to arrange an inspection.</p></reply>

These tasks may include activities such as initial type-testing of products, inspection of factory production control and surveillance of factory production control. </p><p>My Department understands that the European Standardisation Body (known as CEN) is currently developing a number of harmonised European standards for both gully tops and manhole tops for vehicular and pedestrian areas which, when formally adopted and cited in the Official Journal of the European Union, will bring such products within the scope of the Construction Products Regulation.</p><p>As matters currently stand, <i>I.S. EN 124:1994 Gully tops and manhole tops for vehicular and pedestrian areas</i>is the relevant standard applicable to gully tops. This standard is not harmonised and therefore the requirements of the Construction Products Regulation do not apply (i.e. CE marking is not mandatory).

It is at the discretion of the local authorities, which have responsibilities for enforcement of both the Litter Pollution Act and the Waste Management Act, to decide whether a specific incident warrants the application of either Act. </p><p>I intend to introduce legislation soon to significantly reform the regulation of household waste collection, including introducing measures to require householders to demonstrate how they are managing their household waste.It is my intention that an awareness and education campaign will be rolled out in advance of this measure and other significant reforms, including the introduction of weight-based charges for household collection , to allow householders an appropriate period to be informed and become familiar with the new regime applying to household waste collection.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that these measures are appropriate and will ensure a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry into the future thereby ensuring that homeowners and construction clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve.</p><p>In tandem with the new regulations, the online Building Control Management System (BCMS), which was developed by local authorities, also came into operation on 1 March 2014 in line with the commencement of the new regulations in order to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector. The system will facilitate a risk analysis of all projects for which commencement notices are received, which will inform each building control authority&rsquo;s own inspection arrangements thus ensuring that available inspection resources are used to optimum effect.</p><p>The enhanced professionalism and accountability arising from the arrangements under the <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014</i>will lead to improved quality in all new buildings and will reduce risk within the construction sector.</p><p>In terms of sound quality, Part E (Sound) of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements in relation to sound insulation in attached dwellings and apartment blocks and makes provision for certain constructions to offer &ldquo;reasonable resistance&rdquo; to both airborne and impact sound. The related Technical Guidance Document E provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part E in practical terms.</p><p>Over the course of 2009 to 2014, my Department undertook a comprehensive review of Part E in order to secure improvements to the sound performance of attached dwellings and apartment blocks. The recent <i>Building Regulations (Part E Amendment) Regulations 2014</i>and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document E - Sound</i>(2014), which come into effect on 1 July 2015, establish new performance standards to improve the overall sound insulation performance of dwellings and introduce a completion testing regime on a proportion of all new dwellings in a development to ensure these new minimum standards are achieved in practice . Furthermore, specific measures have been introduced to mitigate the build-up of reverberant sound in the common access areas in apartment blocks, which will also contribute to improved occupant comfort .</p><p>Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations sets out the minimum statutory requirements in relation to the thermal performance of buildings. The current <i>Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011</i>and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document L &ndash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy &ndash; Dwellings</i>(2011), which came into effect on 1 December 2011, introduced a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings (including apartments) and marked an important step on the road to nearly zero energy buildings which is required by 31 December 2020 under Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings. Part L requires that space and water heating systems should be energy efficient, with efficient heat sources and effective controls . More specifically, the regulations require that oil or gas fired boilers achieve a seasonal efficiency of 90% while the guidance provided in respect of biomass boilers is that the seasonal efficiency should be not less than 77%. It is envisaged that further thermal efficiency improvements will be introduced under Part L to meet our obligations under Directive 2010/31/EU in advance of the end 2020 deadline.</p><p>My Department has produced design guidelines in the form of <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities</i>(2007)for the use of all involved in the provision of housing, including architects, urban designers, engineers, planners, quantity surveyors, developers, practitioners and housing authorities.  These guidelines identify the principles and criteria that are important in the design of housing in order to facilitate the delivery of better homes, better neighbourhoods and better urban spaces.  Appropriate guidance is already provided on space requirements and room sizes in both dwellings and apartments to facilitate the provision of good quality living environments for occupants.</p></reply>

This is in line with Government policy to ensure that local government is well positioned to support the effective and efficient delivery of local and rural development. In this context, &euro;220 million of the overall programme complement for the 2014-2020 period has been allocated based on administrative or county boundaries to 28 sub-regional areas. </p><p>It should be noted that LEADER funding for the 2007-2013 programming period was not allocated on the basis of county boundaries but to individual Local Action Groups on completion of the Local Development Strategy process. In addition, the allocations were amended in 2012, following a change to the EU co-financing rate arising from the financial crisis. This resulted in a decrease in the overall programme allocation. </p><p>Both Carlow and Kilkenny were each serviced by a single Local Development Company for the LEADER elements of the RDP 2007-2013. The table below details the allocations, original and revised, to both companies for that programme period. The table also sets out the allocation for each county for the 2014-2020 programme period. It also details the percentage of the overall programme complement allocated to Carlow and Kilkenny, as well as their percentage of the average allocation. <table><tr><th>Local Action Group </th><th>Original 2007-2013 LEADER A location </th><th>Revised LEADER 2007-2013 LEADER Allocation (A) </th><th>LEADER 2014-2020 County Allocation (B) </th><th>% Reduction <br /><br />(A-B)</th><th>% of the Overall2014-2020 County Allocations</th><th>% of the Average2014-2020 County Allocations</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co Development Partnership </td><td>&euro;8,878,177.00 </td><td>&euro;7,619,278.00 </td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43 </td><td>- 15.78 % </td><td>2.92 % </td><td>81.67 % </td></tr><tr><td>Co Kilkenny LEADER Partnership </td><td>&euro;11,523,729.00 </td><td>&euro;13,587,910.00 </td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91 </td><td>- 42.66 % </td><td>3.54 % </td><td>99.17 % </td></tr></table></p><p>In determining the county allocations for the 2014-2020 LEADER programme, three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each county was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each received a viable level of funding. However, Cork County was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county, as the overall population outside of the city is almost twice that of any other county. </p><p>While a specific cost benefit analysis was not conducted, the methodology used to calculate the allocations was designed to ensure that the available funding was weighted towards the most rural populations and those experiencing most rural disadvantage. Using this methodology, which I am satisfied is fair and consistent, each county was allocated a proportionate share of the funding available through the LEADER elements of the RDP 2014-2020.</p><p>As the value of the LEADER element of 2014-2020 Programme is less than the LEADER element of the 2007-2013 Programme, the allocations made on a county basis under the new Programme, including the allocation for Carlow and Kilkenny, have inevitably reduced. Nevertheless, I am confident that through improved coordination and enhanced delivery structures at local level, the funding, while decreased, will be maximised to support the sustainable development of our rural communities , including those in Carlow and Kilkenny.</p><p>For the avoidance of any doubt, it should be noted that the allocations announced on 10 March 2015 were not allocations to current Local Development Companies. The allocations were made to counties on the basis that Local Development Strategies will emerge from these counties to support the delivery of the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme. My Department has no role in the internal operations of Local Development Companies and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of each company, as the employer, to manage. </p></reply>

The Building Regulations set out the minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings, including dwellings. Works carried out in accordance with the guidance in the TGDs is considered, prima facie, evidence of compliance with the Building Regulations.

In particular, the regulations require that a building shall be so designed and constructed that there are adequate means of escape in case of fire from the building to a place of safety outside the building which is capable of being safely and effectively used.  Furthermore, detailed guidance is provided in TGD B in respect of both the structure and the internal linings for the purpose of inhibiting the spread of fire within a building.</p><p>More specifically, the regulations require that a wall common to two or more buildings shall be so designed and constructed that it offers adequate resistance to the spread of fire between those buildings.  In this regard, each house in a terrace is to be treated as a separate building. Part B also requires that the external walls and roof of a building shall be so designed and constructed that they afford adequate resistance to the spread of fire to and from neighbouring buildings.</p><p>In the case of timber-frame dwellings specifically, the prefabricated structure should be designed and constructed in accordance with <i>I.S. 440:2009/A1:2014 Timber frame construction, dwellings and other buildings</i>which requires the floors and wall linings to be designed and detailed to provide the required level of fire resistance in accordance with Part B of the Building Regulations.  Detailed requirements for the fire-stopping of separating walls and for any voids / cavities therein are also specified in the standard.</p><p>Under the Building Control Acts, it is the responsibility of the owners and developers of buildings (including local authorities) to ensure compliance with all relevant parts of the Building Regulations, including fire safety requirements.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I issued a Direction to the four Dublin local authorities on 27 January 2015 to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households. This Direction applies for six months, from 27 January 2015 to 26 July 2015. </p><p>Under this Direction each of the Dublin housing authorities must ensure that at least 50% of the dwellings available for allocation under Section 22 of the 2009 Act during the specified period will be allocated to households that are qualified for social housing support (i.e. those who are on the record of qualified households) and that, on or before 1 December 2014, have been deemed by the authority to have one or more than one of the following needs:</p><p>(i) was in an institution, emergency accommodation or a hostel (i.e. a homeless household within the meaning of Section 2 of the Housing Act 1988);</p><p>(ii) has an accommodation requirement arising from an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment (i.e. households where one of its members has a disability and as such is deemed to be a vulnerable household); and</p><p>(iii) was in accommodation that was unsuitable for the household's adequate housing on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds (i.e. including households the subject of domestic violence and young people leaving State care and as such deemed to be a vulnerable household).</p><p>A copy of this Direction is available on my Department's website at:</p><p>Emergency accommodation funded under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 is not classified as a form of social housing support, and the fact that a person is in such accommodation does not affect his or her homeless status on the housing waiting list.  A household may apply for social housing to only one housing authority but on qualification for support, may be entered on the waiting lists of a maximum of three authorities in the city and council concerned. </p></reply>

HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October.  Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.  As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.</p>  <p>  I issued a statutory direction to the authorities involved in the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot, including those involved in the HAP pilot with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.</p></reply>

The current rate of 2.75% is approximately 1.5% lower than standard variable mortgage rate (saving borrowers &euro;1,500 per annum on a &euro;100,000 loan) and is the lowest rate available currently in the domestic mortgage market.  The Housing Finance Agency (HFA) provides loan finance to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies for housing and related purposes. The interest rates the Agency must pay are not predicated on base rates afforded by the European Central Bank (ECB) as its funding is sourced through a variety of market sources, including the European Investment Bank. Independently of the ECB rate cuts, the Agency has reduced the rate it charges to local authorities by 0.8% since September 2012.  This has allowed for the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) premium to begin to accumulate reserves. Such financial resources are necessary to ensure that local authorities can continue to offer the range of restructuring options to local authority borrowers in arrears that are included in the MARP. </p><p>My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014. <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The 2004 Act provides that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and may only be reviewed upward or downward once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and can make an application for dispute resolution to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement. The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits, and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination.  In May 2013, the PRTB launched a national rent index available at .  Compiled by the ESRI and based on the PRTB&rsquo;s own register of over 300,000 tenancies, this valuable source of information indicates the actual rents being paid for rented properties throughout the State.  The rent index is updated quarterly and shows the percentage change in rents over the previous quarter and over the previous twelve months.</p><p>Section 86(1) of the 2004 Act provides that pending the determination of a dispute that has been referred to the Board, the rent payable under the tenancy continues to be payable and, if the dispute relates to the amount of rent payable, no increase in the amount of the rent may be made.  This does not apply if, where awaiting the outcome of the dispute case, the parties agree to payment of the rent being suspended or if they agree to an increase in the amount of the rent being made. Subject to section 86(2), section 86(1) also provides that a termination of the tenancy concerned may not be effected pending the determination of a dispute. </p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act.  </p><p>A landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances set out in the Act, such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 112 days are provided for under section 66 of the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the PRTB for resolution.</p><p>According to the PRTB Annual Report for 2013, adjudication processing times were an average of 7 months in 2013 compared to 12 months in 2012.For 2014, I understand adjudications were taking an average of 5 to 6 months to process.  Late 2013 also saw the introduction of a pilot telephone mediation service as an alternative means to address disputes.  Processing times for mediation cases are typically 10 to 12 weeks.</p><p>Having regard to the quasi-judicial nature of the work of the PRTB, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any individual case.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. </p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SME&rsquo;s were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes.</p>  <p>  A monitoring services panel has also been advertised via eTenders on 6 November 2014.  This process will engage a panel of quality checked monitoring suppliers who will outline the costs they charge and the service they provide.  This information will be provided to the community groups and individuals to ensure they can make the best choice in relation to their monitoring services supplier.  The use of this panel is voluntary; the older person will be responsible for choosing the monitoring supplier of their choice, either from the panel or outside the panel.      </p>  <p>  The renewed scheme will focus on broadening the social inclusion element of the scheme by reducing the administrative burden of procurement on the local community organisations therefore enabling them to focus their resources on more engagement with the older people.  This will facilitate increased community support and the social inclusion of vulnerable older people in our communities.</p>  <p>  While Pobal will manage the Scheme on behalf of my Department, the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility. My Department will also have an oversight role in relation to Pobal&rsquo;s delivery of the Scheme, and will ensure that the valuable community support for elderly persons provided by the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups across the country will be maintained. </p></reply>

NAMA has made significant numbers of housing units available through the Housing Agency to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing.  This includes units provided through the NAMA special purpose vehicle, the National Asset Residential Property Services . Information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county, of units delivered on a quarterly basis, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at .  Since the process began in December 2011 up to the end of December 2014, 1,068 NAMA-sourced units have been delivered nationally through all delivery mechanisms. A further 686 property transactions are under active consideration whereby either terms are agreed, negotiation is on-going between the parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal (i.e. determining the most likely delivery mechanism) is being carried out.</p><p>In the Dublin City Council area 813 units have been identified of which 409 have had demand confirmed and 336 have completed.  I am satisfied that NAMA has facilitated the delivery of social housing to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies through the existing residential stock securing its loans and it has clearly signalled its commitment to doing likewise through its funding for new residential development.  I am confident that significant social housing units will continue to be delivered through this process.</p></reply>

Where an approved housing body retains 25% of tenancy nomination rights, funding for the approved cost of the development is up to 95%.  In the latter cases, the 25% of tenancy allocations are made at the discretion of the approved housing bodies.  This can allow flexibility within a housing project in order to accommodate those persons who may not qualify for the local authority waiting list but would be in need of housing.</p><p>Full details in relation to the Capital Assistance Scheme, including the lettings policy, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p></reply>

The Ex-post evaluation of the TELLUIS border project by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) (published on my Department&rsquo;s web site at ) concluded the project was fundamentally sound, was well scoped and planned, and &ldquo;engaged with stakeholders/the wider community through an exemplary communications campaign&rdquo;. </p><p>In extending the programme to other parts of the country, it is recognised that sustaining communications effort is fundamental in conducting the airborne programme in particular, and external public relations support is required to inform, in advance, land and animal owners of the flights.

While the North South Transmission Line project (N/S) is outside of the IEP's Terms of Reference, the IEP did agree, on foot of a request by my predecessor, to provide an opinion on the compatibility of the methodologies to be employed on the GL and GW projects with what has already been done on the N/S project up to and including 2 May 2014, being the date that the Panel decided to examine the N/S project.</p>  <p>  Having considered and discussed all of the material, the Panel issued a statement on 1 July 2014, indicating its unanimous opinion that, in all material respects, what had already been done on the N/S project is compatible with the methodologies now being employed on the GW and GL projects.  While the Panel acknowledged that no two grid infrastructure projects are identical, and that some non-comparabilities are likely to arise when assessing the potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors, the Panel was of the opinion that no material differences in the methodologies arise. </p>  <p>  EirGrid has advised my Department that on 13 March 2015 it submitted a draft application file for the N/S project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In that draft application two overhead towers and a section of 400 kV overhead line are proposed to be located in the townland in county Cavan referred to in the Question. My Department has been further advised by EirGrid that the proposal in respect of that townland is likely to remain unchanged in EirGrid's final application.</p>  <p>  A further consultative process will be open to interested parties following submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the final application. Section 182A of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended) provides for the making of submissions in relation to an application for consent with respect to a development comprising electricity transmission infrastructure. A timeframe of not less than six week of public consultation is provided for under the section.</p>  <p>  I am advised that submission of the final application is expected in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.</p>  <p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be met as a prerequisite. The policy framework provides that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs. This is designed to obviate against uneconomic projects which would increase costs for all gas consumers. The policy framework allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.</p>  <p>  Under the 2006 network connections policy, which included a review of the feasibility of connecting towns to the natural gas network in Galway/Mayo, the CER made the decision to allow the network to be extended to eleven of these towns, including Athenry. Prior to the roll out of gas to each town, a detailed analysis of the loads within the town and the revenues associated with them is carried out. There is also a requirement to secure a certain level of customers prior to the development commencing. The gas network has been extended to eight of these towns. Work is ongoing to secure economic loads in the three remaining towns, i.e. Athenry, Knock and Balyhaunis, prior to the commencement of construction. To date, the projected loads are insufficient to justify commencement of construction. </p>  <p>  Gaslink continues to keep under review the towns which did not qualify for connection under that study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis. The key factor which would qualify a town, or group of towns, in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.</p>  <p>  The CER recently organised a consultation on a Gaslink submission to it on revisions to the existing network connections policy, as mentioned above. The CER is currently reviewing the submissions received during the consultation period which closed on 13 March 2015.</p></reply>

In pursuit of these objects, which include the need to establish and maintain non-linear or &lsquo;online&rsquo; audio-visual services, the broadcasters are charged, inter-alia, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and &ldquo;have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular the Irish language&rdquo;. RT&Eacute; and TG4 publish detailed commitments on an annual basis setting out how they intend to meet their public service obligations and objects as set out in the Act. The extent to which the commitments entered into by the two public service broadcasters have been met is reviewed annually by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which provides an iterative approach that is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the changing needs of Irish society continue to be addressed.  RT&Eacute; is also obliged to make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. Section 116(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 fixes the formula for determining the minimum amount to be paid into the Independent Programme Account each year by RT&Eacute;. While considerable cost reduction measures have forced RT&Eacute; to reduce its expenditure on commissioned programmes in recent years, the value of programmes from the independent sector commissioned by RT&Eacute; remains significant with over &euro;39 million spent in 2014. </p>  <p>  Section 118(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 outlines the objects of TG4 and section 118(3) provides that TG4 shall ensure that its programme schedules are primarily in the Irish language. In addition, section 120 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; shall provide to TG4 programme material in the Irish language that will be the equivalent of one hour of daily programming throughout the calendar year. </p>  <p>  In relation to radio and television services other than those provided by the national public service broadcasters, these are matters for the BAI, which is an independent statutory body. </p>  <p>  In this regard, section 25 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that the BAI and its statutory committees, in performing their functions, shall endeavour to ensure that the number and categories of broadcasting services made available in the State best serve the needs of the Irish people bearing in mind their languages and traditions and their cultural diversity. The Contract Awards Committee makes arrangements to invite, consider and recommend to the Authority proposals for the provision of broadcasting services additional to the existing broadcasting services provided. </p>  <p>  Commitments in relation to broadcast content on commercial and community broadcast services are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and the relevant broadcasters. In submitting their licensing applications to the BAI, such broadcasters put forward commitments in regard to how they will deal with a range of broadcast issues including any public service commitments and, where appropriate, more specific commitments. If they are successful in their licence applications, these commitments form part of the terms and conditions of the relevant broadcaster's actual licence. This policy approach is seen as an effective means of leveraging public service type commitments from commercial broadcasters, in particular, while taking full account of the specific broadcaster&rsquo;s business proposal. </p>  <p>  The provision of non-linear or &lsquo;online&rsquo; services by commercial and community broadcasters is a matter for the broadcasters concerned.</p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Act, the BAI is also assigned responsibility for the development and administration of funding schemes designed to support the production and transmission of high quality programming based on Irish culture and heritage to be funded from the allocation of 7% of the net television licence fee receipts. The current scheme, Sound &amp;amp; Vision III, which specifically provides for the development of programmes in the Irish language, was launched in February 2015 and will see up to &euro;24 million in funding being made available to television and radio programmes through five funding rounds to be rolled out over the next two years.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, accommodation and staffing are amongst the most significant cost components of public sector bodies and it is incumbent on all agencies to achieve economy and efficiency. In this context, the Board of IFI continues to engage in a strategic rationalisation of its Dublin based accommodation into one location.    On its establishment, IFI had accommodation at three locations in Swords including leasing a headquarters building (this included IFI&rsquo;s research and development operations), a laboratory and a warehouse. In addition IFI had premises in Glasnevin and Blackrock. As part of this rationalisation, and in keeping with Government policy to exit from expensive leases wherever possible, IFI exercised the break clause on the Swords Headquarters when it arose and has already disposed of the Glasnevin premises. </p>  <p>  The rationalisation and amalgamation strategy for all Dublin property will generate efficiencies and also savings over time in relation to lease rents and in terms of the significantly better energy efficiency of the new Headquarters facility in Citywest, which will also be consistent with Government commitments as regards reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption. </p>  <p>  IFI recently identified suitable premises near its HQ in Citywest to house its warehousing, laboratory and archiving facilities and purchase of this premises is under consideration. The cost of this facility will be met from IFI&rsquo;s own resources. This element of the project continues the policy of exiting from expensive long term leases and will complete the rationalisation of IFI&rsquo;s operations in Dublin. Aside from the strategic benefit of co-locating this facility with the new HQ, from a response capability perspective, further savings are anticipated both in financial terms and in staff time.</p>  <p>  I am informed that this rationalisation is being undertaken in conformity with Public Financial Procedures, including capital appraisal, and that IFI has engaged with all staff on these matters and are continuing to do so through the normal Industrial Relations channels.  </p></reply>

The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15-year period.  The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion.  Solar PV is not one of the qualifying technologies for this scheme.  Further information is available on my Department's website, .  The Green Paper on Energy Policy, <i>inter alia</i>, sought feedback on the role that alternative technologies, such as solar, could play in delivering our renewable energy ambitions.  Views received will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the White Paper on Energy which will be published in September. </p><p>Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU internal market for electricity, my Department will be considering the appropriateness of a new support scheme for renewable electricity from 2016 onwards.  A key component of this will be consideration of the available technologies, their cost-effectiveness and the level of support required.  The scheme would be subject to State Aid clearance and the initial public consultation on a new scheme will commence in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I am informed by the RSA that the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) is in a good position to deal with current demand.  Vehicle Inspectors now number 580, the highest ever in the history of the NCT.  Testing facilities have been extended at Mullingar, Blarney, Portlaoise and Naas.  In addition, longer opening hours, in the form of a third shift, are in place at Galway, Killarney, Enniscorthy and Ballina, providing testing from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.  The majority of test centres have late openings on three days per week until 10 p.m. and 12 centres have extended opening on four days per week.  Since last month, 24-hour testing is available at one test centre in Dublin and Cork.</p>  <p>  I understand from the RSA that any car owner should receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and that in order to meet this standard, in some cases, the NCTS holds requests on a waiting list until a suitable slot is found.  In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, to ensure owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their certificate expires, an NCT may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of test due date without affecting the expiry date.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a person's NCT date is imminent, it will be a matter for garda&iacute; to use their discretion.  However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p></reply>

Among the basic of those requirements is that roadworthiness testing be related to the age of the car.  The first test is required at four years, with a test every other year thereafter. </p>  <p>  The Directive also allows Member States to test cars more frequently than the minimum requirements.  In this regard, with effect from 1 June 2011, annual testing was introduced for cars aged 10 years and older.  There are no proposals to change the current basis on which these tests are conducted.</p></reply>

All villages, businesses and geographic areas within close proximity of the route are in essence part of the geography of the Wild Atlantic Way.  The purpose of the route is to give guidance to visitors as to what there is to see on our western coast, provide easy access to a range of experiences and so enable local businesses to take advantage of the benefits of the Way.  My advice to communities on and near to the Wild Atlantic Way is to focus on how to use the route to generate more tourism revenue and not to focus on specific details of the route.</p></reply>

When undergoing the National Car Test or Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test, all vehicles have their tyres inspected for tread depth, condition and the presence of 'E' marks.</p>  <p>  The RSA has provided a Guide to Tyre Safety on its website which advises consumers as to what to look out for if they are considering buying used tyres. </p>  <p>  It is an offence to use a vehicle with defective or worn tyres.  This offence currently carries a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 on summary conviction in the case of a first offence.  Legal provision also exists under section 54(d) the Road Traffic Act 2010 for making this a fixed charge offence which will attract 2 penalty points on the payment of a fixed charge and 4 points on conviction in Court.

It is classified as a &ldquo;protected species&rdquo; under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, as well as being listed in Annex V of the EU Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).</p><p>Under Article 17 of the Directive, Member States are obliged to report to the European Commission on the status of listed habitats and species every six years. Each species is assessed according to its range across Ireland, the population, the quality of its habitat and its future prospects.  The Irish Hare was given a favourable conservation status in the Report entitled <i>&ldquo;The Status of European Union Protected Habitats and Species in Ireland&rdquo;, </i>which was submitted to the Commission in 2013.  A copy of the report is available on the website of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service at .  </p><p>The Bull Island is monitored regularly by officers of my Department, but, despite these efforts and those of local landowners, the hare population has remained at very low levels for the past 20 years.  While it is a matter for the landowners on the island to consider if they wish to translocate hares there, such a proposal would require a license from my Department under the Wildlife Acts.  In that regard, it would be important that conditions on the island would be suitable for a reintroduction programme.</p></reply>

A particular criterion is that a site must be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning of &ldquo;<i>cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Royal Sites of Ireland&rdquo;, made up of Cashel, D&uacute;n Ailinne, the Rathcroghan Complex, the Tara Complex, Eamhan Macha and the Hill of Uisneach, is included in Ireland's current Tentative List.  Having a nomination progressed from the Tentative List to inscription by UNESCO on the World Heritage List is a very substantial undertaking that requires the development of a comprehensive management plan, full agreement with local interests, significant local authority actions and support and, finally, production of highly detailed nomination documents.</p><p>In the case of the &ldquo;The Royal Sites of Ireland&rdquo;, initial technical evaluation reports have been produced by the local authorities in relation to each of the sites involved with a view to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each component of the overall set.  My Department has arranged for an expert examination of the technical evaluations and, assuming a positive outcome from that process, the next steps will involve developing management plans for each site and the identification of core and buffer zones in each case.  There will be local consultation at every stage with a view ultimately to the creation of full nomination documents for submission to UNESCO for evaluation and approval.</p></reply>

Vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub is important as wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity and therefore a review of the current legislation was initiated to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced.</p>  <p>  Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 of the Acts and I announced, last year, a consultation process which provided that opportunity, with a deadline of 9 January 2015 for the receipt of submissions.

These rates were subsequently increased in 2004, following agreement with the farming organisations under the Partnership talks. In May 2010, the then Government announced the closure of the voluntary bog purchase scheme to new applicants. My Department is continuing to process applications in respect of special areas of conservation received before this date.  Over &euro;1 million has been paid to 56 individuals in respect of plots or turbary rights in Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation purchased by my Department. Table 1 below shows aggregate details of the total amount paid by the year in which the transaction took place. It is not considered appropriate to provide details of individual payments having regard to data protection requirements.</p><p>In May 2010, an interim compensation payment scheme was established. This provided interim funding to those who had been cutting turf on raised bog special areas of conservation nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999. 4 applicants from Cloonmoylan Bog each received a payment of &euro;1,000 in respect of 2010 during that year under this scheme. 2 further applicants from Cloonmoylan Bog each received a payment of &euro;1,000 in 2011 under this scheme in respect of 2010.</p><p>This scheme was replaced by the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, established in 2011. The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that: </p><p>-  The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;</p><p>-  The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;</p><p>-  The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;</p><p>-  The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and</p><p>-  No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.</p><p>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has applied to Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation since 2011 and 94 applications under the scheme for this site had been received and acknowledged by my Department up to the end of 2014. A total of 276 payments and 5 turf deliveries have been made in respect of the applications received. In addition, 51 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants who have signed and returned legal agreements under the scheme to my Department. </p><p>This equates to some 74 individual applicants having received payments and 2 individuals having received turf deliveries under the scheme thus far. </p><p>Table 2 below shows the number of applications received in respect of Cloonmoylan Bog broken down by year. Table 3 below shows the number of payments and turf deliveries made in respect of Cloonmoylan Bog broken down by year.</p><p>In five cases relating to Cloonmoylan Bog special area of conservation, compensation has been made available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to the land owner/turbary right holder and to one other who had been cutting turf on the same bog plot. Aggregate details of the amounts paid and turf delivered in tonnes in respect of year 1 (2011), year 2 (2012), year 3 (2013) and year 4 (2014) of the scheme are set out in Table 4 below.</p><p>I am advised that, at this stage, one applicant from this site has been informed by my Department that he does not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. In this case the area in respect of which the applicant had applied for compensation was not within the designated site. While it may be anticipated that there will be further instances where applicants will be informed that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria, current priority is being given to providing compensation to those who clearly appear to fulfil the criteria on the basis of the information they have provided. In addition, establishing ownership rights is particularly complex and my Department is working with owners of land and turbary right holders to assist them in this regard.</p><p>My Department has not to date sought repayment of any compensation paid to applicants from this site.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme - total amount paid by year in Cloonmoylan Bog in County Galway</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total Amount Paid</th></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>&euro;109,273.96</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>&euro;145,172.14</td></tr><tr><td>2001</td><td>&euro;5,565.21</td></tr><tr><td>2002</td><td>&euro;75,434.27</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>&euro;206,457.90</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>&euro;111,851.69</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>&euro;17,719.23</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>&euro;83,647.73</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;88,612.28</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;62,817.38</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;21,425.00</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;12,258.13</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;68,291.88</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Number of applications by year received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme in respect of Cloonmoylan Bog</b><b></b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Applications Received</td><td>33</td><td>40</td><td>11</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3 &ndash; Number of turf deliveries and payments made under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme for Cloonmoylan Bog </b><table><tr><th>Total Number of Applications Received</th><th>Turf Deliveries</th><th>Turf Deliveries</th><th>Turf Deliveries</th><th>Turf Deliveries</th><th>Payments<br /><br />(Total of 276)</th><th>Payments<br /><br />(Total of 276)</th><th>Payments<br /><br />(Total of 276)</th><th>Payments<br /><br />(Total of 276)</th><th>Legal Agreement Payments </th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Year 2011</td><td>Year 2012</td><td>Year 2013</td><td>Year 2014</td><td>Year<br /><br />2011</td><td>Year<br /><br />2012</td><td>Year 2013</td><td>Year 2014</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>94</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>95</td><td>88</td><td>90</td><td>51</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 4 &ndash; Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme &ndash; Cloonmoylan Bog</b></p><p><b>Compensation made to Land Owner or Turbary Right Holder Applicant and to others who had been cutting on the same bog plots from 2011 to 2014</b><table><tr><th>Number of payees</th><th>Paid<br /><br />for<br /><br />2011</th><th>Turf 2011 <br /><br />(tonnes)</th><th>Paid for 2012</th><th>Turf 2012<br /><br />(tonnes)</th><th>Paid for 2013</th><th>Turf 2013<br /><br />(tonnes)</th><th>Paid for 2014</th><th>Turf 2014<br /><br />(tonnes)</th><th>Legal Agreement  Payments </th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>&euro;13,500</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;12,000</td><td>15</td><td>&euro;12,144</td><td>20</td><td>&euro;12,168</td><td>20</td><td>&euro;1,000<br /><br />(2 cases)</td></tr></table></p></reply>
