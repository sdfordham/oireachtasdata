    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-12a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200071#WRA00800"><p>Following the Assembly election, I spoke on 5 March with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the Taoiseach spoke with Prime Minister May.  Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the intensive talks in Belfast.  These talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.  The discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.</p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved - including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.</p>  <p>  In regard to legacy issues, I have been closely involved in the ongoing discussions in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to seek a way forward for the early establishment of the Stormont House framework.  In the discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>  <p>  Also, as part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.</p>  <p>  As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably.  I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement which will provide for stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-12a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200071#WRA01200"><p>I wish to reiterate my ongoing concerns about conditions in Maghaberry Prison, Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Maghaberry Prison was identified by the Criminal Justice Inspector, Brendan McGuigan, in a 2015 report as needing work to make the prison safer and to improve conditions for staff.  Since publication of that report, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate has continued with a programme of announced, low impact, visits to the prison which find that the situation has stabilised and that some progress has been achieved.  More work remains to be done.  In making the desired progress in Maghaberry, the cooperation of both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and the prisoners themselves is required.  I would encourage all with influence to move forward in the right spirit.</p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Executive last summer agreed to implement the recommendation of the Fresh Start Paramilitary Panel that a review of the separated regime in Maghaberry be established.  I look forward to the review panel being appointed following agreement on the formation of a new Executive and to seeing their work completed.  I believe that the review opens up an opportunity to address genuine concerns regarding separation, including such issues as association on the landings and access to education.  My Department engaged fully in the Paramilitary Panel&rsquo;s consultation process.</p>  <p>  Complicating matters has been the sense of threat which prison officers and their families perceive.  The murders of two prison officers, Adrian Ismay last March and David Black in 2012, have set back relations, in addition to being a tragedy for their families and friends.</p>  <p>  Conditions in the prison form part of my regular discussions with political   interlocutors in the North.  I look forward to continuing that active engagement as and when a new Minister for Justice is in place in Northern Ireland.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has certain responsibilities around the separated regime and he is aware of my views.  In addition, my officials maintain regular contact with the Department of Justice in the North, the Prisoner Ombudsman, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, the International Committee of the Red Cross&rsquo;s Belfast office and other relevant agencies. </p></reply>

These arrangements are based on the provisions of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.</p>  <p>  The European Commission will be the Union negotiator.  Its team will be led by Michel Barnier and will include a representative of the rotating Presidency of the Council.  A representative of the President of the European Council will be present alongside the European Commission representatives at all negotiating sessions.  As is the case in all European Union negotiations, individual Member States will not be present at these sessions.</p>  <p>  The EU27 Member States will monitor progress and give guidance to the Commission through a dedicated Working Party, which in turn will report to Coreper, on which Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the European Union sits.  It is expected that the Working Party will meet at least once per week. </p>  <p>  This will ensure that the negotiations are carried out under the overall strategic and political guidance of the EU27 Member States through the European Council and the General Affairs Council, supported by a very high level of scrutiny at senior official and Ambassadorial levels.</p>  <p>  In line with the arrangements agreed by the 27 Heads of State and Government in December 2016 and following the notification by the UK Government on 29 March of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, the President of the European Council circulated draft EU negotiating guidelines to the 27 Member States.</p>  <p>  These draft guidelines will be discussed among the EU27 throughout the month of April, with a view to their adoption by the European Council on 29 April following a preparatory meeting of the General Affairs Council on 27 April.  On the basis of the guidelines adopted, negotiating directives will subsequently be prepared for adoption by the General Affairs Council in May.  The negotiating directives will provide a formal mandate for the European Commission negotiating team.  It will be open to the European Council and Council to update the guidelines and negotiating directives as necessary as the negotiations proceed. </p>  <p>  We welcome this balanced approach to the negotiations and will engage fully and intensively with a view to pursuing our national interests and priorities within this framework.  We are ready and we will negotiate firmly and fairly, from a position of strength as a member of the EU27 team. </p></reply>

Venezuela is facing grave and deteriorating political, economic, and social crises.</p>  <p>  While domestic and international pressure led to the rescinding last week of most of the rulings of the Supreme Court, it remains the case that the Court has declared the National Assembly as being in contempt of the constitution and ruled that legislation passed by the National Assembly is null and void.  This order which has been in place since August 2016 undermines the core democratic principle of the separation of powers.</p>  <p>   I reiterate the European Union&rsquo;s call for all parties in Venezuela to respect the country&rsquo;s constitution and the role of the National Assembly, as well as democratic principles and the rule of law. My EU counterparts and I discussed Venezuela at the recent Foreign Affairs Council and we agreed on the importance of a peaceful solution to the current crisis.  Critical to this is the establishment of a clear electoral calendar.  In this context I welcome the resolution passed unanimously by the Organisation of American States on 3 April urging action by the Venezuelan government to ensure the full restoration of democratic order and share the grave concern expressed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at restrictions on freedom of movement, association expression and peaceful protest in Venezuela.</p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the shortages of food and medicines being faced by the people of Venezuela, and the unacceptable level of violence used by Government authorities in recent days against protesters and in particular against democratically elected opposition Deputies attempting to reach the National Assembly building.</p>  <p>  The Government of Venezuela must restore the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions and work together with the National Assembly and other national actors to address the many serious challenges facing the country. </p></reply>

My EU counterparts and I also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States.</p>  <p> The conflict in Syria is causing untold suffering and displacement of civilians on the ground.  I and my EU counterparts made clear that the Syrian regime has the primary responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population, and called upon the regime and its allies, notably Russia, to undertake all efforts to ensure a full cessation of hostilities; the lifting of sieges; and full unhindered sustainable country-wide humanitarian access.  Ireland's humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Syria crisis reached &euro;76 million as of March 2017, and we pledged a further &euro;25 million at the recent conference on Syria which was held in Brussels on Wednesday 5 April.</p>  <p>  The severe humanitarian situation in Yemen is also of grave concern.  My EU colleagues and I reiterated our strong support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen to achieve a resumption of negotiations and called on all parties to urgently agree on a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by the UN as a first step towards the resumption of peace talks under UN leadership.  Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since the conflict began and will maintain our support in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Council also agreed on the urgent need for a political solution that would unite Libya under the Libyan Peace Agreement.</p>  <p>  I continued my extensive engagement with EU counterparts by having bilateral meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Austria respectively to discuss ongoing preparations for the upcoming Brexit negotiations and Ireland&rsquo;s priority issues, namely the economy, Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and our vision for the future of the EU.</p>  <p>  The question of support for Iraqi and Syrian nationals impacted by the conflict to come to Ireland is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The visit began in Milan on 15 March where I had a series of engagements to promote Irish business involving clients of Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  Growing our bilateral trade and investment relations with Italy and other EU partners is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s diversification strategy in response to Brexit.</p><p>The following day I travelled to Rome where I had a very productive meeting with Italy&rsquo;s foreign minister, Angelino Alfano.  The focus of our discussions was Brexit but we also discussed migration, the future of Europe and bilateral relations. I gave an interview to the leading Italian daily newspaper <i>La Repubblica</i>which subsequently appeared in print and online.  The main topic of the interview was Brexit and I was pleased to have an opportunity to again highlight Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns.  I also availed of the opportunity to emphasise positive developments in the economy.</p><p>I addressed a gathering of Irish Community at the Ambassador to Italy&rsquo;s residence and at the Irish Celtic Ball on Saturday night, 18 March.</p><p>On St Patrick&rsquo;s Day I paid an official visit to the Holy See. As part of the visit, I officially opened the new Chancery of the Irish Embassy to the Holy See.  The opening was attended by senior officials of the Holy See including Archbishop Paul Gallagher, Secretary for Relations with States.  I also had a separate meeting with Archbishop Gallagher and we had a constructive and engaging discussion on a range of issues of mutual interest, including recent developments in Northern Ireland, the future of Europe, Brexit, and the World Meeting of Families which is due to take place in Ireland in 2018.  We also discussed bilateral relations between Ireland and the Holy See. </p></reply>

Settlements are illegal, they actively undermine the prospects for a sustainable negotiated two-state solution, and the relentless expansion of settlements inherently involves injustice for Palestinians.  These actions gravely damage Israel&rsquo;s reputation, and are incompatible with its government&rsquo;s declarations of support for a negotiated, peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>  <p>  It is particularly troubling when, as in the case of this new settlement announcement, seizures of Palestinian land and breaches of international law are undertaken in what might be seen as a manoeuvre in Israeli domestic politics, to &lsquo;compensate&rsquo; settlers and nationalists for a political disappointment on some other front.</p>  <p>  The international community has very clearly expressed its similar views on settlements, most recently in Security Council Resolution 2334 adopted in December, and the Declaration of the Paris Conference, which I attended in January.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about settlements are raised with the Israeli authorities on every appropriate occasion, and are also clearly expressed at EU level and in other international fora.  They are very well aware of our views.</p>  <p>  The suggestion of sanctions is made regularly by the Deputy and others.  Sanctions are not a standard response to breaches of human rights: there are very many states around the world about whom we would have very serious human rights concerns.  Crucially, moreover, they can only be applied if there is general agreement to them.

In the Programme for Government we have set out our ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit.  I  have  consistently stated that  progress needs to be made in a sustainable and manageable way, which continues to strengthen Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the OECD published the official ODA figures for 2016.  I am pleased to report that Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to ODA in 2016, increased by some 12 % on the 2015 levels, to &euro;725 million.  This is the third consecutive year of growth in the ODA volumes, and is a very clear demonstration of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing resources to our Aid Programme as economic conditions allow.  The OECD also confirmed that we last year reversed the trend of a declining ODA/GNP percentage.  Ireland&rsquo;s percentage rose to 0.33% for 2016, up from 0.32% in 2015.</p>  <p>  The challenge now is to continue to make sustained, manageable progress in meeting our commitment towards moving towards the UN target, while ensuring our aid programme continues to focus relentlessly on the core objectives of eradicating global hunger, reducing extreme poverty and providing humanitarian assistance to some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. </p></reply>

The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for that full implementation in both letter and spirit.</p>  <p>  While this commitment is something which is very much part of the daily work of my own &ndash; and indeed many other Departments, there are two significant challenges which are specific priorities at the moment: the talks in Belfast and the impact of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I have already reported to the House on the talks process in Belfast, in which I am representing the Government, aimed at implementing outstanding commitments from previous Agreements and supporting the formation of a new power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have spoken before about the interlocking institutions being at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  The devolved institutions are the lifeblood within the Agreement and the Government will spare no effort in working to support their re-establishment.  I know that all members in this House share our objective in this regard.</p>  <p>  In the context of the two year Brexit process having been triggered, an effective Northern Ireland Executive is vital so that Northern Ireland can directly engage with the challenges arising from the UK withdrawal from the EU.  Devolution is also necessary for the operation of the North South institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Cooperation on our island has always been important but it is crucial in the context of Brexit.  The role of the North South Ministerial Council will be central in the months and years ahead and I look forward to the resumption of its work, immediately following formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the context of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union.  While there is no substitute for direct representation of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests by an Executive, the Government has of course sought to protect the interests of the island as whole in its extensive preparatory work on Brexit.</p>  <p>  On the basis of our continuing intensive political and diplomatic engagement with every EU Member State and the EU Institutions, I am greatly heartened by the solidarity and support that our EU partners have shown for the imperative of protecting the peace process on our island, founded on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government will continue to do all it can to ensure that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are recognised and understood in the EU-UK negotiations process and respected and upheld in the final outcome.</p></reply>

Daesh and other terrorist groups have attacked and murdered many communities and groups of people for their religious beliefs and/or way of life.  The only means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities across the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have for so long destabilised the region and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies.  Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the unrest in the Middle East and North Africa region.</p>  <p>  More generally, Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East.  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are.  We attach great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN Human Rights Council, during the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review of the human rights records of UN Member States, as well as at the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  The promotion of inclusive societies where the human rights of all individuals are respected is a core objective of our engagement on issues such as the promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.</p>  <p>  During our Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  These Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy.  They emphasise the universality of this right and acknowledge its centrality to safeguarding diversity.  In 2015 Ireland also pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland has made freedom of religion and belief a priority of our engagement at the UN General Assembly.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have condemned all forms of persecution, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief on a number of occasions, most recently on 24 September 2016 at the 71st Session of the UNGA.  Ireland has consistently supported resolutions on freedom of religion or belief at the UN Human Rights Council, including co-sponsorship of the Resolution at the most recent session of the HRC in March.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland frequently raises and will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians through its official bilateral contacts, stressing the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

To that end, a significant programme of engagements with EU partners began after the referendum some time ago and will continue.  To date, there have been over 400 engagements across government at either political or senior official level.  For my part, since the UK referendum, I have had in excess of 70 meetings or conversations, including with each of my EU counterparts.  In March alone, I met with the Foreign Ministers from Italy, Luxembourg, Germany and Denmark and, most recently, met with my Swedish and Austrian colleagues in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 3 April.</p>  <p>  It is clear that this extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign has been effective in ensuring understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues.  This is clearly reflected in the draft negotiation Guidelines circulated to the EU27 on 31 March, as well as in Prime Minister May&rsquo;s letter of notification and the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on Brexit, all of which contain strong a strong acknowledgement of our unique concerns, including in relation to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  As regards to Gibraltar, it should be recalled that it is part neither of the UK nor of the EU, but is a UK overseas territory.  Moreover, its constitutional status is disputed.  The situation is therefore completely different to that of Northern Ireland, the constitutional status of which, and how that status might change on the basis of the principle of consent, are set out definitively in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The text in the draft Guidelines is consistent with Irish Government policy that the status of Gibraltar is a bilateral issue between Spain and the UK.</p>  <p>  Moreover the draft Guidelines make reference to Gibraltar within the context of the framework for future EU-UK relationship, which itself will be the subject of a separate negotiation and agreement at a later stage.  In all likelihood, that agreement will require ratification by all EU27 Member States, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  This is entirely distinct and separate from the Irish Government&rsquo;s priority of ensuring that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement.</p></reply>

We have provided a total of &euro;76.5 million in humanitarian assistance for victims of the Syrian conflict since 2012 and a further &euro;5.75 million for Iraq.  Furthermore, through our contributions to the EU and to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland is making a strong contribution to the broader EU and UN humanitarian responses in the region.</p>  <p>  The number of people who have been forced to flee their homes as a result of these conflicts continues to grow.  When I visited Lebanon and Jordan last month I witnessed for myself the needs of people forced from their homes and the huge pressures being placed on host communities.  Ireland will continue to support refugees and host communities with our humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  At the conference co-chaired by the EU and the UN last week in Brussels, the international community pledged a total of $6 billion for critical humanitarian programmes to assist Syria and the region in 2017.  I promised that Ireland would provide at least &euro;25 million this year to support those affected by the Syria crisis.</p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation in Syria, Iraq and the wider region closely.  Providing safe havens within conflict zones is extremely difficult however, especially where civilian protection is not prioritised.  Safe havens require UN mandates and robustly-equipped peacekeeping personnel.  Unfortunately, political will is lacking in many conflicts today, including from some on the UN Security Council.  However, in other places, the UN is active and there are twice as many UN peacekeepers deployed today as 15 years ago.  Ireland continues to play a significant role in peacekeeping missions and we will continue to keep the issue of safe havens in different conflict situations under review.</p></reply>

This is the Government&rsquo;s objective, and we are working day-in and day-out to seek to secure that outcome.  I reiterated our position when I met my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, again last month.  In recent days I have also spoken again with EU High Representative Mogherini about the case and I also availed of the opportunity of my meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, who is a former Egyptian Foreign Minister, to enlist his assistance in trying to persuade the Egyptian authorities to release this man.</p>  <p>  The trial in which this person is accused was back in court on 5 April and officials from the Irish Embassy were present in court to observe proceedings.  Our Ambassador was not there because he was in Dublin that same day and I was meeting him for consultations on this case.  The hearing saw more witnesses called and cross-examined.  The trial is clearly moving forward and there are indications that an end to it may be in prospect.  At that hearing, lawyers representing our Irish citizen made a request for his release on health grounds and the presiding Judge undertook to examine the matter.  The same judge has previously ordered on a number of occasions that there should be medical evaluations of this man&rsquo;s health.  The next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 26 April.</p>  <p>  I am aware of calls for the Government to pursue other avenues in order to seek to secure this citizen&rsquo;s return to Ireland, including international legal action.  Our approach throughout this case has been based on a very thorough analysis of all the information, experience and expertise available to us, and has benefitted from extensive consultations with a range of partners and third countries who have had cases involving citizens in comparable situations.  While we continue to keep all options under review, it remains our view at this point that the best approach is to continue to work through political and diplomatic channels.  This approach holds out the best prospect of a positive resolution to this case at the earliest possible time.  Our approach is also informed by our concern not to take any action which would be likely to be detrimental for this citizen&rsquo;s interests.</p></reply>

The Information Note for Applicants which accompanied the call, stated that should a large number of applicants meet the minimum eligibility requirements, a smaller number would be interviewed.

The attack was simply barbaric, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families.  I condemn unreservedly the attack and those responsible.</p><p>The attack further underlines the need for accountability and a genuine political transition in Syria.  The search for a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict, and, as part of that, ensuring full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria, is an international priority for Ireland.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s response goes far beyond statements.  Ireland is a strong and consistent supporter of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whose Fact Finding Mission (FFM) was set up in 2014 to &ldquo;establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic&rdquo;.  We support their work financially with annual contributions amounting to nearly &euro;1million since 2014.  In addition, my Department has contributed &euro;200,000 specifically to the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria.</p><p>More broadly, Ireland also supports the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry established in August 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria.<font color="#4F4F4F"> </font>Furthermore, in December, Ireland and a group of likeminded countries successfully pressed for the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly to establish an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism to investigate and prosecute all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  My Department is currently considering how best Ireland can continue to support the work of the Mechanism.</p><p>Ireland also supports EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as repression continues.<font color="#4F4F4F"> </font>The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications.  In addition, over 200 persons and 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  Last month the EU added four high-ranking Syrian military officials to the sanctions list for their role in the use of chemical weapons against civilians.</p><p>Ireland has also supported calls for sanctions at UN level also and very much regrets that a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have established a sanctions regime, a committee and an expert panel to hold accountable those using and producing chemical weapons in Syria was not passed on 28 February.</p><p>Ireland is not currently a member of the Security Council but is a member of the cross-regional Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group at the UN, which has framed a Code of Conduct, now supported by 112 Member States, regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  Last week, we joined with our ACT partners in calling on all members of the Security Council to apply the Code by supporting timely and decisive action against the use of chemical weapons in Syria and not to vote against a credible draft resolution to that effect.  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to ensure a lasting peace and full accountability for war crimes in Syria.</p><p>The principles and values underlining this support are important motivating factors for Ireland&rsquo;s candidature for election to the Security Council for the 2021-2022 term when we hope to bring Ireland&rsquo;s voice to the Council&rsquo;s table.</p></reply>

Its share of the off-budget 2014-2020 European Development Fund is 14.68% or &euro;4.48 billion out of a total of &euro;30.5 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s share is 0.94% or &euro;287 million. Provisional figures for member States&rsquo; shares of 2016 Official Development Assistance (ODA) spending from the EU Budget attribute 13.45% to the UK, or &euro;1.23 billion out of a total of &euro;9.13 billion, with Ireland at 1.61% or &euro;147 million.  The absence of the full UK contribution would necessarily result in either a significant reduction of the EU&rsquo;s aid budgets or an increase in the contributions of the remaining member States.</p>  <p>  In addition to the impact on levels of funding, if the UK were absent from policy debate, there would be a significant impact in terms of our shared policy objectives in EU discussions.  These include the continuing commitment to ODA, a focus on countries most in need, including a strong focus on Africa, and prioritisation of food and nutrition security, health, gender and work in fragile states.</p>  <p>  For now, of course, the UK is participating fully in EU development funding and policy discussions.  I look forward to continuing to work closely with the UK on development issues and to strengthening our cooperation and discussions with the other EU Member States.  Ireland will continue to play a strong role on development and humanitarian issues, at all levels internationally. </p>  <p>  The issue of tax transparency and financial regulation in the event of any move to Ireland by international financial sector companies is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-12a.85.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200073#WRC01000"><p>The triggering of Article 50 on 29 March represented the formal commencement of a process for which Ireland has been preparing intensively and extensively over the last nine months. Indeed, our analysis and contingency planning have been under way ever since late 2014. This has included comprehensive analysis involving all Government Departments of the implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU on a range of sectors and policy areas. There has also been extensive consultation, including through the all-island Civic Dialogue, and with a range of stakeholders. This work has been led by the Cabinet Committee on Brexit, chaired by the Taoiseach and involving all relevant Ministers, including myself.</p>  <p>  Arising from this extensive work, which continues, four headline challenges have been identified and prioritised by the Government as major political issues that will need to be addressed in the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and with regard to the EU-UK future relationship.  These are: to protect our economic interests and minimise the impact on our economy and trade; to protect the Northern Ireland Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement, including the need to maintain the invisible border on the island of Ireland; to maintain the Common Travel Area with the UK; and to secure Ireland&rsquo;s future in a strong European Union.</p>  <p>  I do not think it is helpful in a negotiation such as this to talk of red lines.  That said, it is vital that all efforts are made to avoid anything which might undermine stability in Northern Ireland, and relations between North and South. This is an objective that is not only in the interests of Ireland and the UK, but of the EU as a whole.  It is the Government&rsquo;s priority to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is fully respected and that the overall integrity of settlement is not disturbed. The open border that exists between North and South has been one of the central achievements of the peace process. We are pleased that the EU&rsquo;s draft negotiating guidelines, as circulated by President Tusk on 31 March and to be considered by the European Council on 29 April, make reference to the importance of protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland and to avoiding a &ldquo;hard border&rdquo; on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area is also an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for our people and well-being of our two countries. It is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and the UK Governments. I therefore welcome both Prime Minister May&rsquo;s reaffirmation in the Article 50 notification letter of the UK&rsquo;s intention to maintain the Common Travel Area after the UK withdraws from the EU, and the recognition in the draft European Council guidelines of existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the UK.</p>  <p>  Throughout the Article 50 negotiations and the subsequent negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, we will be working hard to ensure that key sectors of the economy, as well as our overall trading relationship with the UK, are protected to the greatest extent possible. For this reason, we have, within the context of the Article 50 negotiations, argued strongly for transitional arrangements to ensure certainty and continuity for our people and businesses in the period between the finalisation of the withdrawal agreement and the conclusion of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  I am therefore satisfied with the phased approach to negotiations that has been set out in the draft European Council guidelines. This seeks to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK and includes the possibility of a transitional arrangement with the objective of providing certainty and minimising economic disruption.</p>  <p>  Before discussions on the future relationship begin, following the achievement of sufficient progress in the Article 50 negotiations proper, the European Council will adopt additional guidelines on the Union&rsquo;s approach.  Ireland will be supporting the closest possible partnership between the Union and the UK, taking account of the need for a level playing field and the fact that the UK outside the Union will not have the same full set of rights and responsibilities as before.</p>  <p>  The strong acknowledgement of Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances in the draft EU negotiating guidelines, the UK Government&rsquo;s letter of notification and the resolution on the Brexit negotiations that was adopted by the European Parliament on 5 April is clear evidence that the extensive political, diplomatic and official campaign of recent months has been effective in ensuring understanding and recognition of our unique circumstances and specific issues. It reinforces our strong view that these will be resolved satisfactorily.</p>  <p>  The Government will produce a position paper on the Article 50 negotiations in advance of the meeting of the European Council on 29 April.  This will provide more detail on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, as governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This paper will build on the four priorities and will make clear that Ireland is ready for these negotiations in which the Government will be focused on getting the best deal for Ireland.</p></reply>

The UN has called on the international community to step up efforts to avoid catastrophe.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland provided some &euro;195 million in humanitarian assistance to people affected by crises worldwide.  Our assistance is focused on saving lives and alleviating suffering by providing food assistance, treating malnutrition, providing shelter and protection, and basic services in health care, education and water and sanitation. </p>  <p>  The continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance by the international community is essential.  Last month, Ireland provided &euro;11 million in support to our humanitarian partners in the Horn of Africa, bringing to &euro;115 million our humanitarian assistance to this region since 2012. This includes &euro;31 million to Somalia and &euro;21 million to Sudan. We are currently preparing a further package of humanitarian assistance to our NGO partners on the ground.  In addition, we are arranging two airlifts into the region in the coming days carrying 130 tonnes of emergency relief supplies, including blankets, shelter items and cooking sets.</p>  <p>  In view of the scale of the humanitarian crisis affecting Yemen, Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance since 2015, to our partners&rsquo; operations in the country.</p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor these crises closely and to provide life-saving assistance to people in need.</p></reply>

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the intensive talks in Belfast. These talks have two objectives. Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive. Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements. The discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.</p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding. Serious issues remain to be resolved - including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign. However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.</p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence. I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.</p>  <p>  As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably. I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement which will provide for stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The details supplied relate to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met. This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p><p>I should make the point that the Convention creates no new rights, but rather requires that people with disabilities be treated on an equal basis with others.  In particular, service standards and funding are subject to what the Convention describes as &lsquo;progressive realisation&rsquo; and are subject to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.  Issues around the allocation of resources are matters for each annual Budget and are for the individual Departments involved.</p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains an extremely high priority for me as Minister.</p></reply>

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities on the corresponding figure for 2015.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including use of a mobile phone.  Both strategic, targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road traffic enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.  </p>  <p>  Underpinning this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.</p></reply>

It has a broad scope involving a range of legislative and administrative actions to be implemented across a range of Government Departments and agencies.  Ireland is largely compliant with the Convention.  The additional actions necessary to ratify the Convention are set out in a multi-annual action Plan which was published when Ireland signed the Convention on 5 November 2015.  These actions are also contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, published in January, 2016. It is intended that they will be delivered by the first quarter of 2018.  The strategy is a whole of Government approach, involving seven Government Departments and a number of State bodies, including Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is committed to the ratification and full implementation of the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  Most of the strategy's actions are being delivered within current resource allocations.  To disaggregate the cost of Istanbul actions to date from overall budgets in the wide range of Departments and bodies involved would take a disproportionate amount of time. Additional funding, where required, will form part of the normal estimates process.  It is not possible at this time to determine projected cost.</p></reply>

There are already substantial resources deployed to addressing local policing and community safety issues and the JPCs are intended to enhance how these resources are deployed, not to supplement them.</p>  <p>  Each agency involved in the Committees is generally expected to meet the expenses arising for itself in establishing and operating the Committees from within its own budget.  As the Deputy is aware, the high proportion of resources allocated to the Garda Vote underlines this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the Government&rsquo;s decision to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This of course reflects the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government.  I am pleased that in Estimates 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  These investments will support all policing activities including community engagement and Garda participation on consultative fora, including Joint Policing Committees.</p></reply>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the Inspector of Prisons each have significant roles as statutory independent bodies charged with inspection of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prisons Service respectively.</p>  <p>  The possible establishment of an inspectorate with a remit covering the entire criminal justice sector is being considered by my Department, which published an initial discussion paper and hosted an open policy debate on the matter in November 2015.  A key area of focus at that debate and in subsequent deliberations was the possibility of such an inspectorate serving as a practical mechanism for implementation of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment (OPCAT).  My Department is further examining these and related issues, in consultation with relevant agencies and in conjunction with a review of the applicable legislative frameworks.  </p>  <p>  While the specific model in place in Northern Ireland is being examined in this context, there are a range of possible variants of (and alternatives to) such a model which also warrant consideration.

In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Committee website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.  </p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another. Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters. </p>  <p>  A Judicial Council Bill is included in the current legislative programme which provides for a range of matters including matters relating to developing schemes for judicial education and training.  It is envisaged that the Judicial Council, once established, will put in place a Sentencing Information Committee, a function of which will be to collate and disseminate information on sentencing in respect of criminal offences.  Any costs incurred in the operation of that Committee, which have yet to be determined, will be met from monies allocated in respect of the Judicial Council.</p></reply>

There are now 105 of these projects in place nationally and each project is managed by a Community Based Organisation (CBO) (e.g. For&oacute;ige, Youth Work Ireland, Crosscare etc).</p>  <p>  The GYDPs aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project.  The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the justice system.  Young people are normally referred to GYDPs by the local Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  The projects operate as a support to the statutory Garda Diversion Programme provided for in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 (as amended) and are funded by my Department, through the Irish Youth Justice Service.  In 2016, approximately &euro;15m was allocated by the Irish Youth Justice Service to GYDPs and a number of other youth diversion community based projects around the country.  A similar level of funding will be provided in 2017.</p>  <p>  With regards to introducing a Diversion Programme for young offenders aged 18-24 years the Deputy might note that the position in this regard, as outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question Nos. 9903/17 and 9905/17 on the 28 February 2017, remains the same. For this reason it is not possible at this point in time to provide a projected cost of introducing a Diversion Programme for this cohort.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 envisages a range of actions to be implemented by State, voluntary and community sector organisations aimed at preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB). </p><p>The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety. As part of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) are to be established in every Garda Division with specially trained staff.  These PSUs  are to ensure a consistent approach to domestic abuse and sexual crime, which will be supported by the national Bureau. The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.</p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that these Divisional PSUs are being rolled-out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves the establishment of three Units over a 12-month period on a pilot basis.  The pilot Divisions that have been identified are the Dublin Metropolitan Region West, Cork City, and the Louth Division.  The assessment of this pilot phase will inform the further roll-out to each Garda Division.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 28 February  2017, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 29 members and 9 civilians assigned to the GNPSB. As the GNPSB was only formed in 2015 when a number of Garda units were brought together it is only possible to provide figures for 2015 and 2016.

A national awareness campaign on domestic and sexual violence is a key action under the prevention pillar of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021.</p><p>It is intended that the &ldquo;<i>What would you do?</i>&rdquo; campaign which was launched in November 2016, will run for a period of 6 years up to 2021.  The first 3 years will focus on domestic violence to be followed by 3 years dealing with sexual violence but elements of each will be interwoven into each phase of the campaign.</p><p>The overall aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of domestic and sexual violence, to bring about  a change in long established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  I believe that these are achievable goals.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What would you do?</i>&rdquo; is designed to be a high impact media campaign to reach a national audience that features TV, cinema, radio, outdoor, social and digital advertising.  The campaign recognises that women and men are victims of domestic and sexual violence. The campaign aims to reduce the very real suffering of those affected through the actions and assistance of bystanders who have been moved to take action by this powerful campaign  and the call to action directs people to search the comprehensive campaign website whatwouldyoudo.ie for information and advice on domestic violence.  </p><p>In order to run the campaign, I secured funding of &euro;950,000 for 2016 and also for 2017.  In addition &euro;200,000 has been awarded under the Dormant Accounts Fund for the years 2016-2017 to deliver the message of the national campaign at a local level through media partnerships with service providers across the country.  The actual expenditure in 2016 was &euro;1,019,848  (including an allocation from the Dormant Accounts Fund).  The balance of the Dormant Accounts Fund award is budgeted to be spent with the &euro;950,000 allocated for 2017. </p><p>The creative and media agencies TBWA\Dublin and PHD Media Ireland were selected through a rigorous EU wide tender process to work with Cosc - the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence to develop and implement the campaign.</p></reply>

The organisations represented on the group are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board, the Probation Service, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, the Central Mental Hospital, and the Criminal Law Reform Division, Victims of Crime Office and Crime Division of my Department.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Victims Directive is being delivered within current resource allocations.  To disaggregate the cost of the Directive  actions to date from overall budgets in the wide range of Departments and bodies involved would take a disproportionate amount of time. Additional funding, where required, will form part of the normal estimates process.  It is not possible at this time to determine the projected cost.</p>  <p>  I have secured a &euro;250,000 increase in the funding for 2017 for the victims organisations funded through the Victims of Crime Office in my Department, bringing the total allocation for this year to &euro;1.712m.  This funding has been allocated and should help fund improved and expanded services by organisations  working with victims. This is in addition to an extra &euro;250,000 that I secured for 2016.  Services to victims that received funding in 2017 include helpline services, face to face emotional support, information and court accompaniment to victims and specialist services for those bereaved by homicide, tourist victims, child victims and victims of sexual crime and victims of domestic violence.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice Act 2006, which amended the Children Act, effectively raised the age of criminal responsibility from 7 years of age to 12 years of age and provided in general that children under the age of 12 years may not be charged with an offence. </p><p>  While 10 and 11 year-olds can be charged with serious offences, the Children Act provides that no prosecutions of any child under the age of 14 years may take place without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There is a further safeguard in the legislation whereby the court has the power to dismiss a case against a child under 14 years of age if &quot;having due regard to the child's age and level of maturity, it determines that the child did not have a full understanding of what was involved in the commission of the offence&quot;.</p><p>  While there are currently no plans to amend the provisions in the Children Act 2001 (as amended) relating to the age of criminal responsibility, the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018 includes an action to review generally the operation of the Act.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner is currently undertaking a review of the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme, the outcome of which may have implications for the current legal framework.</p></reply>

The Disciplinary Tribunal, whose members will be appointed by the President of the High Court on the nomination of the Minister for Justice and Equality, will have thirty-three members.  One of those nominated will also be appointed Chairperson of the Tribunal by the President of the High Court. Its membership under section 75 of the 2015 Act will include at least six members from each of the two legal professions and a lay majority.  The Tribunal will sit in uneven divisions of at least three members with each division to be chaired by a lay member.  The Tribunal will be empowered to make its own regulations under section 79 of the 2015 Act in relation to the making of applications to it and the conduct of its proceedings.  Section 83 of the 2015 Act also sets out how, and by whom, findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal may be appealed to the High Court.  The Tribunal will, over time, replace both the existing Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal who will wind-down their existing caseloads. </p>  <p>  However, the functioning of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal is also contingent on the related public complaints and misconduct provisions also found in Part 6 of the 2015 Act and which will have to be brought into operation at the same time.  These are the procedures through which complaints about alleged professional misconduct by solicitors or barristers will be received, given preliminary assessment and processed including, as may be considered appropriate, by their referral for determination by the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal.  Once these new procedures are commenced, all complaints by members of the public relating to alleged misconduct by barristers or solicitors, including those that may end up before the Disciplinary Tribunal, will be made initially through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and its Complaints Committee rather than through the legal professional bodies or directly to a Tribunal as happens at present.</p>  <p>  In processing these complaints the Regulatory Authority will, therefore, also have to appoint the Complaints Committee.  This Committee, which will have 27 members, will sit in divisional committees of three or five members, each with a lay Chair, to consider complaints within its remit.  It will be appointed under the specified criteria of section 69 of the 2015 Act.  It should also be noted that under section 55 of the Act the Legal Services Regulatory Authority can make regulations regarding the making of complaints to it and the proceedings to be followed by it and the Complaints Committee in investigating complaints.  Under section 67 the Regulatory Authority will also issue guidelines for the possible alternative resolution of complaints by mediation or informal means. Extensive preparations have to be made by the Authority, therefore, by way of ensuring that the new public complaints and disciplinary architecture of the 2015 Act are set-up with the required membership, supporting staff, regulations and expertise in place to function in a legally robust manner upon commencement of the provisions concerned.</p>  <p>  The setting-up of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, whose establishment day was set by Order of the T&aacute;naiste for 1 October 2016, has been underway since July 2016 when Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority underway, particularly in terms of its nomination and appointment.  In December 2016 sections 118 to 120 of the 2015 Act were commenced to enable the conduct of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority within the statutory periods concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships, Multi-Disciplinary Practices and certain restrictions on the work of barristers.  The Authority, for which initial office accommodation has been provided by my Department along with the secondment of an officer at Assistant Principal level, also appointed an Interim Chief Executive on 1 January 2016 and has just last week publicly advertised for the recruitment of a long-term Chief Executive.  On 31 March 2016, the Regulatory Authority presented respective reports under sections 118 and 119 to me as Minister for Justice and Equality and these will soon be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the required manner.  On 6 April 2016 the Authority commenced its public consultations process under section 120 of the Act about certain restrictions on the work of barristers. </p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the working focus right now is on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions.  Current areas of focus include the introduction of a more transparent legal costs regime and the parallel transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators under Part 10 of the 2015 Act; the establishment of a Roll of Practising Barristers under Part 9; and the separate introduction by my Department of Pre-Action Protocols in medical negligence cases under Part 15.  Following these steps the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the Act which the Deputy has raised, including the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The Chairperson and members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Interim Chief Executive and my Department are working closely to ensure that we can successfully coordinate the identification of the necessary steps and commencements by the Department, and the delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various remaining provisions concerned.  While it remains the intention that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be in substantive regulatory mode later this year, the phased start-up of its various functions along the lines expressed will need careful project management and the identification over coming weeks, and in conjunction with the Authority, of more specific delivery dates for the respective functions involved. </p></reply>

A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Revisiting the decisions made to close Garda stations is also part of that commitment. </p><p>In this context, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  I understand that work is continuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify the 6 stations for inclusion in the pilot and that consultations have taken place with relevant stakeholders, including the Policing Authority.  I am sure that the Deputy would agree that a comprehensive and evidenced-based analysis should be carried out, taking account of all the relevant factors, before a final decision is made in respect of the stations to be reopened by the Commissioner.  I expect to receive a report from the Commissioner by the end of May in connection with the exercise.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>This  pilot will feed into the wider review being undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  I understand that the Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p><p>- the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p><p>- the views of local communities;</p><p>- the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p><p>- relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p><p>I am informed that the review should be completed within the first half of 2018 and I look forward to receiving the report from the Authority in due course.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring that, in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the overall Garda strength to 15,000, the specialist units that form Garda Special Crime Operations (formerly National Support Services) will be increased to the required strength as determined by the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that the Commissioner has recently held competitions to fill vacancies for members in Garda Special Crime Operations and the needs of each the specialist units will be considered by the Commissioner when assigning successful candidates from these competitions.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end, an increase of 500 from the end of 2016.  I expect that the specialist units will, like all policing activities, benefit as a result of these new resources coming on stream.</p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the strength of the specialist units which form Garda Special Crime Operations as of the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are available.  I am advised that for security and operational reasons the strength of other specialist units, namely: the Armed Response Units, Emergency Response Unit, Special Detective Unit and Security and Intelligence Section, cannot be provided.<table><tr><th>Strength of Garda Special Crime Operations 28 Feb 2017</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>Garda National Immigration Bureau</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly Garda Bureau of  Fraud Investigation)</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>Garda National Protective Services Bureau</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Garda National  Technical Bureau</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Criminal Assets Bureau</td><td>34</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, the Government decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court.  These judges filled the three existing vacancies in the Circuit Court at that time and so now there is only one vacancy in the Circuit Court following a recent retirement of a Circuit Court judge.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that while there was an increase in the number of prosecutions in the courts of non-summary serious crime offences in 2015, the data for 2016 is currently being compiled and the trends will be carefully examined at that point.</p>  <p>  The allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The Courts Service continue to work with the Presidents and the judiciary to support the efficient disposal of court cases and to ensure that waiting times are kept to a minimum and, where specific issues are identified, resources are targeted at areas of greatest need.</p></reply>

These include Post Release Supervision orders under the Sex offender Act 2001 or Part Suspended Sentence Supervision orders under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  In the management of these cases, the level of supervision in the community is determined by the level of risk indicated through the application of formal risk assessment instruments. </p>  <p>  In an effort to strengthen the overall  management of prolific offenders the Joint Agency Response to Crime initiative (J-ARC) was developed.  J-ARC cases are managed on an inter-agency basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.  J-ARC  is a strategic response to the management of  prioritised prolific offenders whereby a number of pilot initiatives have been developed to address their behaviour and reduce crime.  J-ARC is operating with four inter-agency initiatives in Dublin and this has been extended to three additional areas i.e. Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.</p>  <p>  J-ARC has been incorporated into the first Joint Strategy on Offender Management which has been agreed between the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, The Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service and is in operation since September 2016.  The Joint Strategy recognises that in order to protect the public and reduce victimisation in Irish society, a joined-up approach to the management of offenders is essential.  The Strategy sets out a range of agreed key objectives and supporting actions for the enhanced management of offenders, to be advanced on an inter-agency basis in the period 2016-2018.  It places particular emphasis on the management of high-volume offenders, sex offenders and perpetrators of domestic violence, combined with a strong focus on the rights and protection of crime victims.</p></reply>

The Government consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they have been facing in relation to organised crime.  As well as introducing strengthened legislation, the Deputy will recall that I secured Government approval for significant extra funding to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis.  There has also been a significant step-up in recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with a target of 15,000 Garda Members by 2021.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the DMR in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU.  Following a selection and training process, the Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the DMR is now fully operational and providing armed cover on a 24 hour basis.  All the necessary resources have been provided to equip the new ASU and steps have also been taken to upgrade the equipment available to the Emergency Response Unit and the Special Detective Unit.  I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that members were assigned to this unit from existing resources and further advised that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the ASU is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

The Central Bank recognises the important role of credit unions and the provision of credit union services to their members and engages with credit unions to address supervisory issues arising. </p>  <p>  The role of the Registry of Credit Unions is to regulate credit unions with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability and wellbeing of credit unions generally in line with its statutory mandate.  In general, lending restrictions are imposed in the context of on-going matters of supervisory concern arising in individual credit unions.  Where individual credit union lending restrictions are currently in place, they are reviewed on a regular basis by the Central Bank to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels. </p>  <p>  In relation to the holding of Annual General Meetings (AGM's) in accordance with Section 78(2) of the Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended), the Central Bank informs me that it works closely with credit unions on a case by case basis to resolve any regulatory issues arising before a credit union can hold its AGM. </p>  <p>  The regulation and supervision of the credit union sector is a matter for the Central Bank and I am satisfied that the Registrar of Credit Unions is working in the best interests of individual credit unions, their members and the sector as a whole. </p>  <p>  In relation to lending restrictions more generally, the Implementation Group which I have established to implement all recommendations in the Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) report is currently considering all recommendations including a full review of section 35 lending limits and concentration limits.  I look forward to an update from them in due course.</p></reply>

In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

My Department has received a number of such proposals from both the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and from the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA).  Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.  While the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing, any such proposal would require approval of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank before it could be implemented.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it has received information regarding proposals for credit unions to provide funding for social housing and is currently engaging with the sector on those proposals.  It further stated that while it does not comment on specific proposals, such investments could be facilitated by future regulations made by the Central Bank, where appropriate.  The Central Bank also stated that it is willing to consider the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals.  However, the Central Bank's key consideration in evaluating such proposals is its statutory mandate to ensure the protection of members' savings by credit unions and to ensure the wellbeing of the sector generally.</p>  <p>  Officials from both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government have met with the representative bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  Officials from both Departments have also met with the Central Bank.  Separately, communication is ongoing between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and my Department.</p>  <p>  On 1 January 2016, I commenced the final sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (2012 Act) following discussions with credit union representative bodies.  Following commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016, regarding a number of areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity. </p>  <p>  Investment regulations made specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank are currently reviewing the investment regulations for credit unions and on completion of their review will undertake a public consultation in 2017.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.</p>  <p>  In relation to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the  Central Bank has informed me that credit unions are permitted to provide commercial loans to their members.  Commercial loans are subject to concentration, maturity and large exposure limits as outlined in the 2016 Regulations.  In addition, where a credit union is considering granting a commercial loan, a comprehensive business plan and detailed financial projections (supported by evidence based assumptions), appropriate for the scale and complexity of the loan, should be provided and in place before such a loan is granted.  This should enable the credit union to ensure that it is satisfied that the borrowing business has the capacity to generate sufficient income to repay the commercial loan.  The Central Bank has further informed me that lending to SMEs is a specialist form of lending that requires specific skills and expertise.  In general, this type of lending is viewed as high risk which may not be appropriate for all credit unions. </p>  <p>  Currently credit unions can and some do provide mortgages to members.  These types of loans are subject to certain maturity limits contained in the 2016 Regulations.  The 2016 Regulations set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both five years and ten years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the 2016 Regulations credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  There are currently 11 credit unions approved to avail of increased longer term lending limits.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank informs me that the December 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall, total gross loans over 10 years amount to c. 2.7% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10% (and in some cases 15%).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that while it can see longer term lending, including mortgages, being part of a balanced portfolio of total lending, in their analyses, credit unions need to consider the impact of longer term lending on interest margins, return on assets and on balance sheet structure  the issue of funding longer term lending with short term funding is a challenge for the credit union business model.  The Central Bank further informs me that consumer mortgage lending is an activity that has its own unique risk profile, and proposals to become involved in mortgage lending in a significant way must be supported by an evidenced based business case. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee's (CUAC) recent report provides a number of recommendations, one of which is to conduct a full review of lending limits and concentration limits.  I have established an Implementation Group which is due to meet for the third time later this month.  The Implementation Group is currently assessing each of CUAC's recommendations with a view to implementation as appropriate.  Central to its work is ensuring a full examination of lending limits and concentration limits as recommended.  I look forward to regular progress reports from the Implementation Group as these recommendations are developed and implemented.</p></reply>

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out in an action plan within the Report.  The Report including the Action Plan is available on the Department's website at:</p><p><i> </i></p><p>The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, conducted its own review of the rising cost of motor insurance and published its report in November 2016.  I am of the view that considerable overlaps exist between the two reports.  Therefore in implementing the Cost of Insurance Report, the Government will address many of the recommendations contained in the Joint Committee's Report, including in such key areas as:</p><p>-  Consumer protection e.g., providing breakdown of the calculation/increase in premiums, improving conditions for returning emigrants, etc.</p><p>-  Enhancing transparency in the claims environment e.g., establishing a National Claims Information Database, improving the quality of data in the Book of Quantum, etc.</p><p>-  Counteracting uninsured driving and fraud e.g., establishing fully-functional databases in respect of uninsured drivers and insurance fraud, expediting the development of the Master Licence Record, etc.</p><p>In this respect, work is well underway by all relevant bodies and stakeholders in implementing the recommendations and it is expected that the Report's 71 actions will be completed by the end of 2018, with 45 due before the end of this year.  </p><p>My Department will publish its first quarterly progress report on the implementation of the recommendations in the coming weeks.  This report will provide a full update on the progress to date on the overall implementation of the Report, with a particular focus on action points due for completion in the first Quarter of 2017.  This update will cover actions such as the establishment of the  Personal Injuries Commission in January and the issuing of a key aggregated metrics template  to insurance undertakings for completion at the end of March.</p><p>In addition to the quarterly report, the Minister of State will continue to engage regularly with the Joint Committee to ensure that collaboration in working on these issues continues.  In this context, he has made a number of appearances before the Joint Committee, both during its work, and by way of providing an update on progress.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-12a.255.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041200077#WRG01400"><p>I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence of flood cover can cause to householders.  However, the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and then ensuring that they have adequate provisioning to meet those risks.</p>  <p>  Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to any specific individuals.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of and lower cost for flood insurance.  To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  -  prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,</p>  <p>  -  development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and</p>  <p>  -  improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.</p>  <p>  The National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme entailed a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk.  Under this Programme, 29 draft Flood Risk Management Plans were published for public consultation with feasible flood prevention measures identified to provide protection to at risk properties in 300 assessed areas.  These draft Plans are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks when submissions from the public consultation process have been fully considered.  The Government remains committed to funding this programme, as a core element of flood management strategy, over the next several years.</p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme with in the region of &euro;250 million spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  The Capital Programme covering the period 2016 to 2021 will see the current annual allocation for flood risk schemes increased from &euro;45 million to &euro;100 million by 2021, representing a total investment of &euro;430 million.  These works will be completed on a prioritised basis.</p>  <p>  This strategy is also complemented by the Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance companies in Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  A further meeting of this working group is scheduled this month.</p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while there has been an increase from 66% to 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences including flood cover.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.  In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions, which includes a submission from the board of management of the school in question, and formulating next steps. Clearly I will not make any decisions around next steps until such time as all of the submissions have been examined and considered.</p></reply>

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of education policy.</p><p>The key data sources used in the identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Identification Model, to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach which has been uniformly applied for all schools in the country. </p><p>Full details of the process involved in the assessment of schools is available on my Departments website at </p><p>The following programme of work will be carried out, in consultation with stakeholders:</p><p>-  The model will be further refined and, for both financial and logistical reasons, the following incremental phased approach to the deployment of resources will be implemented:</p><p>-  In early 2017 all schools across the primary and post primary sectors will be assessed in terms of their socio-economic demographic using the new Assessment Framework;</p><p>-  From September 2017, supports under the School Support Programme will be extended on a phased basis to those schools not already in receipt of these supports and who are identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils at greatest risk of educational disadvantage;</p><p>- Further analysis will be conducted to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.</p><p>Work will be carried out to consider designing a more tailored system of resource allocation, within which there are more grades of disadvantage identified and resources are allocated accordingly in response to the needs of individual schools;</p><p>A Monitoring and Evaluation Framework will be implemented, to improve transparency and to determine which interventions are having the greatest impact in terms of delivering better outcomes for learners;</p><p>A review will be carried out at the end of the 2017/2018 academic year to examine how the new model of allocating resources has operated;</p><p>The aim will be that, following this work, in 2018 the new model of resource allocation will be finalised, the objective of which will be to more closely match resources with identified needs in individual schools.</p><p>I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model including details of how the datasets are used to determine a schools level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for detailed and up to date information from schools.</p><p>In terms of the process to date, the position in relation to the new model is that, in its initial application, it has identified that there are schools not previously included in DEIS, whose level of concentrated disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.</p><p>It is important to note that this is a first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports.  As I have also previously stated I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.  </p><p>The implementation of the new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.  The completion of this work will inform ongoing provision and consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>As provided for in the DEIS Action Plan the Department has begun a process of verifying the data used to identify the levels of concentrated disadvantage for each school.  I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy has requested such verification.  When this process has been concluded all schools, who have requested such verification, will be notified directly by my Department of the outcome of this process. </p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers).  Improvements to the staffing of these schools were announced for the 2015/16 school year.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the staffing allocation for Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  The detailed arrangements will be set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017/18 school year. </p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the 2011/12 staffing schedule for small schools would be approximately &euro;7.5m. </p>  <p>  Proposals for Budget 2018 will be considered near Autumn of this year. </p></reply>

In this regard, I note that the Census 2016 figures indicate that those with no religion account for 9.8% of the population. </p>  <p>  In the Consultation paper I set out four possible approaches for dealing with the issue, in primary schools in the first instance, including:</p>  <p>  A catchment area approach, prohibiting religious schools from giving preference to children of their own religion who live outside the catchment area ahead of non-religious children who live inside the catchment;</p>  <p>  A &lsquo;nearest school rule&rsquo;, allowing religious schools to give preference to a religious child only where it is that child&rsquo;s nearest school of that particular religion;</p>  <p>  A quota system, which would allow a religious school give preference to children of its own religion in respect of only a certain proportion of places, meaning that the remaining places would be allocated based on other admissions criteria &ndash; proximity to the school, lottery etc.;</p>  <p>  An outright prohibition on religious schools using religion as a factor in admissions, meaning that all places would be allocated based on other factors.  Within this approach, there is capacity to allow religious schools to require parents or students to indicate some support or respect for the ethos of the school.</p>  <p>  I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences with each of these approaches, including possible impacts on minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  Other possible consequences to be avoided include possible breaches of the constitution, technical and administrative difficulties impacting on the capacity to effectively run the system of over 4000 schools and the possibility of creating &lsquo;postcode lotteries&rsquo;, such as other countries have experienced, resulting in pronounced divergence in the quality of schools in more advantaged compared to less advantaged areas. </p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions has now closed and this is part of the broader 12 week consultation process which will include additional steps, including any follow-up consultation that is required, collation of responses and development of next steps. </p>  <p>  My Department has begun the process of examining the submissions and formulating next steps.  Clearly I will not make any decisions around next steps until such time as all of the submissions have been examined and considered.</p></reply>

Some of the actions as part of the plan are to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by:</p><p>-  Restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit</p><p>-  Increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce or eliminate school book costs for parents</p><p>-  Issuing a new circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy and other costs and the need to put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs.</p><p>Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. </p><p>In relation to capitation funding and book rental schemes these remain a priority for me to address during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s position in relation to voluntary contributions is that they are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay.  I have no plans to alter this position so long as schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6 July 2016 and is shortly due to progress to Committee Stage, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</p><p>On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p><p>The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents, ensuring parents and students have a say in key decisions like school uniform costs, etc.</p><p>Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter. </p><p>The draft Bill has now gone to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Pre-legislative scrutiny began on 7 March with officials, NGOs and some of the education partners, followed by a second session on 21 March which was attended by other education partners.</p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

This was introduced at the start of the 2011/2012 academic year and the same charge has applied each year since then. </p>  <p>  Full medical card holders, in their own right as well as their dependent children, those eligible under the student grant scheme and those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) or Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) allowances are exempt from paying the contribution.  Approximately 60% of PLC learners in any given year are exempt from paying the charge.</p>  <p>  The PLC participant contribution is set against the amount to be paid in enhanced capitation grants to ETBs.  The estimated cost of removing the PLC participant charge is approximately &euro;3 million annually. </p>  <p>  In relation to Apprenticeship fees an Annual Student Contribution is levied on all students attending Institutes of Technology (IoTs).  Previously this Annual Student Contribution was paid by F&Aacute;S/SOLAS with apprentices themselves paying the part of the contribution relating to examination fees.  As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS ceased making payments to IoTs and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.</p>  <p>  The amount charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in IoTs during the academic year.  This cost would typically be one third of the Annual Student Contribution paid by students attending for the full academic year, currently &euro;3,000 and would amount to approx. &euro;1,000 per student per annum. </p>  <p>  The cost of not charging the Annual Student Contribution to apprentices in 2017 is estimated as &euro;3.8 million.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to abolish either the PLC participant charge or the Annual Student Contribution for apprentices.  </p></reply>

The scheme provides for the allocation of a quantum of SNA support to schools, taking into account the assessed care needs of individual children with disabilities, or severe medical needs.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates SNA support to schools, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.  </p><p>Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools, to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs, as and when support is needed.  Schools who wish to make applications for SNA support should apply to the NCSE.</p><p>There are 13,015 SNA posts available for allocation to schools to June 2017; this represents an increase of almost 23% or 2440 posts since 2011/12, when 10,575 posts were available.  Last year alone I secured an increase of almost 1000 additional SNAs. </p><p>The Irish Government Economic &amp;amp; Evaluation Service (IGEES) published a Focused Policy Assessment (FPA) of Data on Special Needs Assistants in August 2016 which is available at: .  This FPA forms part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to the Public Spending Code (PSC) and evidence informed policy making. </p><p>One of the objectives of the FPA was to identify what is required to develop the forecasting capacity of the Department and the NCSE in order to anticipate the level of demand and cost of future SNA requirements and that the provision of this data would be aligned with the planning needs of my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the NCSE with specific reference to the annual budgetary process.</p><p>Through analysing growth in metrics, such as the age profile of students accessing SNA supports, the growth in the numbers of students accessing SNAs as a proportion of the primary and post-primary education, and levels of enrolment in special classes, the FPA estimated that future demand of the number of additional SNAs likely to be required to 2019 will be in the order of between 1,300 and 5,400 posts, which is estimated to cost between &euro;47m and &euro;183m.  The report noted, however, that this is an indicative estimate and that it is unrealistic to assume that the report can predict exactly the quantum of future student demand of SNAs. </p><p>The extent of funding required to provide for SNA support in future years will, therefore, take into account the actual demand which transpires annually, while also taking into account the significant increases in SNA numbers already provided.</p><p>The FPA report recommended that the NCSE provide an End of Year Statement of Demand and a forecast of future demand in mid-April each year, with an updated forecast by mid-June to take account of trends arising during the current year&rsquo;s application process. </p><p>The SNA demand for 2017/18 school year will not be known until the NCSE application process is complete.  Demand over the next 5 years can not be accurately estimated until the NCSE provides its forecast of future demand for consideration in each of the next 5 years.  </p></reply>

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgment to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. Schools are supported in this regard by the NEPS.  </p><p>Schools are not required to apply directly to my Department for learning support for SLDs.  Schools should monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.</p><p>A new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile.  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school.  </p><p>Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools and 0014/2017 for post primary schools, which were published on 7 March 2017, set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  Allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7 March.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.  Schools will also receive guidance as to how they should deploy their resources to provide additional teaching support for pupils taking into account their individual learning needs. </p><p>Funding is also available to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, where relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education.  Schools apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013.  </p><p>Further supports which are provided to support pupils with Dyslexia include an information resource pack on Dyslexia which has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools as well as provision for continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs in the area of Dyslexia through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  The SESS manages, co-ordinates and develops a range of professional development and supports in response to identified teacher training needs.  During the current school year (2016/17), specific courses were aimed at mainstream primary and post-primary classroom teachers, Learning Support and Resource Teachers who work with pupils with identified or unidentified specific literacy difficulties including dyslexia.  These courses are designed to support teachers with appropriate and practical strategies to implement with their pupils across the school context.  60 teachers also availed of training this year in the Wilson Reading System which is a highly-specialised intensive programme on the development of reading for students with dyslexia. </p><p>My Department has provided funding to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland at national level which helps the organisation operate an information service for members and the public as well as assisting in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.</p><p>The total grant-aid provided by my Department to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland for the past 10 years, including funding provided to the Association for further education programmes, is as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Allocation &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>183,500</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>188,000</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>183,500</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>183,500</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>180,500</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>200,500</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>200,500</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>200,500</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>193,180</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>192,772</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Implementation of the programme of work under this Strategy is now underway, with a key priority being the broadband connectivity issues experienced by primary schools owing to infrastructural deficits and the dispersal of primary schools.  My Department is collaborating with the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment on this issue, having regard to the National Digital Strategy.  An interdepartmental working group will consider the options and make recommendations based on those deliberations to provide enhanced broadband services to primary schools.</p>  <p>  Currently at least 95% of schools are connected to the Department's Broadband Access Programme.  At primary level, the Department has upgraded more than 1,000 Primary school connections to fibre broadband in fibre broadband enabled areas.  Under the current programme, the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, within the parameters of the programme and in compliance with procurement and contractual obligations. </p>  <p>  All post-primary schools are provided with 100Mbp/s connectivity.  The 100Mb/s Post Primary project was a joint venture between the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (DCENR), now the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. DCCAE funded all of the capital costs of this project, as well as contributing to the recurring costs for the years 2013 to 2015.  My Department funded the remaining current costs and will also fund the on-going costs on an annual basis into the future. </p>  <p>  The total annual cost of the Schools Broadband Access Scheme for Primary and Post-Primary is some &euro;14m. </p>  <p>  The Strategy recognises the issues schools face in relation to ICT infrastructure, and funding of &euro;210m is committed to address these requirements over the period of the Strategy.  The first tranche of funding of &euro;30m in respect of the 2016-2017 school year has been issued to all eligible primary and post-primary schools.

Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p><p>The NCSE has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie. </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31 2017. </p><p>Schools may appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.</p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>As the NCSE are still processing these appeals, I have referred the Deputy's question in relation to details of the number of appeals received per County to the NCSE for their direct reply to the Deputy.</p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

Through RSE, formal opportunities are provided for students to acquire knowledge and understanding of human sexuality. </p>  <p>  While gender and orientation are not explicitly designated topics in the SPHE syllabuses, those syllabuses do provide opportunities for teachers to explore such issues at an age-appropriate level.  The topics included are intended to develop in students respect for one&rsquo;s own sexuality and the sexuality of others.   </p>  <p>  The SPHE Support Service has worked collaboratively with bodies including GLEN and BelongTo and the HSE to develop a resource, &ldquo;Growing up lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender&rdquo; for use by RSE classes at both junior and senior cycle levels. It includes lesson plans which will support students to achieve a better understanding of the concepts of gender identity and transgender.  The menu of in-service courses offered by the SPHE Support Service to schools also includes the topics of sexual orientation and homophobic bullying.</p>  <p>  In relation to primary curriculum provision, the SPHE course is designed to foster in the child a sense of care and respect for himself/herself and others, an understanding of his/her sexuality, and an appreciation of the dignity of every human being.  As children progress through an SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues.  These include substance misuse, relationships, sexuality, child abuse prevention, prejudice and discrimination.  The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information provided where necessary.</p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  These data are combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Educational performance is not included in the identification process.</p>  <p>  In terms of the process to date, as I have previously explained to the Deputy, the measure I took on 13th February last to extend DEIS supports to schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage represents a first step in implementing DEIS Plan 2017.</p>  <p>  The application of the new model has identified that some schools, currently included in DEIS, have a level of disadvantage within their school populations which is much lower than that identified in some schools not in the programme.  As noted in DEIS Plan 2017,  we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving additional resources, including resources that may be more fairly allocated to schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  As noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p>  <p>  The outcome of this further programme of work will inform future decision-making on resource allocation to all schools. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I aim to take a prudent approach to managing the future allocation of supports under DEIS, as provided for in DEIS Plan 2017.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Grant was to assist in the promotion of increased conservation and more sustainable use of water services.  The Grant was paid on a universal basis to principal primary residences, which were registered with Irish Water by 30 June 2015, whether the water was supplied by Irish Water, the group water sector or through other private sources, such as private wells.</p>  <p>  The Water Conservation Grant was introduced to support households in conserving water and adopting more sustainable approaches towards the use of water services in the home.  As part of the scheme&rsquo;s information campaign, my Department published literature that outlined several ways in which householders could conserve water through household devices and water-efficient appliances.  This information was also placed on the scheme&rsquo;s website, www.watergrant.ie, and on that of the Department.  The website has had over 16 million individual page hits since it was launched in 2015.  Information leaflets produced by my Department on water conservation were distributed through public and other relevant bodies, such as the EPA and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and at major public events, such as the National Ploughing Championships.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection, which administered the Grant on behalf of my Department, has made grant payments totalling just over &euro;89 million, in respect of 890,107 applications.  Administration costs of &euro;5,995,762 were incurred in respect of the Grant.  Therefore, the total cost of the Water Conservation Grant to the Exchequer to date is &euro;95,006,462.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in late 2017.</p></reply>

For this reason, the Central Statistics Office provides a number of projected scenarios associated with future population levels.  Factors such as economic conditions in Dublin and elsewhere, migration, fertility, and household formation rates will all have a bearing on actual observed population change and the consequent demand for housing.</p><p>What is certain is that supply of new homes must increase in Dublin and elsewhere.  My priority therefore, as Minister with responsibility for housing and planning, is to ensure that all reasonable steps are being taken to secure the required increase in housing supply to meet both current and future demand.</p><p>The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (July 2016), which is available at the following link, <i></i>, is focused on increasing supply across all tenures to achieve total housing output of at least 25,000 homes nationally per year by 2021 and beyond, effectively doubling the output of 12,600 homes recorded in 2015.  A significant proportion of these homes will need to be provided in the Greater Dublin Area, where demand pressures are greatest.</p><p>As well as the unprecedented increase in the Government&rsquo;s social housing investment programme to &euro;5.35 billion over the six-year period to 2021, this Action Plan includes measures to encourage, facilitate and incentivise the increase of housing supplied by the private sector for both purchase and rent.  Through Rebuilding Ireland, I am also working to ensure that housing is delivered much more quickly from key strategic sites in Dublin and the other cities in both public and private ownership, particularly off State-owned lands.</p><p>In that regard, a total of &euro;113 million funding of enabling infrastructure is being provided to the four Dublin local authorities under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to open up major housing sites to deliver an estimated 14,000 additional housing units up to 2021, with a long-term potential yield of over 37,000 as the sites are fully built out.  Further details on the Dublin sites funded can be found at <i></i>.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the four Dublin local authorities, through the governance arrangements under Rebuilding Ireland and, more specifically, through the Dublin Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce.  This Task Force, which comprises representatives from my Department, the Chief Executives of the four Dublin local authorities, NAMA and other key agencies, was established to address supply-related issues regarding the delivery of homes in the Dublin region.</p><p>In Quarter 4 2016, the Taskforce reported that there are some 5,200 homes under construction in Dublin, with permissions in place for a further 23,700 homes on which construction had not yet commenced.  The full report can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i></p><p>Finally, with regard to future planning more generally, the development of the new National Planning Framework, entitled Ireland 2040: Our Plan, is currently underway.  This Framework will shape how Ireland, including Dublin, can and should develop over the next twenty years or more, and how we can plan for and accommodate the substantial additional population expected by 2040 in a more strategic and sustainable way.  My Department is currently analysing and assessing the submissions received under the initial public consultation exercise, as well as preparing other technical analyses to inform the new Framework.  It is my intention to bring a draft Framework to Government by the Summer, for consideration by the Oireachtas later this year.  Further details in relation to the Framework can be found at <i>www.npf.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The Committee published a report on the consultation in January 2016.  This report contains a series of recommendations regarding the establishment of an electoral commission, including functions which should be assigned to it; independence, membership and accountability mechanisms; and the establishment process.  The report is informing the implementation of the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government on establishing an electoral commission and it is informing the preparation of an Electoral Commission Bill to give effect to that.  My Department is in the first instance preparing a Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Bill.</p></reply>

Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.</p><p>The Programme allocation for 2017 is &euro;37.5 million of which &euro;3 million is provided for under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.</p><p>Young people are primarily supported under goals two and three of SICAP, which deal with supporting marginalised individuals to participate in lifelong learning and to become more job-ready, respectively.  SICAP responds to the strategic needs for education and training among disadvantaged groups across the spectrum of life-long learning, from informal to formally accredited education and training, including career advice, job preparing/job search, assisting beneficiaries acquire pre-employment supports such as foundation skills and working on job-ready supports such as CV preparation, interview skills, work placements, mentoring, literacy and numeracy, entrepreneurship supports, as well as achieving defined outcomes of placing people into employment, tailored to the needs of the individual client and in accordance with a personal action plan.  Young people aged 15-24, who are Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEETs), are a dedicated target group under SICAP and are therefore targeted to receive support under goals two and three of the Programme.</p><p>SICAP is delivered in 51 Lots throughout the country.  It is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in the local authority area.  The numbers of young persons supported, or due to be supported (in 2017), in each Lot area, are provided below:<table><tr><th>Lot</th><th>2015 Goal 2</th><th>2015 Goal 3</th><th>2016 Goal 2</th><th>2016 Goal 3</th><th>2017 Goal 2 (Target)</th><th>2017 Goal 3 (Target)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County (1-1)</td><td>82</td><td>52</td><td>47</td><td>76</td><td>35</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County (32-1)</td><td>41</td><td>33</td><td>42</td><td>43</td><td>43</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County (16-1)</td><td>2</td><td>66</td><td>72</td><td>98</td><td>50</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Bandon &amp;amp;

The Court did however visit seven Member States, including Ireland, to assemble material for its assessment. </p>  <p>  The report concludes that the &ldquo;Member States visited had made progress in implementing the Youth Guarantee and some results had been achieved&rdquo; but that &ldquo;the current situation - more than three years after the adoption of the Council Recommendation falls short of the initial expectations raised at the launch of the Youth Guarantee&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The European Commission, to which the Court&rsquo;s report is directed in the first instance, has explicitly rejected this opinion of the Court.  In its &ldquo;Reply of the Commission&rdquo;, published with the Court&rsquo;s report, the Commission </p>  <p>  &ldquo;considers that the current results in Youth Guarantee implementation do not fall short of initial expectations.</p>  <p>Whilst recognising that additional efforts are still needed to reach out to all young people, delivering quality and timely offers, the Commission underlines that the Youth Guarantee has led to positive results.  In particular, as highlighted in the Commission Communication (COM/2016/646) &lsquo;The Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative three years on&rsquo;, it has provided a strong impetus on structural reforms and policy innovation, areas which are outside of the scope of this report.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  For its part, Ireland made clear, in the implementation plan published in response to the Recommendation, that &ldquo;the deeply ingrained problem of youth unemployment cannot be solved with the flick of a switch&rdquo; and that achieving substantial reductions in youth unemployment represented a medium-term goal of economic and labour market policy.</p>  <p>  At the time of the adoption of the implementation plan in December 2013, the seasonally adjusted rate of youth unemployment in Ireland was 25.6%, somewhat above the then EU average of 23.4%.  Since then youth unemployment here has been reduced to 13.9% in March 2017, significantly below the current EU figure of 17.3%. </p>  <p>  Both in absolute terms, and relative to the situation elsewhere in the EU, the improvement in the youth labour market has exceeded expectation in the period since 2013.  The most recent trends suggest that further significant reductions in youth unemployment can be expected in the period ahead.</p></reply>

A robust external evaluation of the scheme conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants in 2016 found that it is one of the most effective labour market programmes &ndash; increasing participants&rsquo; employment outcomes by 32%.  It also found that while participants rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects measured, most were dissatisfied with the level of payment and a sizable minority rated the scheme negatively on some aspects, for example the quality of training offered.  Based on the findings, and taking account of the improvement in labour market conditions, Indecon recommended that JobBridge be discontinued in its current form and replaced with a new scheme.  A copy of the full evaluation can be found at: <i></i>. </p><p>The Labour Market Council welcomed the report and noted the positive employment impact of the scheme.  A majority of the Council similarly recommended that JobBridge be replaced.</p><p>Having considered the evidence and the suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, I announced the closure of JobBridge to new applications from 27thOctober 2016 and my intention to replace it later this year with a new work experience programme better suited to the much improved labour market and that addresses criticisms of the scheme. I proposed that any new scheme should:</p><p>-  Be voluntary for both participants and host organisations.</p><p>-  Offer unemployed people the opportunity to break the cycle of &ldquo;no work, no experience; no experience, no work&rdquo;.</p><p>-  Place greater emphasis on skills development and aim to help participants to develop skills through workplace learning.</p><p>I also proposed that all participants should receive a payment equivalent to the net minimum wage and that host organisations should make a contribution towards its cost.</p><p>I am very conscious that any new scheme would need the support, trust and confidence of employers, jobseekers and the public.  That is why I instructed my officials to consult with key stakeholders on these design principles. Please see below a list of persons and organisations consulted regarding the development of a replacement for JobBridge.</p><p>I expect my officials to report back to me on the outcome shortly, and will make an announcement after I have a chance to consider the feedback from the key stakeholders.</p><p><b>Organisations consulted on the development of a new work experience programme:</b><table><tr><th>Organisation</th></tr><tr><td>IMPACT (&amp;amp; Dr. Mary Murphy)</td></tr><tr><td>National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI)</td></tr><tr><td>Small Firms Association (SFA)</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation (Ibec)</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)</td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU)</td></tr><tr><td>Mandate </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (ISME)</td></tr><tr><td>Chambers Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>National Disability Authority (NDA)</td></tr><tr><td>SIPTU</td></tr><tr><td>National Recruitment Federation in Ireland (NRF)</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Consultative Forum (DCF)</td></tr><tr><td>Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) </td></tr><tr><td>Business in the Community (BITC)</td></tr><tr><td>National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The BSCFA is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs.  The Government has provided &euro;37.4 million for the scheme in 2017. </p>  <p>  End of year records show that under the 2016 BSCFA scheme, payments were made to over 154,000 families in respect of some 283,000 children.  The rate of payment was &euro;100 in respect of children aged 4 to 11 and &euro;200 for children over 12 years in second level education. </p>  <p>  Using the number of children covered by the scheme in 2016 as a basis, the additional cost to increase the BSCFA rates by &euro;50 for each eligible child would be approximately &euro;14.2 million.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 425,000 customers.  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.</p><p>In 2013 the value of the telephone allowance was &euro;114 per annum.  The cost of restoring the allowance at 2013 levels in 2017 was estimated to be in the region of &euro;48 million per annum.  It should be noted that this costing is subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients that would be eligible, were such a measure to be introduced for 2018.<table><tr><th></th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Telephone Allowance</td><td>&euro;48m approximately</td><td>&euro;50m approximately</td></tr></table></p><p>The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p><p>In Budget 2017, it was announced that there would be a further increase in the rate of State pensions, by &euro;5, which increased the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30.  </p><p>Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p><p>Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  On this occasion, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  The scheme has also played an important role in sustaining rural communities.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the RSS is to provide income support to farmers and fishermen and women who have an entitlement to specified social protection payments and who are underemployed in their primary occupation.  The scheme was established as a supplementary income support scheme and is not designed as an employment activation scheme.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my support, and that of the Government, for the RSS.  In recognition of the important work undertaken in rural communities under the Scheme, I announced, as part of budget 2017, an additional 500 places to be made available under the scheme in 2017.  These additional places were rolled out with effect from1st Feb 2017 increasing the overall number of places to 3,100.  This measure, allied to my reversal of the previous cuts to Farm Assist, is evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The RSS is managed by 35 Local Development Companies (LDCs) and by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Na Gaeltachta who are the employers of the supervisors and participants.  The setting of terms and conditions of supervisors employed to support RSS participants are matters for each LDC whose representative body is the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN).  Each supervisor will have a contract of employment with the partnership company, in line with statutory requirements.  Any issues regarding the terms and conditions of RSS supervisors are a matter for discussion with the ILDN and the LDCs.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes more than seventy Post Offices in Northern Ireland and more than one thousand Post Offices in this state.  With the availability of both the online passport renewal service for adults and the An Post Passport Express service, very few applicants in Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.  These appointments must be made online.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the online passport application service which I launched on 30 March will greatly assist in managing current and future passport demand.  The service is for adults who are renewing their existing passport, whether they live in Ireland or overseas and it is available twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  The target turnaround time for applications submitted through the online service is ten working days plus postage.  Since the launch over six thousand online applications for passport books and/or passport cards have been received.     </p>  <p>  The introduction of the service will result in reduced turnaround times and fewer demands over time on the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork.  The service will be extended to all applicants, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.  People who cannot or do not wish to apply online will continue to be able to apply through a service provider with an extensive network of contact points throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the opening of additional Passport Offices, particularly given the range of service options available to applicants, is not clear.  Any office would in any case need to have the capacity to provide a rapid renewal service to applicants with urgent travel such as that available through the Passport Office in Dublin.  This would require an on-site passport production machine in a specially controlled and secure environment.  The purchase cost of a new passport printing machine alone would be approximately &euro;1.7 million.  This is without security, technical, fit-out, staffing and rental costs.  An outreach office without production facilities could not offer a significantly faster service than the online option and it would duplicate the Passport Express service offered through local Post Offices. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants and that the service improvements, both those recently introduced as well as those planned, will allow the Passport Service provide citizen focused services in an efficient and effective manner. </p></reply>

The cost of the Programme in 2016 was &euro;100,000.</p><p>I am aware of suggestions that this programme has been &lsquo;cancelled&rsquo;.  This is not the case.  The programme was run as a trial in 2016 and this was made clear at the time.  It was always our intention to review the pilot this year, to evaluate it and other pilot initiatives and to draw guidance from this for our future engagement with our diaspora.  If it is to be dynamic and meaningful, our diaspora programme has to be willing to test and evaluate new initiatives and new forms of engagement.  But because our funding and resources are finite, we also have a responsibility to evaluate them carefully to ensure that they are both effective in achieving the desired outcomes and efficient in their use of resources.  That process is now underway &ndash; not behind closed doors but in close consultation with the communities abroad whose interests we serve.</p><p>Central to this review process and to the Government&rsquo;s broader engagement with the diaspora is the upcoming Second Global Irish Civic Forum, which will bring together Irish community leaders and members from around the world.  Some 200 individuals working with or on behalf of Irish communities worldwide are scheduled to attend at Dublin Castle on 4-5 May.  The Civic Forum will provide a very valuable opportunity for face to face engagement for organisations abroad facing similar challenges, and for dialogue between these groups and the Government.  </p><p>My Department has developed a programme for the Civic Forum that will be future-focused so that our diaspora can contribute to the evolution of our vision for the future direction of engagement with the Irish abroad.  This will help inform and shape the kinds of projects and initiatives that Government can best allocate funding towards to ensure maximum impact in meeting our key objectives of supporting and engaging our diaspora.  These discussions will include the extremely important question of how best to engage with the next generation, and future generations, of our communities abroad.  Of course, in relation to the Global Irish Summer Camp, it may be the case that the result of these discussions and the wider review underway could be that a different model or models would be identified as having greater potential for engaging more effectively, or with larger numbers of young people.</p><p>As Minister for the Diaspora I remain absolutely committed to promoting and facilitating meaningful, inclusive engagement with all generations of the global Irish diaspora.  While the nature of specific projects and initiatives that the Government funds may evolve over time, and will always require review to ensure that we achieve maximum impact and value for the Irish taxpayer, our steadfast commitment endures to foster and facilitate a vibrant, diverse global Irish community, connected to Ireland and to each other.</p></reply>

In this respect the United Nations has recently been loudly sounding the alarm call.  Its warning last month of its need for assistance in reducing the risk of starvation and famine in South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and northeast Nigeria was a stark reminder of the problems confronting civilian populations in many parts of the world.  And last week the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, speaking at the Brussels Conference on supporting Syrians and the region, reminded us that the need for humanitarian aid and the protection of Syrian civilians has never been greater.  Mr. Guterres added that the UN is determined to reach everyone in need through all possible means.  He has made it clear more generally that conflict prevention and protection of civilians will be his priority during his term of office that started in January.</p>  <p>  The UN has a vital role in promoting the resolution of armed conflicts which cause so much of the misery faced by civilian populations.  It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has, under the UN Charter, primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland remains a strong supporter of the rules-based international system, with the UN at its centre.  At the same time, we recognise that it must work better for the people whose lives it has been designed to protect and improve.  It is clear that the Security Council must work with greater unity.  It is also clear, as Ireland has consistently stated, that the Council needs to become more representative, more transparent and more efficient.    </p>  <p>  In 2015, the former UN Secretary General initiated three major review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The findings from the high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published and are in the process of being implemented.  Each of these reviews offer recommendations on how the UN can improve and reform its functions and structures particularly in relation to the global challenge presented by conflict and war.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform. </p>  <p>  Other efforts to increase the UN&rsquo;s effectiveness in meeting its current challenges are ongoing.  These include the development of a Global Compact on Refugees, arising from the High-Level Summit on large movements of refugees and migrants which took place at the UN in New York in September 2016, and which was co-facilitated by Ireland.  The Global Compact will set out a framework to improve the way in which the international community responds to large movements of refugees and migrants, as well as to protracted refugee situations.  </p>  <p>  Discussions on improvements to the effectiveness and accountability of UN peacekeeping missions are also taking place at the UN, most recently in a UN Security Council thematic debate on 6 April at which UN Secretary General Guterres set out plans for a review process which will make recommendations on improvements to the UN&rsquo;s peace and security architecture by June of this year.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a consistent and strong contributor to the UN&rsquo;s peacekeeping operations.  It is in our interest for peacekeeping operations to receive clear, realistic and up-to-date mandates from the Security Council.  We support the establishment by Mr. Guterres of a small Executive Committee at UNHQ to provide more coordinated planning, control and leadership of the UN&rsquo;s operations and strategy.

At the conference co-chaired by the EU and the UN in Brussels last week, I promised that Ireland would provide at least &euro;25 million this year to support those affected by the crisis.  A further &euro;5.75 million has been provided in for Iraq, including &euro;3 million in 2016.  </p>  <p>  Our funding is channeled through a range of partners, including UN organisations, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, and NGOs, who are best placed to respond.  These partners provide humanitarian supplies and urgently-needed health, education, water and sanitation services, as well as protection for children and vulnerable families.  On my recent visit to Jordan and Lebanon, I saw how Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is helping refugees to meet their daily requirements, and I heard how their ambition is to return in safety to their homes.  </p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to the EU, Ireland is supporting the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria and Iraq, including the Turkey Refugee Facility.  Funding from the Facility has been used to launch the largest humanitarian programme in EU history, the Emergency Social Safety Net, which provides direct monthly cash transfers to the most vulnerable refugee families in Turkey. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, we have also deployed 43 experts through our Rapid Response Corps to the Balkans and Middle East, to work with UN agencies responding to migration challenges resulting from the Syrian conflict. </p>  <p>  Given the volatile situation in Iraq, we expect to provide additional funds to the UN&rsquo;s Iraq humanitarian operation this year, focusing on the needs of the displaced.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to monitor developments in the region very closely and will work with partners to ensure that our assistance helps to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, including displaced and refugee communities. </p></reply>

The funding is directed towards the provision of life-saving assistance including food support, shelter, and the provision of basic services including health, education and water and sanitation.   </p>  <p>  In 2016, we also provided &euro;7.5 million in core funding to UNICEF, the UN Agency which leads the work globally to provide clean drinking water in humanitarian crises.  Water is a basic need and fundamental human right, but many people around the world, including in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Nigeria, lack access to a safe, uncontaminated and local water supply.  Access to a safe, sufficient, clean water supply is particularly difficult in conflict situations, due to displacement, lack of resources and disruption of services by armed groups. </p>  <p>  The latest UNICEF figures on water and sanitation in emergencies show that, despite progress in many areas, significant work is still required to ensure that people in humanitarian situations can access sufficient water safely for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene. </p>  <p>  Specifically, Irish Aid works with partner organisations to meet the water, sanitation and hygiene needs of those affected by conflict and violence, as well as other humanitarian crises.  Since the start of 2016, 7 water, sanitation and hygiene specialists from Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have been deployed to support UNICEF&rsquo;s and UNHCR&rsquo;s humanitarian and emergency responses.  We have also supported the UN to provide vulnerable communities with access to safe water in Yemen and elsewhere.  The provision of safe, sufficient, regular and clean water supply is also a priority for the International Committee of the Red Cross, a key humanitarian partner for Ireland.  ICRC water teams work in over 80 countries, including in Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen, providing water for populations affected by conflict and violence </p>  <p>  Through such partnerships and through our engagement at international level on our humanitarian and development programmes, Ireland continues to support the rights of every man, woman and child to the essential resource of water.</p></reply>

The Somali Government is supported by the African Union, and the EU and UN, in working to improve security.  The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), the African Union Peacekeeping Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and EU support for Somali army training and maritime security are vital to this work.  Ireland has contributed &euro;31 million in humanitarian assistance, since 2012, including almost &euro;6 million last year.  Last month, we contributed a further &euro;3 million to the UN-managed Somalia Humanitarian Fund.  Later this week, we are airlifting over 100 tonnes of Ireland&rsquo;s stockpiled humanitarian relief supplies into Somalia.  The airlift, worth over &euro;600,000, will be dispatched from the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the EU pledged up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and other West African countries.  Since 2015 Ireland has provided over &euro;3 million in humanitarian funding for those affected by the crisis in North East Nigeria and the wider region.  We have also deployed six personnel to various UN partners in the region under the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative. </p>  <p>  Al Shabaab and Boko Haram create an environment of insecurity resulting humanitarian crises that make it difficult to meet humanitarian needs.  Every effort is taken to ensure that international aid is not interfered with by such groups.  The presence of AMISOM troops and the Somalia National Army helps ensure that humanitarian assistance is delivered to those communities that are most in need, but the task remains a challenging one. </p>  <p>  We are continuing to monitor developments in relation to both Al Shabaab and Boko Haram, and to work with the relevant Governments, regional authorities and other key partners to address the humanitarian crisis through diplomatic engagement and humanitarian funding.</p></reply>

During this time, more than 1,000 child abductees have escaped or been rescued.  The risk of abduction in the north-east of Nigeria remains high and there have been further abductions this year.</p>  <p>  Since they were abducted by Boko Haram in April 2014, Ireland has consistently called for the release of the Chibok schoolgirls.  I welcomed the news in October 2016 of the release of 21 girls following talks facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Swiss Government. </p>  <p>  The international community remains engaged in dialogue with the Nigerian Government on how to enhance security and build safe communities.  In order to assist the Nigerian Government in creating a safe and secure environment for its people, the EU and UN have continued to provide assistance.  Last year, the EU pledged support of up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, which supports 8,700 troops from Nigeria and other West African countries.  Since 2014 the EU has also contributed over &euro;74 million in humanitarian assistance to Nigeria. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments closely through our embassy in Abuja, which remains in close contact with the Nigerian authorities on the threat posed by Boko Haram.</p></reply>

That makes strong and continued delivery on current priorities all the more important.  While there are differing views about the order and emphasis on different policy priorities &ndash; jobs and growth, Single Market and Digital Single Market, migration, internal and external security and defence &ndash; there is convergence on the need to communicate that the EU will prioritise delivery for its citizens, re-dedicate itself to its core values, and reaffirm its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>as the embodiment of peace, stability, democracy and the Rule of Law in these uncertain times.  </p><p>Delivery on these important issues should serve to rekindle citizens&rsquo; trust in - and support for - the EU and the values it espouses.</p></reply>

Over 128 million people in 33 countries around the world are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  The UN has identified the emergencies, in Syria, Iraq and Yemen as particularly complex crises in conflict situations which have resulted in significant displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels and serious concerns for the protection of civilians.  At the conference on Syria last week in Brussels, I promised that Ireland would provide at least &euro;25 million this year to support those affected by the Syria crisis.  We have provided &euro;76.5 million to those affected by the crises since 2012.  We have also provided &euro;5.75 million for Iraq since 2012 and we have provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen.  I am also deeply concerned about the situation of millions of people currently facing famine, or threat of famine, in Somalia, South Sudan and north east Nigeria.  &euro;11 million in new funding from Ireland was announced last month to assist people suffering in the Horn of Africa, and we have committed to provide at least &euro;5 million in 2017 in response to the ongoing severe humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad region.  Some &euro;115 million in humanitarian funding has been provided to the Horn of Africa since 2012. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations, and we are committed to responding in a timely and effective manner to the most severe humanitarian crises and emergencies, in particular to protracted and forgotten crises.  </p>  <p>  At the World Humanitarian Summit, which I attended in Istanbul last May, significant commitments were made by donors, including 35 specific commitments by Ireland, to ensure faster and more effective delivery of humanitarian aid.

Already the issue has been discussed at three of the four meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council held so far this year.</p>  <p>  The background is a very troubling one of stagnation in the political process and worsening developments on the ground.  The significant effort led by France last year, including the holding of two major conferences, was able to maintain an international focus on the issue but was not able to restore any momentum to the political process.  Regrettably, the Israeli Government refused to attend or to engage in any way with the French initiative.  The Palestinian side, aware of this, has also focused its attention elsewhere for the moment.  </p>  <p>  The stance of the new United States Administration is, as ever, likely to be a major factor in prospects for reviving the peace process.  The Administration is currently engaged in a policy review and President Trump&rsquo;s new Middle East envoy has just returned from his first exploratory visit to the region.</p>  <p>  For our part, Ireland and our EU colleagues remain fully committed to a two state solution to the conflict, as the only option which can meet the needs of both sides, however difficult it may be to achieve.  This is also the overwhelming view of the international community, as expressed in Security Council Resolution 2334 in December, and in the Declaration of the second Paris Conference which I attended in January.

Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, is at the heart of the EU&rsquo;s strategy and is reflected in a substantial increase in assistance to third countries in this respect.</p>  <p>  The EU has placed considerable emphasis on its immediate neighbourhood: Western Balkans, Turkey, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.  Actions include finalising Counter-Terrorism action plans with Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey, expanding the EU Counter Terrorism experts&rsquo; network to the Sahel and Western Balkans, and focusing on preventive action on conflict and violent extremism prevention priorities identified through the EU Early Warning process.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach is guided by, and is consistent with, the approach taken by the UN to countering terrorism and by the principles and measures set out in relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2161 (2014) on freezing funds and other assets of terrorist groups, and UNSCR 2178 (2014) on measures to suppress the recruiting, organising, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to another State to plan or carry out terrorist acts or training.</p>  <p>  The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism, presented in January last year, and his related reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism, and to highlighting the need to address drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at EU and UN levels level to preventing and countering terrorism.  At meetings of the Council, I have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  I have emphasised the need to ensure a joined-up approach in relation to the discussions of Foreign Ministers and those of our Justice and Home Affairs counterparts with a view to a coordinated and comprehensive response to terrorism that can help ensure the safety of citizens abroad and in Ireland.  </p></reply>

Ireland provided over &euro;190 million in humanitarian funding in 2016 to assist people affected by crisis and conflict around the world, including refugees from war zones.  In addition, Ireland also contributes to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of some &euro;1 billion.</p>  <p>  The ability to deliver international aid to vulnerable populations according to their need is critical. Ireland works at EU and UN level to advocate for increased humanitarian access, more effective means of providing assistance, and respect for international humanitarian law.  In 2016, we provided &euro;7 million in core funding to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as well as &euro;4.8 million in humanitarian funding for its work in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Chad. </p>  <p>  In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross, to which we provided &euro;14 million in 2016, reminds authorities and others of their legal obligations under international humanitarian law as part of their mission to protect and assist the victims of war. </p>  <p>  The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa illustrate clearly the need for the UN, in particular, to enhance its capacity to respond more effectively to conflict and the associated need for humanitarian protection.  Providing safe areas within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where civilian protection is not prioritised. Safe areas require UN mandates and robustly equipped peacekeeping personnel.  On my recent visit to Jordan and Lebanon, I witnessed for myself the important role played by UNIFL in ensuring the safety and protection of those affected by conflict, through its UN-mandated peacekeeping mission.    </p>  <p>  The blockages at the Security Council in recent years have prevented the international community from acting together in a way that would allow civilians in conflict zones to be afforded greater protection.  Ireland advocates strongly for reforms to the membership and working methods of the Security Council, and we will continue to do so to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges arising from conflict situations worldwide.  </p></reply>

The approach taken to this review differs from the Comprehensive Spending Reviews undertaken in 2011 and 2014 in that it does not cover total Government expenditure in a single year.  The 2011 and 2014 reviews were conducted at a time when Ireland was about to enter, or already in an Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) under the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).  Now under the preventative arm of the SGP, we find ourselves in a different fiscal and economic landscape where moderate, sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium term. </p><p>This year's review is the first in a planned series of 'rolling' selective reviews that will take place each year to 2019.  This review will systematically examine existing spending programmes to assess their effectiveness in meeting policy objectives and to identify scope for re-allocating funding to meet expenditure priorities.  This will allow Government to tackle any concerns identified in these areas while also potentially making some funding available for high-priority policies.  A significant portion of expenditure will be examined in 2017, with the remainder to be examined in 2018 and 2019.  Over the three year cycle, the totality of Government expenditure with the exception of pay rates will be reviewed in overall terms.  Engagement is ongoing between officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and those in other Government Departments on the topics under review for this first year. </p><p>The chosen approach to the Spending Review has been informed by the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service paper 'Spending Reviews in Ireland: Lessons for the Future' and has been tailored to reflect the changed context and lessons learned from previous reviews.  A copy of this paper is available at <i>igees.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>This approach of ongoing examination and re-prioritisation of funding is standard international practice in public expenditure management.  It allows for an examination of the totality of Government spending on an ongoing basis, rather than focusing on the additional amount that may be available in a given year.  This is intended to ensure that the maximum efficiency and effectiveness is achieved for every euro of public funding and allows a focus on the medium-term sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. </p></reply>

This reversed the system under previous legislation whereby new bodies would have to be brought into the scope of the legislation by order.  The 2014 Act extended the remit of the legislation to a further 70 public bodies, bringing the overall total to some 600 bodies comprehended by the Act.</p><p>The types of bodies that are subject to FOI under the Act, in whole or in part, are as follows:</p><p>- Governments Departments and agencies under their remit</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p><p>- Local Authorities</p><p>- Education and Training Boards</p><p>- Health Service Executive</p><p>- Voluntary Hospitals</p><p>- Universities and other higher education institutions</p><p>- Regulators, such as the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Commission for Communications Regulation</p><p>- National Treasury Management Authority and its subsidiary bodies</p><p>- Central Bank of Ireland</p><p>- Refugee and asylum seekers bodies, such as the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Board;</p><p>- Commercial State Companies operating in a monopoly market, such as Irish Water, Irish Rail and the energy network functions of ESB, EirGrid and Ervia.</p><p>Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Act sets out the semi state bodies which are exempt from the Act.</p><p>The Act also provides the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with the power to make an order bringing a body under the Commissioner's remit if it is financed, wholly or partly, or directly or indirectly by means of monies provided by a Minister of the Government.  I am sure that the Deputy would share the view that there has been substantial progress and a planned and structured approach of continuing to extend the Commissioner's remit is one that he would share.  </p><p>I do not currently have any plans to bring further bodies within the scope of Freedom of Information.</p></reply>

One of the core objectives of the plan is to raise awareness and understanding of the benefits and value of raised bogs and to encourage community involvement to inform future decisions.  During the implementation of the programme of restoration measures on designated raised bogs, my Department intends to explore with local stakeholders the opportunities for the provision of recreational amenities within the designated raised bog network.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a limited provision for the funding by my Department in 2017 of small scale conservation and community education and awareness projects in areas affected by the cessation of domestic turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.  </p>  <p>  There are also a number of schemes highlighted in the Action Plan for Rural Development and administered by my Department through which funding may be able to be provided for a project such as that referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. </p></reply>

The LEADER programme requires that all applicants meet certain eligibility criteria, including that they are financially solvent, they are not excluded from the programme as a result of a previous non-compliance, and the applicant is actively repaying any debt associated with this or previous Rural Development Programmes.  In order for a project from any club or society to be eligible for LEADER funding, the project must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy in the sub-regional area concerned, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.  </p><p>As a first step, clubs and societies wishing to apply for project funding under LEADER should submit an Expression of Interest outlining their proposals to the LAG delivering LEADER in their area.  The LAG will then be able to advise of the specific criteria that may apply for projects of a particular nature and the application timeframes involved.  </p><p>Contact details for the organisations implementing LEADER are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no adult patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and the NTPF has indicated that the initiative has commenced and patients will start to receive their appointments before Easter.  The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long-waiting patients including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Surgery, Dental, Urology and Vascular surgery.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  My Department is currently engaging with the HSE and the NTPF to finalise these plans. </p>  <p>  In relation to your specific query on paediatric ENT appointments in Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. </p></reply>

St. James&rsquo;s is Ireland&rsquo;s largest and leading adult teaching and research-intensive hospital, with the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals. It has a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner. Co-location with St James&rsquo;s, and ultimately tri-location with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, is best practice internationally and will deliver the excellence in clinical care.</p>  <p>  In line with leading practice in children&rsquo;s hospital design, those who need to stay in hospital will have their own single room.  Each of the 380 single rooms, with the exception of critical care rooms, will have an en-suite bathroom and facilities for a parent to comfortably stay overnight.  The Ronald McDonald House Charity plans to build a new 53 bedroom Ronald McDonald House adjacent to the new children&rsquo;s hospital allowing parents and other children to stay as necessary.</p>  <p>  A dedicated school will be provided, incorporating a range of educational services, including artwork and pottery, in a stimulating environment that is conducive to learning and is medically equipped to cater for children on ventilators and other mobile electronic medical equipment. It will be fully wheelchair and disability compliant.  Dedicated schoolrooms will be provided on three of the inpatient units to cater for children unable to attend the main school due to clinical treatments (including oncology/ haematology and renal dialysis). </p>  <p>  Children who cannot attend the school due to disease processes or infection control issues will also be provided with alternative educational support in their room or via appropriate online facilities managed by the school principal.  The main hospital school will be located in a central area with direct horizontal and vertical links to the inpatient units and will incorporate four large classrooms for primary and post primary schooling; two specialist classrooms which may include wet areas for arts and crafts.  Children and adolescents will be educated separately in age-appropriate accommodation. </p>  <p>  The therapeutic benefits of the outdoors will be catered for in the rooftop garden which will offer opportunities for learning, play and distraction.  The garden's play decks and terraces will offer a range of outdoor spaces that are rarely found in most hospitals.</p>  <p>  The design of the hospital has recognised the need of most parents to access the hospital by car, and 675 car parking spaces have been provided for families based on current and projected future demand, and a further 325 for staff (1000 in total, three times the current number of parking spaces for existing paediatric hospitals).  The parking system will also allow families to reserve spaces ahead of arriving to the hospital, and emergency drop-off spaces are also being provided. </p>  <p>  The needs of children, young people, their families and those who will work in paediatrics are being taken into account throughout this project.  The Youth Advisory Council, (a group of children and young people), amongst others, has provided input, advice and feedback on the development of the new hospital and its future services at regular meetings with the project directors. </p></reply>

The aim is to improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area, Wicklow, Kildare and parts of Meath, and support primary and community care paediatrics, as well as reducing Emergency Department and outpatient attendance at the main site.</p>  <p>  Each centre will provide consultant-led urgent care from staff of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and appropriate diagnostics. Each centre is projected to deal with 25,000 urgent care attendances per annum.  There will be 12 outpatient consulting rooms located in the satellite centres, with each centre having 6 short-stay observation beds (4-6 hours) and 10 assessment bays.</p>  <p>  The provision of general paediatric rapid access clinics will meet the need of primary care for access to specialist opinion (secondary paediatric opinion) &ndash; currently many children are referred to tertiary specialists when they don&rsquo;t need that level of expertise, resulting in longer waiting lists.  The satellite centres will also provide general community and paediatric clinics including developmental paediatrics, multidisciplinary care for children with chronic stable conditions and other outpatient services.  Each centre is expected to cater for a minimum of 15,000 outpatient attendances per annum.</p>  <p>  The satellite centres will be open during the known busiest daytime and evening hours and closed during the night when departments are at their quietest.  It is anticipated that the urgent care centres in Tallaght and Connolly will open from 08.00 to 24.00, diagnostic services from 08.00 to 20.00 and outpatient services from 08.00 to 18.00.</p></reply>

While I do not wish to influence the Committee's deliberations, neither can I verify what might or might not form part of its Report.</p>  <p>  However, as Minister for Health I would caution that making private health insurance less affordable for people by withdrawing tax relief without improving ‎the public health system would only serve to increase reliance on services that are already under pressure and worsen standards for everyone.  The cost to the Exchequer of providing Tax Relief on Health Insurance premia (&euro;325 m in 2015) must be seen in the context of the overall premiums paid (circa &euro;2462 m) and circa &euro;2000 m claims paid during the same period.  This includes income generated from the treatment of private patients in the public system.  In addition, any unintended consequences such a policy change might have on the sustainability of our community rated PHI market, the sustainability of the health insurance industry and the future viability of private healthcare would required detailed and careful consideration.  The phasing out of tax relief on health insurance premia is not something I as Minister for Health would support.  However, decisions in relation to taxation policy are a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, who would give careful consideration to all of the likely knock on consequences arising from such proposals before making a recommendation to Government.</p></reply>

This was done in the context of HSE management having developed a fully funded workforce plan for an additional 1,208 nursing/midwifery posts in 2017.  The proposal includes permanent contracts for future graduates with scope for a career break and extensive education and personal development opportunities for nurses and midwives to upskill.  The management side is also positively disposed to a proposal from the union side for the restoration of a number of allowances for new entrant nurses and this consideration will be concluded in the upcoming pay talks in the summer, following on from the publication of the report of the Public Service pay Commission.  A relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas and this is to be extended with a second &euro;1,500 allowance after a period of 12 months.</p>  <p>  The above is in addition to the many other initiatives currently underway to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country.  The HSE has offered permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates.  The HSE is also offering full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts and is also focused on converting posts filled by agency staffing to permanent posts.  Its National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing graduates.  Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  In October 2016 the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.</p>  <p>  The measures that were proposed by management and agreed with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing will significantly improve the staffing of nursing and midwifery posts in the public health service and offer serving and new nurses and midwives enhanced opportunities to advance their careers.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently under way.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively; in that regard, it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, the Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway. I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small business for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. </p></reply>

Addressing the Forum, I took the opportunity to highlight that one of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers. </p>  <p>  Therefore I was pleased to facilitate the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides tillage farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years and are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme. I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  I am meeting with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  The Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme will be Friday 30 June 2017.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I am pleased to record that to date &euro;1.183 billion has been paid out under the 2016/17 Basic Payment Scheme to 123,929 farmers and these payments are ongoing.  Furthermore, payments of &euro;201.38 million have also been made to 94,101 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm to the Deputy that a wide ranging discussion took place among all the stakeholders who attended the recent session of the Tillage Forum, including on the issue of crop losses as a result of the poor harvest conditions of last autumn.  My officials have since then had some further meetings with stakeholders and I will consider further the outcome of those deliberations.</p></reply>

The lead authority for these regulations is the Department for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the regulations is to protect surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of farmyards and the application of  livestock manures and other fertilisers in accordance with good practice and to meet crop requirements.</p>  <p>  In order to protect human health, buffers are established regarding the distance within which livestock manure may be applied adjacent to an abstraction point of water for human consumption.  There is provision within the regulations to adjust these buffers on the basis of a technical assessment which deals with relevant factors such as soil and subsoil type, water quality evidence, risk to human health etc.  A 2 m buffer applies in relation to the application of chemical fertiliser.  Such assessments are a matter for the local authority under the guidance of the Department of Planning, Housing and Local Government.</p></reply>

It is a sector that I intend to ensure receives the continued support of my Department both at this time and into the future.  There are a number of supports currently in place for the sector under the Rural Development Programme not least the &euro;300 million Beef Data and Genomics Programme.  This scheme builds upon the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  The question of targeted supports of up to &euro;200 per suckler cow is a complex one and could, for example, necessitate a redistribution of funds allocated to farmers under Pillar I.  This would involve a linear cut across payments to all BPS beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding under Pillar II of the CAP, the BDGP as already outlined is the current central support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next six years.  Increasing the level of payment under this scheme would require the approval of the EU Commission, and even if this were possible, would require the redistribution of funding from other rural development measures, and would require additional measures in an already complex scheme to justify any additional payments.  I do not see this as a realistic option. </p>  <p>   It is vital that the current BDGP programme is supported through the lifetime of the current RDP.  This is, of course, in addition to the other supports which are in place for suckler farmers under the RDP, notably GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer groups.  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers are the most appropriate way to support the continued development of this sector.</p></reply>

My Department and Bord Bia are involved in on-going work to encourage and facilitate such exports.  The Deputy will be aware that, in February last, my Department reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal from &euro;4.80, in order to bring greater equity in the fees payable per consignment in respect of calves, weanlings and adult cattle.</p>  <p>  The cattle export trade in 2017 is positive after two years of decline.  To date, exports of live cattle in 2017 have increased by almost 22,000 head, or 43%, in comparison to the first quarter of last year.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work to ensure that Irish meat and livestock producers have the option of exporting to markets abroad for both processed meat and live animals.</p></reply>

The most recent Waste Packaging Statistics for Ireland published by the EPA in May 2016 show that Ireland has met and exceeded the overall packaging waste recovery rate and the recycling rate targets since they came into force.</p><p>In accordance with the waste hierarchy, prevention and re-use are the most desirable options for managing waste and the increase in usage of reusable coffee cups instead of those made partially or wholly of plastic is a positive development in that respect.  However, if an item is certified compostable in accordance with EN Standards, it means that it will break down into nutrient-rich soil within an 8-12 week time-frame when commercially composted.  Compostable packaging, including coffee cups, can as a consequence be organically recycled along with food waste in the organic brown bin.  More Brown Bin information is available at .</p><p>Repak is the approved producer responsibility compliance scheme for packaging in Ireland and it is tasked with meeting recovery and recycling targets established under the EU Packaging Directive.</p><p>As the plastic cups comprise of composite materials, they cannot be easily recycled.  However, these cups are recovered and are not sent to landfill, but are sent for waste to energy.</p><p>In addition to the above, I will be considering the potential for the introduction of new environmental levies, such as one on disposable cups,  to encourage improved environmental behaviour by the public and industry in the context of the Review of the Environment Fund that is planned for later this year.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>On the 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to their plans to provide broadband to  an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to doing this work over the next 90 weeks, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  The rollout plan has been agreed with my Department and this along with the tight deadline will be monitored closely by my Department to ensure that they meet their obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>On the same day I published  an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie which finalises the State Intervention area.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.</p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p><p>There are c.2.3m  premises covering Ireland&rsquo;s 26 counties, of which approximately 542,000 premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map, and will require State Intervention.  The remaining 1.8m  premises are located in the BLUE area and will  be served by commercial operators.  Of the 1.8m premises, some 300,000  premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver high speed broadband by end of 2018.  Further information of eir's planned rural deployment is available at a .</p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.</p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.</p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p><p>The Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p></reply>

An individual who is resident in the USA and holds an American driving licence may therefore drive in Ireland as a visitor.</p>  <p>  Under EU law we may issue licences only to persons normally resident in the jurisdiction.  A US resident visiting Ireland would not be eligible for an Irish driving licence or, by extension, an Irish driving test.</p>  <p>  It would appear that there is a failure by the motor insurance companies to cater for persons who are not normally resident in the State but spend a few months of the year here on an intermittent basis.</p>  <p>  Oversight of the motor insurance industry rests with the Central Bank, which in turn comes within the remit of the Department of Finance.  My Department raised this issue with the Department of Finance in January 2017, following publication of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  That Department noted the broad issue as one appropriate for their discussions with the insurance industry and Insurance Ireland in particular over the coming months regarding relevant actions in the Report.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that there is a Declined Cases Agreement mechanism, which is used where a person has been refused motor insurance by a number of insurers.</p></reply>

Aggravated congestion occurs when the number of vehicles on a part of the network is higher than the network can handle and the point at which serious traffic delays arise.  The first phase of the project, which is currently being finalised, estimates the annual value of time lost to road users due to aggravated congestion in the greater Dublin area.  The study uses data from a variety of sources to estimate activity on the network including census travel to work data, NTA GDA surveys, car ownership data and CSO small area population statistics.  The project has been carried out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Dublin City Council, DCC, with particular support from the NTA's modelling team in producing the modelled outputs.</p>  <p>  A final project report will be published on my Department's website in the coming weeks.  However, I understand that the analysis undertaken for the report estimates that the cost of time lost due to aggravated congestion in the greater Dublin area  is currently &euro;350 million per annum and is forecasted to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum in 2033.  This work is an important consideration in formulating my overall approach to tackling congestion in the short to medium term and forms a key part of the case for increased public transport investment, as part of the mid-term review of the Government's capital plan in 2017.</p></reply>

The Commission found that sub-minima rates of a similar nature are in use in a number of OECD countries.  It concluded that incidence of usage of the sub-minima rates in Ireland is extremely low, with available evidence suggesting that just 0.1% of employees are currently in receipt of the youth rates and between 0.2 and 0.3% are in receipt of the trainee rates.  Their report also indicated that there is no evidence of significant abuse when it comes to the application of sub-minima rates. </p>  <p>  Given that the remit of the Low Pay Commission is to make its recommendations using an evidence-based approach, the Commission had agreed with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in early 2016 the inclusion, on a pilot basis, of a specific question on the national minimum wage, and the use of sub-minima rates, in the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey series.  The Commission indicated in its 2016 report that it did not consider it appropriate to make recommendations on the appropriateness of the current sub-minima rates at that stage, but would await the availability of the up-to-date data on usage of the rates from the CSO before making any recommendation.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the results from the pilot question for 2016 are currently being verified by the CSO, and I understand that the Low Pay Commission intends to submit its recommendations in a supplementary report, on receipt of the verified data from the CSO.  The question of whether a change in the current system might be warranted or desirable will be considered further in light of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. </p></reply>

The Directive on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) caters for business to consumer (B2C) transactions only and is intended to offer a simple, fast and low-cost alternative to civil litigation for consumers in order to resolve disputes between consumers and traders.  The scheme is voluntary for traders and there is no obligation on them to participate in ADR procedures which are offered by ADR entities, if they choose not to do so.  However, there is an obligation on traders to make consumers aware of the possibility of using ADR procedures if they wish to do so where a complaint about a good or service has arisen.  Engagement with ADR procedures does not impair the consumer&rsquo;s rights under relevant consumer protection legislation.</p>  <p>  The requirements in relation to general information contained in article 15 of the Directive were transposed into Irish legislation through sections 5(2), 5(3) 5(4), 6(2) and 12 (2) of S.I. 343 of 2015. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) was designated as the competent authority under section 5(1) of S.I. 343 of 2015.  The European Consumer Centre Ireland was designated under section 6(1) of S.I. No. 343 of 2015 as the body responsible for providing information and assistance to consumers about accessing ADR entities operating in another Member State relating to disputes arising from cross border sales or service contracts which are competent to deal with a consumer&rsquo;s cross border dispute. </p>  <p>  The CCPC has statutory responsibility for notifying dispute resolution entities as qualified ADR entities to the EU Commission under section 7 of S.I. No. 343 of 2015.  The CCPC carries a list on its website of such notified entities.  In addition, the CCPC supports the work of the European Consumer Centre Ireland under the regulations in relation to providing information and raising awareness about ADR procedures for consumers in Ireland.  Activities undertaken by the European Consumer Centre Ireland to promote awareness and use of ADR procedures include hosting seminars, making public presentations and issuing press releases and publishing leaflets about the use of ADR procedures. </p></reply>

The Scheme provides therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  Extern have been contracted to operate the scheme by providing a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.  The scheme offers greater options to the courts in the knowledge that close monitoring will take place through interaction with the young people, their families and communities.  It works with young people aged 12-17 years old who have initially been denied bail and remanded in detention.  A Multisystemic Therapy [MST] treatment model is used to support the young person and their parent/caregivers to increase compliance with bail conditions if the young person is released from detention back into the community.  MST is a family and community based treatment programme that addresses the multiple determinants of serious antisocial behaviour in young offenders.  It empowers parents and caregivers to support their child to make positive changes across the individual, home, community, peer and school systems.  Each family is assigned an MST therapist who will work intensively with them, including multiple contacts with family and other participants every week and &lsquo;On Call&rsquo; support available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Treatment lasts between three and five months with the overarching goals of the Bail Supervision Scheme to support the young person to be at home, in education/training/employment and constructively engaged.</p><p>The Scheme aims to reduce the number of young people on remand in detention.  On conclusion of the pilot phase of the Scheme, a formal review will be undertaken with the intention thereafter of putting in place a managed roll out of the Scheme nationwide.</p><p>To date the scheme has worked with 11 young people and their families.  The level of support offered is very high with sessions taking place both in the family home and in the community.  The number of missed or cancelled therapy sessions has been minimal and the re-engagement in education/training programmes in particular has been high, especially given that the young people concerned had been out of education for a long period of time. </p><p>The normal rules around breaches of conditions of bail are observed.  Based on international evidence, this scheme should impact remand trends by offering the court the option of<i>&lsquo;</i>bail with supervision&rsquo; (as an alternative to a remand to detention).</p></reply>

A significant number of these remain living with their foster carers.  Those who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education. </p>  <p>  The care leavers most vulnerable to homelessness are those leaving residential or short-term foster care placements.  Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p>  <p>In addition to the aftercare planning and supports provided by Tusla, Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness  commits to ensuring that young people leaving State care who are at risk of homelessness are identified and catered for through appropriate housing and other supports. </p>  <p>  Funding is now, for the first time, available under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate young people exiting State care.  My Department is currently working closely with Tusla on the development of principles and criteria relating to any such funding proposals.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also redistributed the protocol on young people leaving State care, agreed with the City and County Managers Association, to Housing Authorities and within Tusla itself.  The aim of this protocol is to ensure that the necessary measures are in place to prevent homelessness for young people leaving State care and will be applied within aftercare steering groups, on which representatives of the Local Authorities sit in conjunction with other stakeholders, for the delivery of aftercare support.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to build on implementation of the framework to date which has been supported by the national voluntary childcare organisations and the city and county childcare committees.  The initiative is designed to provide central support and coordination of S&iacute;olta (The National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education) and Aistear (The Early Childhood Curriculum Framework) implementation across the Early Years sector.  This initiative involves the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) &amp;amp; NCCA and is funded by the DCYA.  Two national coordinators have been appointed to oversee the initiative and 60 mentors have been trained to support early years settings to implement both Aistear and S&iacute;olta on a national basis.</p><p>The Aistear strand of the initiative aims to help practitioners gain the knowledge and skills required to develop their own emergent and inquiry-based curriculum informed by Aistear<i>. </i>In this way, the<i></i>initiative will enhance the quality of pedagogy across early childhood settings and in doing so, better support children&rsquo;s learning and development.  A CPD programme in Aistear is being piloted by the NCCA in the first half of 2017 in 162 settings, with 401 practitioners participating in the pilot.</p><p>In addition to the NSAI, DCYA also provides funding to the National Voluntary Childcare organisations and childcare committees to undertake a range of quality improvement supports, guided by S&iacute;olta and Aistear.</p></reply>

In 2017, I provided for &euro;1m of additional funding to be made available to childcare providers who have been facilitating the training of Community Employment participants, to ensure that regulatory changes do not impact on service delivery or the availability of childcare places.  Officials have been working with Pobal and Childcare Committees Ireland to get funding out to services impacted by the change in relation to CE scheme participants; and I understand that contracts to enable payment have now issued to services.  Funds will be disbursed without delay once these contracts are signed.  Funding will be provided in two phases, the first phase to cover advertising and recruitment costs, and the second phase, which will follow more detailed financial analysis of services, in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In addition, funding of &euro;14.5 million will be made available for the first time in 2017 for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; to recognise the increasing volume of work done outside of direct contact hours with children. </p>  <p>  The sector has taken the initiative of commissioning and completing research highlighting the challenges that they face and I am acutely aware that we need to get the funding model right for these services.  This is a complex issue; and I hope that providers will appreciate that we have had to move to tackle the most urgent issues first, designing a new model of eligibility for families - the Affordable Childcare Scheme, tackling the CE scheme issue, and providing funding for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time.  I remain committed to addressing other sustainability and quality issues, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The last two budgets delivered a 35% increase each year in funding for childcare.  However, it is recognised that there is a need to continue to invest and a strong case will be put forward for more resources in 2018 and beyond.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence sets out the Defence policy framework for the next decade.  Chapter 4 of the White Paper sets out the policy context for the provision of a broad range of &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; supports.  It states that Defence capabilities are primarily developed for security purposes rather than for other ends, and that this will remain the key focus.   </p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard search and rescue services can request the support of the Air Corps on an &lsquo;as available&rsquo; basis under a Service Level Agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, the most recent of which has been in place since 2013.  If requested, and if available, the Air Corps provide &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; for the Coast Guard using the CASA fixed-wing maritime patrol aircraft.  Coast Guard helicopters also provide their own &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; during Search &amp;amp; Rescue missions. </p>  <p>  Availability is dependent upon a number of criteria including the availability of suitable aircraft, the availability of flying crews, the availability of Air Traffic Control services and the suitability of weather conditions.  As I have outlined in replies to previous parliamentary questions, there are currently restrictions on Air Traffic Control services in Casement Aerodrome and shortages of experienced pilots.  The Air Corps is not providing fixed wing aircraft for routine operations, on an ongoing basis, outside normal hours.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the terms of the Service Level Agreement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As such the Air Corps CASA aircraft will continue to respond to requests from the Coast Guard for &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; on an as available basis.  While there are a range of actions underway which are intended to improve the general availability of Air Corps Aircraft for all roles assigned, there are no plans to dedicate CASA aircraft to the provision of &ldquo;top-cover&rdquo; on a 24 hour basis.</p></reply>

I am advised that Doxycycline is an antibiotic which has a wide range of applications, including as a prophylactic agent in the prevention of malaria.  It has very limited application in the actual treatment of malaria.</p><p>I am further advised that there is a contradiction between Section 4.5 of the SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) and Section 4.2 of the SmPc.  One points out that the absorption of Doxycycline is impaired by concurrently administered antacids containing inter alia calcium and the other advises that if there is gastric irritation, it is recommended that Doxycycline be given with food or milk.  The SmPC is contradictory as milk and dairy products such as cheese contain large amounts of calcium.  This contradiction was already apparent to the Director of the Defence Forces Medical Branch and the Defence Forces Medical Officers.</p><p>Presently, I am informed that the advice in relation thereto would indicate that dairy products should not be consumed within a certain number of hours before the Doxycycline and should not be consumed thereafter for a certain number of hours.</p><p>Investigations in relation to this which includes a dynamic review of up to date publications indicates that for maximal absorption of Doxycycline it should never be taken contemporaneously with dairy products. <b></b>However, a pragmatic approach is applied if required, on the basis that partial absorption of the active ingredient is preferable to no absorption at all resulting in a level of protection albeit reduced.</p><p>There is, I have to state, no contradiction of the position in the context of earlier replies to Parliamentary Questions, but rather the contradiction exists within the Summary of Product Characteristics.</p></reply>

The 2017 Cadetship competitions were launched on 22 March 2017.  Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  The purpose of Direct Entry Competitions is to recruit people with specialist qualifications or skills in order to fill vacant appointments in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  A recruitment campaign for the appointment of Direct Entry Naval Service Officers, in the Operations Branch, Marine Engineer Branch and Electrical Engineer Branch of the Naval Service, is currently on-going.  This campaign does not preclude existing Defence Forces personnel from applying for such competitions.  Nor is there a prohibition on existing personnel being assigned to specialist functions where their qualifications permit such internal redeployment.  In relation to promotional vacancies, promotions are ongoing within the Officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies.  A new NCO promotion competition, to fill vacancies to the ranks of Sergeants and above, has been launched.</p>  <p>  Promotions from the Order of Merit Lists from this competition will commence in Q3 2017.  Promotions at Corporal rank take place at formation/service level when vacancies arise within Units and where there are qualified personnel in these Units to fill the appointments. </p>  <p>  In relation to specialised functions within the Air Corps, I am advised that Department officials have recently met with the military authorities to explore options available in relation to the filling of same, these discussions are ongoing.  The Deputy may wish to note that any such proposals will fall to be discussed under the Defence Conciliation &amp;amp; Arbitration scheme. </p>  <p>  It is my intention that targeted recruitment, along with promotions, will continue to be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.</p></reply>

However, there are no restrictions on former members of the Defence Forces joining other military services.  It should be noted that terms of enlistment for enlisted personnel, post 1994, are for five years in the Permanent Defence Force and 7 years in the Reserve Defence Force.  Section 241 of the Defence Act prohibits members of the Reserve Defence Force from joining the armed forces of another state.  However, should a member of the Permanent Defence Force discharge by purchase prior to the completion of their contract, they would no longer have a commitment to Reserve service and therefore would no longer be considered a member of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>
