    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-24a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013042400062#WRB00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 54 together.</p><p>  The number of people classified as underemployed rose significantly during the crisis, from 81,000 at the end of 2008 to 146,000 at the end of 2011 and remained unchanged through to the end of 2012.  This type of increase is typically observed at the start of all downturns and is evidence that some employers put workers on part-time employment as part of an adjustment strategy to cope with the reality of recession.  The most recent data indicate that almost one third of all part-time workers are underemployed.</p><p>  Some people classified by CSO as underemployed receive income support from my Department to supplement their earnings in employment.  The number of such casual and part-time workers included in the Live Register, for example, rose from about 20,000 in early 2008 to almost 90,000 at the end of last month.  In addition, other persons classified as underemployed may be receiving payments from my Department under the Systematic Short-time Working Scheme, under schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s that provide part-time temporary employment, and under other working-age schemes such as the One Parent Family Payment scheme.</p><p>  A key factor driving this rise in underemployment is the weak labour demand in the domestic economy.  The approach to reducing underemployment is the same as that for reducing unemployment.  The Government's primary strategy to tackle both unemployment and underemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs.  Through the Pathways to Work strategy, we are trying to ensure that persons on the Live Register are in a position to take up full-time job opportunities as they arise.  This is being done through a range of activation measures to provide support and assistance to jobseekers combined with  a renewed focus on building relations with employers in order to encourage recruitment of people from the Live Register.</p><p>  Measures of particular relevance to counteracting underemployment are those that incentivise employers to give full-time jobs to persons who are currently on the Live Register (including the underemployed), most notably the Employers PRSI Incentive and the Revenue Job Assist Scheme.  These will be replaced in July of this year by JobsPlus, a single simplified programme.</p><p>  The Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) Scheme is intended as a stepping stone to full-time work partly in recognition of the reality of underemployment.  It allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker's payment.  The Department also supports jobseekers to transition to full-time employment through the Family Income Support Scheme.</p><p>  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the Department provides income support to the underemployed to supplement their earned income, via Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit/Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, provided a person is working no more than 3 days a week.  Jobseekers payments paid in conjunction with such periods of casual employment may now count towards satisfying the qualifying period for access to the JobBridge Internship programme. Underemployed casual workers are also entitled to access a range of part-time training and education opportunities for unemployed people.</p></reply>

In 2013 some &euro;19 million has been allocated to fund MABS while the Citizens Information Board has a budget of some &euro;47.4 million.  The CIB and MABS National Development Limited are working closely to ensure that the appropriate structures are in place within MABS to implement this new and important statutory role. They have also engaged proactively with the Insolvency Service to ensure that the Approved Intermediary Service is fully operational in time for the establishment of the Insolvency Service.  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 provides for a Debt Relief Notice (DRN) for persons with no assets or income with unsecured debts of up to &euro;20,000. With the assistance of an Approved Intermediary, a person may apply for a DRN which will allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt after a three year supervision period.<b></b>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has the statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has<font color="#4181C0"> </font>agreed to my request that MABS be an Approved Intermediary for the purpose of processing applications for Debt Relief Notices. Those who can avail of DRNs are typically part of the MABS core client cohort of people on low incomes in debt or in danger of falling into debt.</p><p>  I am satisfied that MABS will play an important role in the new arrangements for dealing with debt and will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p></reply>

It also aims to increase engagement and incentivise employers to provide more jobs for people who are unemployed.  The unit includes staff dealing with JobBridge, the European Job Mobility Portal (EURES), and the National Contact Centre, which hosts the Jobs Ireland website, as well as staff providing policy and coordination support to employer engagement across the country.  There are over 35 staff working in the Employer Engagement Unit.  The unit includes staff dealing with JobBridge, the European Job Mobility Portal (EURES), and the National Contact Centre, which hosts the Jobs Ireland website, as well as staff providing policy and coordination support to employer engagement across the country.  There are over 35 staff working in the Employer Engagement Unit.  In addition there are approximately 400 staff in the Department's regional divisions who work on employment services with both employers and jobseekers.  As part of this structure there are 13 dedicated officers at senior management level leading the engagement process with employers at a regional level.</p><p>  Turning to the issue of contracting, as part of its employment service provision, the Department already contracts with other providers for the delivery of both the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  Employment services, including career planning, engagement with employers and job search assistance, are provided under contract by these organisations to clients who are activated by the Department.  The Department funds this contracted provision to the value of approximately &euro;25m per annum and these organisations employ approximately 390 staff, who are engaged in the provision of these services.</p><p>  The Department is at present considering how it might supplement its existing delivery capacity through the further expansion of contracting.  The Department has engaged external services in a variety of areas such as Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.  The Department retained the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (CESI) in November 2012 to provide expert advice with regard to the potential for, and the design of, a contracting model based on a risk sharing payment structure.  The Department is currently considering the CESI report and will in due course finalise its own position.  It is important to note that, although the term &lsquo;private contracting&rsquo; is used in some quarters to indicate service provision by organisations outside of the direct state sector, experience in other countries indicates that the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors feature strongly in the supply-chain.</p><p>  As set out in Pathways to Work, the introduction of the new Intreo service is a multi-annual project.  The first ten Intreo offices went live in 2012.  These are Sligo, Arklow, Tallaght, Kings Inns, Ballymun, Buncrana, Coolock, Dundalk, Finglas and Killarney.  A further 2 offices are now providing the full Intreo service in Newcastlewest and Blanchardstown.  Preparations are underway in a further 8 offices and it is expected that a total of 43 offices will be delivering the Intreo service by the end of 2013.  The remaining offices will be providing the integrated service by the end of 2014.</p></reply>

The appeals system was reformed in 1990 to establish the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) as a separate executive office with its own premises and staff operating independently of the Department.  In the twenty years since that reform there has been no sustained or concerted criticism relating to the independence of the office or the impartiality of its Appeals Officers. The independence of the office is evidenced by the high level of appeals which were allowed in favour of the appellant (50.4%) in 2012.  In this context, Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers and are required to be, and are, free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.</p><p>  The appeals system was reformed in 1990 to establish the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) as a separate executive office with its own premises and staff operating independently of the Department.  In the twenty years since that reform there has been no sustained or concerted criticism relating to the independence of the office or the impartiality of its Appeals Officers. The independence of the office is evidenced by the high level of appeals which were allowed in favour of the appellant (50.4%) in 2012.  This issue a searchable, anonymised database was the subject of a recent High Court case, Ikraam Jama v Minister for Social Protection, 11 October 2011. The Judge in that case found that there was no duty on the SWAO to maintain a database for public access. In the course of that challenge, comparisons were drawn with the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Tribunal who do publish their decisions. In 2010, the Social Security Commissioners in Northern Ireland finalised 141 decisions, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal finalised 2,783 and the Equality Tribunal finalised 322 whereas the Social Welfare Appeals Office finalised 28,166 decisions in the same period.</p><p>  Given the volume of social welfare appeals which are decided annually (32,558 appeals were decided in 2012), the provision of such a database would be a vast and resource-intensive undertaking. For example, in creating and maintaining such a database, it would not be enough to remove names and addresses, all personal information would have to be removed so that not even a family member could recognise the case.  Equally, examining anonymised cases could also be misleading given the wide range of variables between the circumstances of different individuals and where the slightest variation between circumstances might mean a different conclusion would be arrived at.</p><p>  However, it is recognised that there is a clear need to strike a balance between achieving effectiveness and efficiency in administering the appeals system and the need to ensure fair and equitable access to customers. In this regard, the   <font color="#2F2F2F">number of case studies published on the Social Welfare Appeals Office website was increased by 100 last year and it is proposed to publish a similar number this year.</font></p><p>  While civil legal aid is not available to appellants, my Department provides funding to a number of organisations to provide information, advice and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services, including the Social Welfare Appeals process. These organisations include the Citizens Information Board, the National Advocacy Service, which focuses particularly on people with disabilities, and the INOU which focuses on the unemployed. In addition, funding is also provided to the Northside Community Law Centre to provide information, advice and representation on legal matters.</p></reply>

All of the staff in question serve on a full-time basis.  In addition, and in view of the critical control role that Medical Assessors play in assessing and reviewing illness related claims, sanction was also given to appoint additional Medical Assessors to fill vacancies which will be due to arise in the near future as a result of retirements.  A public competition, administered on behalf of my Department by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), was held in 2012.  Fourteen people were placed on the panel that was established following completion of the competitive process.</p><p>  To date six Medical Assessors have been appointed from this panel, three of whom took up duty in November 2012 and a further three in March of this year.  Four of those placed on the panel have subsequently withdrawn from the process.  My Department has continued to liaise with the PAS with a view to appointing the four remaining candidates at the earliest opportunity.  In this regard, one offer of appointment has been issued, a further two are expected to issue shortly and clearance from the PAS is expected in relation to the last candidate in the coming days.</p><p>  I place great emphasis on ensuring that all claims are processed and reviewed in a timely manner and I&rsquo;m very pleased that the Department has been able to fill these critical vacancies and to frontload the appointment of additional Medical Assessors in advance of retirement thereby enabling the Department to deliver a quality service to our customers.</p></reply>

Employment offers the best protection for those at risk of poverty and this is especially the case for families with children. The model of child care which is available in Scandanavia is a very comprehensive model although it is also very expensive.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D/CYA) estimates that the cost of universal child care provision in Ireland could reach around &euro;1 billion per annum.  In light of the current fiscal environment, this level of funding is not available.  The scheme will provide 6,000 places on an annual basis and will cost &euro;14m. The first phase of this pilot scheme for the provision of after school childcare places will begin on 29 April.  Up to 500 childcare places will be available to people who have been long term unemployed or were former recipients of the One Parent Family Payment and who have got a job offer or have significantly increased their part time work.</p><p>  The rate of subsidy for the scheme is &euro;35 per week rate of subvention and a parental contribution of &euro;20 per week per child. During school holidays the subvention rate will increase to &euro;100 per week but the parental contribution will remain at &euro;20 per week.  Customers who meet the criteria will get a letter of eligibility so that they can apply to the local childcare committee for a place. The new scheme will incentivise and support people who are long term unemployed to avail of an employment opportunity by providing them with increased access to subsidised after-school child care.  The scheme will build on the existing supports provided for, and implemented by, the D/CYA in the child care sector, including the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) schemes, through which child care is provided to some 40,000 children of low-income parents at reduced rates.</p></reply>

Thee Estimates are based, in the main, on an analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2013.  Actual trends on individual schemes are being closely monitored on an on-going basis.  Decisions about the adequacy of resources available to the Department will be taken in the overall budgetary context.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware Ireland is in the final year of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The references to financial targets in the agreement relate to the overall fiscal consolidation, not to Departmental or sectoral budgets.  The Troika recognise the scale of this spending on social protection and have emphasised the importance of reform in this area both as a contribution to fiscal consolidation and to facilitate economic recovery.  They have not however identified any specific programmes that should be curtailed or discontinued in their view, nor have they specified any savings or expenditure targets in the social protection area.  Although the Troika may identify areas of expenditure which they believe merit examination, any changes to the schemes operated by the Department are decided by Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, in the context of the on-going review of expenditure generally and in the context of deciding the fiscal consolidation measures to be included in Budget 2014.  </p><p>  In relation to Budget 2014, the Deputy will be aware that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Expenditure Report 2013 published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of &euro;440 million to be achieved in 2014 in the Department of Social Protection budget.  Reducing overall expenditure in 2014 in line with this target will be very challenging.  No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these targets will be met.</p></reply>

Currently there are c 6,000 people on internships with c 2,500 internships opportunities available to be filled.  In order to assess the impact of the scheme the Department commissioned Indecon economic consultants to complete an independent evaluation based on an analysis of Departmental data and surveys and interviews with host organisations and interns.  I expect to publish the final report from Indecon in May.  </p><p>  Indecon&rsquo;s interim report, published last year, found that 61% of interns secured employment either with their host organisation or another employer within 5 months of finishing an internship.  These progression rates compare very favourably with similar schemes across Europe.  The evaluation study also found that 67% of internships were with private sector host organizations.  The participation of large numbers of private sector host organisations is making a significant contribution to the quality of experience for interns and in improving their chances in entering the workforce.  </p><p>  Of those individuals who undertook their internships in private sector host organisations, 54.1% were in employment at the time of the research (this includes interns who had just completed their internship) of whom 30.2% were in employment with their host organization.  This indicates that c one third of interns progress from an internship into direct employment with the host organisation.  The issue of host organisations making a financial contribution to the weekly top-up payment to interns is under review in my Department.  However any change to existing arrangements will need careful consideration as one of the advantages of the existing scheme is that it is simple to understand and administer for interns, host organisations and the Department. </p><p>  With regard to the issue of displacement the Department has taken all reasonable steps to minimise displacement of existing paid employment by internships.  The terms of the scheme prohibit the use of internships to displace existing employees, there are limits on the number of internships a host organisation can offer (no more than 10% of the workforce at a particular location), host organisations are not permitted to &lsquo;roll-over&rsquo; internships by replacing one intern with another at the end of the internship, and all applications from host organisations are screened to minimise the possibility of displacement.  Nevertheless displacement may be subtle and it is impossible to eliminate it completely.  </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s own control measures are based on a combination of randomised monitoring visits/inspections with host organisations and on investigation of complaints received from interns.  As of 18th April, 2013, 15 host organisations have been excluded from further participation in JobBridge as a consequence of these control activities.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.</p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.</p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. The Group concluded that there is no one perfect method of targeting child and family income supports. While some members of the Advisory Group found that taxation of child benefit is an attractive reform option, it was recognised that this approach, being  limited to only one child and family income support payment, does not contribute to a better overall design of the child and family income support system. For this and other reasons, there was a strong preference in the Group for another approach based on a two-tier child and family income support payment.  The Group considered that this approach would allow for a rationalisation of the overall child income support system while minimising work disincentives and allow for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different household types.</p><p>  Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused, in the first instance, on this cohort of unemployed people.  It is recognised, however, that not all unemployed people (including those previously self-employed) are dependent on the State for financial support and some services (for example assistance with jobsearch activities, use of online job search tools) are available to such people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices.</p><p>  It should also be noted that the State is funding over 450,000 in further education, higher education and training, namely:</p><p>  - 75,000 F&Aacute;S training places.</p><p>  - 180,000 Further Education places, 162,000 of which are full-time Higher Education places provided in Universities and Institutes of Technology across the country.</p><p>  - Over 40,000 training places through Skillnets, including 8,000 for the unemployed, in partnership with private employers.</p><p>  - The Momentum initiative provides free education and training projects for up to 6,500 long-term unemployed jobseekers.</p><p>  - Over 6,000 Springboard, free part-time higher education, places in 2012, with additional places to be announced for this year.</p><p>  Eligibility for accessing many of these interventions is not contingent on receipt of a social welfare payment or signing for credited contributions.  Extension of the initiative to those not associated with the Live Register is not being considered given the current size and construct of the Live Register, in particular the numbers of people who are now long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In this context, the Government intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to maximise the impact of a youth guarantee in Ireland. We have sought funding from the European Commission for a the proposed pilot Youth Guarantee project in the Ballymun area of north Dublin, and numerous organisations (e.g. IBEC, Ballymun Job Centre, National Youth Council of Ireland) have agreed to participate in this pilot. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The scale and nature of any additional measures required for the gradual implementation of a guarantee at national level will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly, require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.  In total an additional 10,000 places will be provided. </font> Other relevant provision is made through the training and education programmes delivered through F&Aacute;S and the further education sector.  <font color="#2F2F2F">The size and the timescale for any additional provision that is both desirable and feasible, over and above that outlined above, will be established over the coming months.</font></p></reply>

The Table below provides details of processing times for each of the Department&rsquo;s schemes in March 2013.  A further breakdown of the time taken for the individual steps in the processing of claims is not available.  All claims are registered promptly, in some schemes this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while in other schemes this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to perform means tests and/or medical examinations where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence where required is an integral part of the decision making process.</p><p>As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  Work on clearing backlogs in some scheme areas, such as carers allowance and invalidity pension has temporarily distorted the time taken to clear claims due to the high level of reviews and appeals following backlog clearances, but the progress made will be reflected in processing times in the coming months.  Both schemes are up to date with the processing of new applications, as is family income supplement for both new and renewal applications.</p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.</p><p>The new Intreo service is currently being rolled-out and implemented on a phased basis.  This new service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalized service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo Centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into the Department.  The benefits of the integrated decisions process are already visible in terms of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary payments in offices where integrated decisions are in operation.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputies that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me. Each scheme area is continuously monitored and processing procedures reviewed to ensure that claims are paid to customer as quickly as possible.</p><p><b>Table: Claim processing times - March 2013</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div>Scheme</div></th><th><div>Average weeks to award</div></th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (contributory)</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (transition)</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>State pension (non-contributory) </td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Pension (contributory)  </td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widow(er)'s Pension (non-con) pension &amp;amp; one parent family payment (widow)</td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family </td><td><div>13</div></td></tr><tr><td>Household Benefits</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant </td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension </td><td><div>60 (claims received in the last 6 months are decided within 8 weeks.

Any host organisation which is found to be displacing paid staff in contravention of the scheme rules will be disbarred from further access to the scheme.  In addition, all existing internships with that host organisation will cease with immediate effect.   I understand that the facility referred to in the question is operated by a private firm operating under contract with the local authority.  The complaint made is currently being investigated by the Department and I am advised that an investigating officer has been in contact with both the individual who raised the complaint and with the host organisation.  I expect a report on the matter to be finalised shortly.</p><p>  The whole purpose of Jobbridge  is to encourage job creation and to incentivise employers to offer opportunities to unemployed people. It runs counter to the logic of the scheme that it  should be used to displace existing employees onto the live register and I will not tolerate such behaviour.   In fact the scheme has been designed and is operated with a number of controls designed to minimise the risk of such behaviour. Specifically:</p><p>-  The host organisation may not provide an internship opportunity under the Scheme to an individual with whom they have an existing employment relationship </p><p>-  The host organisation cannot advertise internships if they have paid employment vacancies in the area of activity in which the internship is offered.</p><p>-  The total number of internships which may be availed of by a host organisation is limited to 1 in 10 of their workforce or, in the case of very large employers, an absolute limit of 200 staff.</p><p>-  Organisations must abide by a six-month cooling-off period between internships; in other words an organisation cannot &lsquo;roll-over&rsquo; internships on a continuous basis. This limits the ability of an internship to substitute for a permanent role.</p><p>-  The host organisation must commit to provide coaching and mentoring to the interns and to complete monthly compliance returns to the Department of Social Protection</p><p>-  All applications from host organisations to advertise internships are reviewed and assessed against these criteria by the Department&rsquo;s National Contact Centre in Edenderry. </p><p>-  The Department of Social Protection proactively monitors  internships on an ongoing basis.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conduct of random monitoring site inspections.  Since Jobbridge was launched 1,712 monitoring visits have been conducted. </p><p>-  All complaints received from interns or members of the public are investigated.  In addition to the regular monitoring regime, 275 complaints have warranted investigation since the Scheme commenced.  </p><p>-  To date 15 host organisations found to have breached the scheme criteria have been excluded from further participation in the Scheme.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the design of the scheme together with the intensive monitoring regime operated by the Department minimises the level of displacement and acts to protect the interests of host organisations, interns and the wider labour market.</p></reply>

On that basis, only posts that are absolutely critical will be considered as to whether they can be filled.

Lump sum payments made by the Department are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  In order to be eligible for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must: be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; be over the age of 16; and have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation  meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  In addition, the employee must have at least 104 weeks continuous service, with the employer who is making the statutory redundancy payment.  This ensures that the employee has had a reasonable attachment to that employer.  I have no plans to change this requirement.</p></reply>

In this context, it has engaged in discussions with the relevant medical health professionals and with representatives from interested NGOs.  Given the legal complexities involved in relation to some of the GRAG recommendations relating to the marital and civil partnership status of individuals, in March 2012 the Department sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General, which in turn sought the legal opinion of external counsel on these issues.</p><p>  The formal opinion of the Attorney General was received in December 2012 and is currently under consideration by officials in this Department with a view to progressing the draft Heads of the Bill.  There are a range of complex and sensitive issues involved in this proposed legislation to give legal recognition to the acquired gender of transgender persons.  I have requested the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the provisional draft Heads of Bill once they are completed.  I feel that the committee can make a very positive contribution to the preparation of the legislation and I hope that my officials&rsquo; appearance before the committee can be scheduled before the summer.  I believe this approach should greatly assist the drafting of the legislation and its progress through the Oireachtas.  When the Oireachtas committee has discussed the provisional draft heads of Bill I will be in a better position to give a timeframe for the introduction of the legislation.</p></reply>

A report on the Forum will be completed in due course.</p><p>  Following a comprehensive review in 2012, the Government revised the national social target for poverty reduction.  The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 (interim target) and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2 per cent. Ireland&rsquo;s revised contribution to the EU poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the population in &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; between 2012 and 2020.  In addition, the Government has agreed to set new sub-targets for children and jobless households and to strengthen the implementation of the target through annual monitoring and social impact assessment. </p><p>  The Department recently published, for the first time, a &ldquo;Social Inclusion Monitor&rdquo; using the latest data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to report on progress towards the national social target for poverty reduction.  In 2011, the consistent poverty rate was 6.9 per cent, which according to the CSO &lsquo;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&rsquo;.  The consistent poverty trend in the first year of monitoring the new target reflects the severity of the economic crisis but also demonstrates the effectiveness of policy given the strong performance of social transfers in protecting those on the lowest incomes.  In 2011, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 40 per cent to 16 per cent, representing a poverty reduction effect of 60 per cent (rising to 68 per cent if pensions are included).</p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that it is too early to draw firm conclusions on the extent to which poverty can be reduced over the coming years.  However, the Government expects that effective and targeted policies across all Government programmes and Department - coupled with improvement in the underlying economy and labour and boosted by the commitment of the social partners and civil society - will yield future dividends on reaching the national social target for poverty reduction in the years up to 2020.</p></reply>

The disallowance/disqualification reasons and grounds are outlined clearly and are sufficient to enable the appellant to lodge an appeal.  Persons are advised, in the decision letters, of their right to seek a Department of Social Protection (DSP) review of the initial decision and are also advised as to how to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  Where a review is sought, the DO re-examines the case and, taking account of any new facts or evidence, may revise his/ her decision.</p><p>  6,035 of the appeals finalised in 2011 were revised decisions made by DOs who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  This figure illustrates that the review process is well understood and utilised.  Many revised decisions arose as a result of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his /her claim.  In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary and obviated the need for claimants to go through the full appeals process.  DOs are reminded through on-going training, guidelines and circulars of the rules of natural justice and the submissions and decisions process of the SWAO.  Furthermore the Department constantly monitors the decision making process and implements any changes required to ensure a high standard of decision making is maintained.</p><p>  The Department processes in excess of two million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week.  It is important to emphasise that the staff in this Department are very conscious of their obligations to claimants and every effort is made to ensure people receive the entitlements due to them.</p></reply>

This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994.  They may, however, be eligible for participation on other programmes, although they may not qualify for payment of an allowance e.g. F&Aacute;S training courses.  Such persons are advised to contact their local Employment Services Office or Intreo office (where available) where an Employment Services Officer will be happy to discuss the employment and training options that are open to them.  There are no proposals currently under consideration in regard to making changes to the national operation of the Community Employment Programme.  Within the current very difficult budgetary constraints, the number of places on Community Employment is being expanded up to 25,300 by the end of 2013.</p></reply>

However, as part of its overall function of research into poverty and social exclusion issues, the Department has indirectly supported research related to this area, namely through a social policy project approved by the Irish Research Council under its Research Development Initiative in 2010.  The project titled 'Establishing Minimum Income Standards for Irish Households'<i></i>was a joint initiative of Trinity College Dublin, Department of Economics and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  The latter body has a long-running series of research publications in this area.  A report on the study titled 'A Minimum Income Standard for Ireland - A consensual budget standards study examining household types across the lifecycle' was published in 2012 and is available at the following link ().</p></reply>

Details of all grant recipients since 2006 can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at http://www.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=298.    The emphasis of the Emigrant Support Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, front-line welfare services, targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, particularly in Britain and the United States.  These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of these communities overseas through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.</p><p>In addition, the ESP has facilitated Government support for a range of community and heritage projects, strategic capital projects and other initiatives aimed at creating practical results-orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, including those that emerged from the Global Irish Economic Forums.</p><p>I am pleased that, despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained the 2013 funding for the ESP at &euro;11.59 million, the same level as 2012.  The focus in 2013 will be on key front-line welfare and advisory services and on projects aimed at supporting new arrivals.  The 2013 grant round closed on 20 February.  Applications for 360 projects from 16 countries are currently under review. I expect to be in a position to make announcements in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As a new service that will have exceptional temporary pressures at particular stages of its initial implementation it is difficult to predict the level of contact that will arise during its introduction and, consequently, the resource required to handle queries from members of the public.  The Expenditure Report for 2013, which was published in December last, makes a provision of &euro;25.9m in 2013 for the implementation of LPT.  The total cost of LPT to the end of March 2013 is approximately &euro;6.6m.</p><p>  Revenue considered a number of options for the provision of a phone call service to handle queries from members of the public. Revenue decided to use a mix of existing staff, staff from the redeployment resource panel, temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) and external resources to deal with Local Property Tax.  At the end of March 2013, Revenue had a total of 155 full-time equivalent staff assigned to LPT, comprising 125 permanent and 30 TCOs.  The permanent staff resource was filled through the internal redeployment of existing staff and the recruitment of a total of 29 staff from the Public Service Resource panel.  Revenue is currently in the process of recruiting an additional 25 TCOs to support the introduction of LPT.</p><p>  Following an open competitive tendering process, the contract for call services was awarded on the basis that the service provider would </p><p>  1. Deliver information and assistance to taxpayers having difficulty understanding LPT and completing their returns and making payments.</p><p>  2. Assist taxpayers to navigate a new online system for filing returns and payments for LPT. </p><p>  3. Escalate calls to a Revenue call service where taxpayer specific information is required to resolve the call.</p><p>  4. Make outbound calls to taxpayers with information on their LPT queries where requested by Revenue to do so.</p><p>  5. Provide telephony infrastructure and supports to allow direct transfer to Revenue.</p><p>  6. Support services and resources including account management and quality control.</p><p>  The service is provided on a 9 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday basis. The service provider has the ability to scale operations up or down in response to call volumes.  The service must meet Revenue customer service standards and the industry ISO standards and Revenue has provided training and training material to ensure that the standards are achieved.  An Irish language service is provided.  The necessary confidentiality and security procedures have been implemented as agreed.</p><p>  The service commenced on 7 March 2013 and call volumes of 108,100 were handled up to 16 April 2013.  Regular operational management, reporting and review meetings were provided for in the contract.  Reporting arrangements and quality monitoring arrangements were agreed and are being delivered.  The nature of the contract is that the cost will depend on the volume of calls handled.  In accordance with the relevant Government decision, the Revenue Commissioners publishes quarterly lists of payments over &euro;20,000 and payments made under this contract will be included in future lists.  Revenue has advised that a total &euro;67,000 was spent on external service delivery of call centre services in Q1 2013.</p><p>  The external service delivery of peak call handling in respect of the LPT provides a flexible, scalable response to an unpredictable demand.  It also provides assurance that the introduction of LPT will not adversely affect Revenue&rsquo;s capacity to deliver for the Exchequer in relation to their overall priority of maintaining and improving levels of compliance across the range of taxes and duties.</p></reply>

Nor is there any provision in VAT law that would make it possible to apply an exemption or the zero rate to the supply of such products.  In the circumstances, the supply of personal alarms is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  The supply of parts and accessories is also liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p><p>  I would point out that Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 enables VAT paid on qualifying goods to be refunded where the goods are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement.

A personal alarm for a disabled person may qualify for relief under the Order if it may be considered an aid or appliance constructed or adapted for use by a disabled person having regard to the particular disablement of that person.  A Claim Form VAT 61A is available on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie).</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may be aware of the Seniors Alert Scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which provides grant support for the supply of equipment to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  </p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:</p><p> 1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.</p><p> 2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.</p><p> 3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.</p><p> 4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.</p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.</p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection. The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income. It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.    </p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.</p></reply>

Furthermore, it was recommended in the Report of the Commission on Taxation in 2009.  The current situation is that a pensioner is liable to pay tax through the Income Tax self-assessment system or is taxed through the PAYE system based on an adjustment of tax credits.  The Department of Social Protection provides details electronically to Revenue of the recipients of a range of DSP payments and their pension amounts on a weekly basis, and this also includes details of increases and decreases in the pension payment.</p><p>  I am advised that while the Revenue Commissioners agree with the proposal that tax should be deducted at source by DSP there are a number of issues for DSP that need to be considered and addressed before it could be introduced.  It is clear that deduction at source is the most efficient way to collect the right amount of tax from pensioners who have sources of income other than the State pension.</p></reply>

The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2010 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.  Corresponding data cannot yet be provided for 2011 and 2012, as the tax returns for these years are either in the early stages of being filed or are not yet due.</p><p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that Finance Act 2012 contained two measures related to property reliefs designed to reduce the ongoing cost of these schemes to the Exchequer and to eliminate it in as short a time as possible.  With effect from 1 January 2012, a USC surcharge was introduced on all investors with annual gross incomes over &euro;100,000. The surcharge applies at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by property reliefs in a given year and will be in addition to any normal USC payable on this income. This USC surcharge applies to all investors with this level of gross income regardless of whether they invested in Section 23 type investments or accelerated capital allowance schemes.</p><p>  In addition, investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015. Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed. The delayed implementation of this measure is designed to give individuals time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision. </p><p>  In relation to capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on certain qualifying hospitals, the termination date for incurring qualifying expenditure was 31 December 2009.  However, where certain conditions were met a later termination date of the 31st December 2013 may apply.  There are now only two property based tax incentive schemes remaining in the tax code: the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Investment scheme (only 80% of expenditure can qualify in certain areas) and the Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units scheme, which was not commenced.</p><p>  All other such schemes have been terminated, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to entail ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.  Because of the nature of some of those reliefs, individuals have a right to claim them for a seven-year period. There are a number of legal considerations that would hinder the abolition of the reliefs during such run down periods.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the high earners' restriction continues to apply to these legacy reliefs, and ensures that those subject to the full restriction pay a minimum effective rate of income tax of 30% in addition to USC, PRSI and the surcharges mentioned above, where applicable. The latest report from Revenue &#8220;Analysis of High Income Individuals' Restriction 2010&#8221; which can be found at <i></i> highlights the rates of tax paid by individuals subject to the restriction.</p></reply>

That lending is backed by a floating charge on the otherwise unencumbered assets of IBRC and supported by a Ministerial guarantee. This ended the CBI&rsquo;s lending relationship with IBRC and NAMA became the largest creditor to the liquidation.

As the Deputy will be aware extensive work has been undertaken by both the former Board of IBRC and my officials in relation to the winding up of IBRC.  The Deputy will appreciate it was not possible to fully engage with the bank or its management in relation to the liquidation in advance of the transaction as this would have triggered legal obligations for the directors of the bank.  However, extensive information in relation to the assets and liabilities of IBRC was provided to and held by the Department of Finance as part of its normal engagement with the bank including the audited Annual and Interim financial reports and accounts for the periods prior to liquidation, loan loss and provisioning exercises, internal and external auditor reports, Board papers and presentations, monthly management reports, financial presentations and other information provided to officials as part of their normal interaction with the bank.</p></reply>

Ireland faces further budgets where a reduction in public expenditure across all areas of public provision, including education, will be necessary.

Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category, including children with mild general learning difficulties. In this context, children with a mild intellectual disability qualify for resources under GAM. Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05. </p><p>  Once allocations have been made, it is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of resource teaching support, including supports allocated under the GAM, to best support the needs of qualifying pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, or with regard to their child's educational progress in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.</p><p>  All schools have been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March 2013 and schools will be notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation in advance of the 2013/14 school year, based on the number of valid applications received. </p><p>  The position in relation to pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools is that they may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected in the coming months.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Following the Government's decision of 21 February 2012, the school to which the Deputy refers was among the schools which retained disadvantaged legacy posts from previous disadvantage schemes.  </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a range of factors contribute to determining the staffing requirement for individual schools including changes to enrolment and the reforms to the teacher allocation process in 2012. As the teaching allocation to schools, including disadvantage legacy posts, are enrolment based, this determines whether schools gain or lose teaching posts from year to year.  Some schools seemed to be under the impression that the Government decision of February 2012 in relation to legacy posts, implied that they would retain the number of legacy posts which they had in the 2011/12 school year. I wish to clarify that legacy posts are retained in schools from year to year, only where warranted, based on the enrolment of the previous 30th September.  The individual schemes such as Breaking the cycle, Giving children an Even Break and the Disadvantage Areas Scheme no longer operate.</p><p>  The enrolment at the school in question, which is a DEIS Band 2 school currently has two legacy posts. The school's enrolment  increased slightly on 30 September 2012 over its previous year's enrolment.  As a result of this increase, one of the legacy teaching posts, which is part of the current staffing (2012/13 school year), will be subsumed as part of the mainstream staffing for the 2013/14 school year.  The school will retain one  legacy teaching post for the 2013/14 school year.  In summary, the school in question will retain the same number of classroom teaching posts for the 2013/14 school year as it has for the current school year, operating  a more favourable pupil teacher ratio than other comparable DEIS schools while not exceeding this entitlement for the 2013/14 school year. </p></reply>

No specific terms and conditions were applied to this group of retired public servants compared to other retired public servants.</p><p>  My Department has introduced measures to minimise the recruitment of retired teachers in schools.  Schools may only employ a retired teacher where no appropriately qualified unemployed registered teacher is available.  Furthermore, retired teachers must start at the first point of the teachers salary scale and are treated as new entrants to teaching for pay purposes.  Under the Employment Control Framework for the Higher Education Sector, retired staff who are re-engaged can only be paid a maximum of 20% of their pre-retirement salary, including any salary adjustments which may have occurred since their retirement.  However, notwithstanding those provisions, there is no bar as such to retired public servants returning to public service employment.</p><p>The Centre of Excellence within Enterprise Ireland (EI) will be responsible for developing an improved environment for small and micro business and bringing this sector into the heart of national enterprise policy. It will build on the success of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) by developing new thinking and best practice with regard to supports for small and micro business and ensuring their delivery. Some of the strengths and advantages that EI will bring to the LEOs are an enhanced insight to the opportunities for development of key and emerging sectors, clusters and networks; a back-stop of technical expertise to assist in the assessment of potential investment projects and access to a central reservoir of information, benchmarking programme performance and assessing international best practice. The LEOs will be the first-stop-shop through which all information on State supports for small and micro businesses can be accessed, and where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from EI. </p><p>  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation I will retain responsibility for policy, and a key feature of this new structure will be the consistent application of policy across all LEOs, from the evaluation of applications for funding support, to the spending of budgets allocated. I will shortly be publishing a Framework Service Level Agreement that has been agreed between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities which will form the basis within which LEOs will operate in delivering enterprise supports. This includes details on the creation of the Evaluation Committees that will be established. They will include representatives from Enterprise Ireland and a number of business representatives and entrepreneurs with specific business expertise. The decision to have the County Manager, or their representative, chair the committee is in line with their responsibility in the delivery of this service on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  In addition to the publication of the SLA the national micro enterprise policy guidelines are currently being reviewed and developed and will outline how micro and small enterprises will be supported. The Deputy will be aware that I engaged in a full public consultation process and the valuable inputs received are currently helping to frame these guidelines. The current policy of supporting companies with less than ten employees that are involved in manufacturing and internationally traded services will be broadened to a situation where all micro and small businesses will be included in the first-stop-shop services of the LEO e.g. companies with greater than ten employees and those trading in the domestic market will be eligible for appropriate supports.</p></reply>

The position is that the Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches. There is also provision for the exemption of community halls which are not licensed to sell alcohol and where the facilities are not used for profit and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.</p><p>  However, the Act provides that where an organisation or club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 and is licensed to sell alcohol, all the club buildings, wherever located, are rateable in their entirety. The legislation is unambiguous in this regard and the Valuation Office has no option but to consider all such premises to be rateable. However, in all such cases exemption from rates can be achieved by the cessation of the liquor licence. </p><p>  The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and the club is competing with other commercial licensed premises in their locality, all of which are rateable. The apportionment of club premises between areas used for the sale of alcohol and those areas used for other activities could be operationally problematic and lead to anomalies in the rateability of premises licensed to sell alcohol. There are no plans to provide for special treatment of licensed clubs under the Valuation Act, which maintains the long-standing principle that all commercial activities are valued in a fair and equitable manner.  </p></reply>

This allocation supports the transition to an economy based on exports, enterprise and innovation through Capital funding to Agencies and Programmes such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards, Shannon Development, InterTrade Ireland, INTERREG, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) and the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p>The drawdown of exchequer monies through the Agencies of my Department is based on commitments made in a given year and projected draw-downs against those commitments in the year in question.  The drawdown of exchequer financial support by companies or other bodies (e.g. Competency Centres) is demand-led and can only take place if the company or body in question has progressed a given project in line with the agreement entered into with the State at the time of the financial commitment.</p><p>The pattern of disbursement of funds is essentially determined according to this demand-led nature of grant payments and issues relating to the timing of expenditure and significant drawdown occurs in the last quarter of the year.

Please note that prior to 2010, CEBs could report only on the number of jobs existing in CEB supported companies and the measurement of job creation was whether this figure had gone up or down since the previous year &ndash; CEBs assist in creating jobs every year, even those in which the overall employment figures fell.</p><p>In 2010, the CEBs&rsquo; data recording system was changed to encompass the same format as used by Forf&aacute;s, thereby enabling the CEBs to produce figures for jobs existing, job gains and job losses for the years from 2010 onwards.</p><p><bu>Table 1:  CEB

A rate of &euro;144 applies to claimants aged 22-24. The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or T&uacute;s, a higher rate of &euro;160 applies.  </p><p>  I understand that the Deputy has been contacted with regard to these measures by Focus Ireland.  My officials are in contact with Focus Ireland in relation to their concerns. While the primary issue in this regard is a housing issue rather than one of income support, the Department will continue to engage with Focus Ireland and to seek a viable solution.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">In relation to a Youth Guarantee, under my chairmanship, the Council of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers (EPSCO) last month agreed a recommendation on an EU-wide Youth Guarantee.  The EPSCO Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed.  The Recommendation will now move to be considered for formal adoption by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency - most likely in May.</font></p><p>  The scale and nature of the measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.</p></reply>

Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance.  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  </p><p>  I am not in a position to reverse the reduction to the respite care grant. The revised rate of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200. The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  </p><p>  The supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe.  A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children.  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved.  The first report of the Group, examining child and family income supports was published in February.</p><p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved.  The first report of the Group, examining child and family income supports was published in February.   This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most.  There was a strong preference in the Group for an approach based on a two-tier child and family income support payment which would encourage work participation and allow for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different family types.</p><p>  Given the range of complex issues involved, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is intended that the report will now contribute to a wider policy debate on the matter.  In considering the proposals to reform child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. </p></reply>

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.  The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing a longer-term mortgage resolution, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All relevant stakeholders will have an opportunity to input to the review.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the Agreement is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked in Ireland and who have worked or resided in Canada. The pension payments covered in the act are, old age (contributory) pensions, retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, widows (contributory) pensions.</p><p>  One of the provisions of this agreement is that certain payments payable by the authorities in one country,  can be paid even if the person concerned lives in the other country.  Without more information on the payment that this person is receiving in Canada, I cannot give a definite answer as to his entitlement to have it paid by the Canadian authorities if he moves to Ireland, but I can confirm that some disability payments can be made under this arrangement.  In addition, if a person is not entitled to the payment of a benefit because he or she has not completed sufficient reckonable periods in Ireland alone, the bilateral agreement allows for the contributions from Canada to be combined with Irish contributions.  The person's entitlement to benefit shall be determined on the basis of the totalised periods in accordance with the relevant statutory contribution conditions provided for under the legislation of Ireland.</p><p>  Finally, if the person does not qualify under either of the above arrangements, if he returns to Ireland it would be open to him to apply for a non-contributory Disability Allowance, which is means tested and subject to the habitual residence condition (HRC).  Each case is determined on its own merits, and I do not have sufficient information on the circumstances of the individual in question to give a view on whether he would qualify for Disability Allowance.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013. 646 of 17 April 2013, I outlined the eligibility criteria for rent supplement. The question referred to the provisions to support women who are leaving the family home due to domestic violence. In such cases the circumstances of the applicant are examined and the officer administering the scheme has discretionary power to expedite the award of a payment where the person&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing are at risk.  If the Deputy has concerns regarding a specific case, he should forward the details to the Department for follow up. </p></reply>

Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status. Non-fraud cases include those attributed to customer/third party error and those that are considered Departmental error. Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers come to light after their deaths.  The Department is currently not in a position to publicly comment on overpayments recorded in 2012 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However in 2011, there were a total of 63,310 overpayments amounting to &euro;92.4m.  Of these, a total of 6,062 overpayments, amounting to &euro;5.5m were the result of Departmental error.  This represents less than 6% of the total value of overpayments raised in 2011 and equates to approximately 0.03% of total scheme expenditure. </p><p>  My Department endeavours to seek the maximum level of repayments from customers in order to encourage prompt repayment of all debts.  My Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of all overpayments and they remain on a customer&rsquo;s record until fully recovered.</p></reply>

There were 68,000 young unemployed, on average, in 2012, made up of 18,500 aged 15-19 and 49,500 aged 20-24. Overall, the under-25 age group had an unemployment rate of 30% (40% for 15-19 year-olds and 28% for 20-24 year-olds). This compares to an unemployment rate of 13.5% for prime age workers (ages 25-54). Of particular concern is the continued increase in the share of youth unemployed who are out of work for more than one year. They now account for almost half of all unemployed youth (47%).<font color="#FF0000">  </font>  In this context, it is a welcome development that the most recent official labour market figures indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, showed a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier. It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.</p><p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for interim measures to support the young unemployed and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market. There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies.</p><p>In terms of education, the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme run by my Department provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated in the BTEA in the last academic year.  MOMENTUM, a new Department of Education and Skills initiative,   launched in 2013, has a specific youth component. MOMENTUM will support the provision of free education and training projects to allow 6,500 jobseekers (who are unemployed for 12 months or more) to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors. MOMENTUM consists of four themes, of which theme 4 is dedicated to under 25s. </p><p>  In terms of training, approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012 (excluding apprenticeships and evening courses). Training allowances on eligible courses exceed what a young person would receive in jobseekers' payments, providing an incentive to take up training programmes. Training courses relevant to the individual job-seeker's needs are available to all young unemployed.</p><p>  In terms of job-search assistance, some 25,500 young people registered with Employment Services in 2012, representing 36% of all new registrants.  Registering with Employment Services gives job-seekers access to guidance interviews, job search assistance, and training courses, as well as self-service job-seeking options. </p><p>  Under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP) persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to Employment Services for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.  In 2012, there were some 33,000 referrals of under 25s to the EAP, affecting approximately 26,000 individual jobseekers (those who do not attend initially are referred again). Of those referred, 68% of clients had signed off the Live Register by the end of the year. The EAP referral process is currently being replaced, under Intreo, by referral of all unemployed persons to group engagement sessions immediately on entering the Live Register, followed by immediate one-to-one interviews for those profiled as most likely to remain unemployed for longer periods.</p><p>  There are a number of schemes/programmes available that are focussed on work experience.  The most relevant for young people is JobBridge (the National Internship Scheme). Over 1,500 young people are currently participating on these schemes. The total number of placements of young people on JobBridge during 2012 was 2,700. </p><p>  In the December Budget, funding was secured for an additional 10,000 places this year across a range of programmes -- including JobBridge, T&Uacute;S and Community Employment. About a quarter of these places will be earmarked to be taken up by unemployed young people.</p><p>  Long-term unemployed youth will benefit from the JobsPlus initiative which is designed to encourage employers to recruit long-term unemployed people. Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person off the Live Register. Given that young people normally benefit most when employers start hiring, they are likely to be particular beneficiaries of this initiative.</p><p>  Finally the European Commission has proposed a Council Recommendation on a European-wide approach to a &#8220;youth guarantee. The Council Recommendation -- which received political agreement from EU employment ministers in February and is expected to be formally adopted this month -- recommends that each Member State should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed. </p><p>  While Member States are encouraged to implement the Recommendation as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems. The government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. This will include the identification of what would be the appropriate timescale for implementation in Ireland's current employment and budgetary circumstances.</p></reply>

It is of additional concern that long-term unemployment (defined as being unemployed for a year or more) accounted for 60% (176,500) of total unemployment in Q4 2012, and for almost half of all unemployment among young people.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government's primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economy recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the <b><i>Action Plan for Jobs</i></b>. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus reduce unemployment and long-term unemployment.</p><p>  In addition to promoting economic recovery, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the long-term unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. Past experience suggests that, without such measures, long-term unemployment may fall more slowly than overall unemployment when strong economic growth returns.</p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Persons from the Live Register availing of activation measures will get an opportunity to engage in employment, training and work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves. As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p><p>  In this context, the major elements of the Government's response are set out in the <b>Pathways to Work </b>policy which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created are filled by people from the Live Register, with a particular focus on those who are long term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  </p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy and the establishment of the new integrated INTREO service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment and income support services and the unemployed.  The policy is underpinned by five core strands which reflect the new integrated employment and income support services which are currently being established.  Each of these strands places the customer at the centre of all the service's activities, recognising their individual and specific needs.  The strands provide for:</p><p>- Transforming and reforming the employment and income support services institutions to deliver better services to the unemployed through an integrated approach.</p><p>- More regular and on-going engagement with people who are unemployed through active case management and profiling. There were almost 130,000 referrals of unemployed welfare recipients to the employment service in 2012.</p><p>- Greater targeting of activation places and opportunities by providing for over 85,000 places on initiatives such as Job Bridge - the National Internship Scheme, T&uacute;s, the Rural Social Scheme and the Jobs Initiative.</p><p>- Incentivising the take up of opportunities by the unemployed.</p><p>- Creating and enhancing relations with employers through incentivising the provision of opportunities for people who are unemployed.  A major initiative planned for 2013 will be JobPlus, which will streamline the existing Revenue Job Assist and Employer PRSI schemes into a single easy to administer scheme that offers an attractive incentive to employers recruiting people who are long-term unemployed.</p><p>  The Pathways to Work policy sets very ambitious targets for the long-term unemployed to be achieved over the next three years.</p><p>- To ensure that 75,000 of those long term unemployed in 2012 will move into employment by 2015.</p><p>- To reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months.</p><p>- To ensure that employers have access to and are offered suitable candidate to fill full time vacancies and that the proportion of vacancies filled by the Department's employment services from the Live Register is at least to 40% by 2015.</p><p>- To ensure that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State as a pre-condition for recipe of their welfare payments.</p><p>  In addition to the initiatives announced under the Pathways to Work programme, the Department also manages a number of schemes providing temporary employment for the long-term unemployed on works and services of value to the community. There are currently 26,000 people participating on Community Employment and T&uacute;s. As part of Budget 2013, the Government approved 10,000 new places across CE, T&Uacute;S, JobBridge and a new social employment scheme with the Local Authorities.</p><p>  The Department also supports long-term unemployed people who create jobs through self-employment. Currently, about 12,000 people are being supported under the Back to Work Allowance scheme and the Short-term Enterprise Allowance scheme.</p><p><b>Education &amp;amp; Training</b></p><p>  The Department of Social Protection also provides income support for long-term unemployment persons returning to education via Back to Education Allowance and the Springboard Scheme. There are almost 26,000 participants in receipt of Back to Education Allowance in the current academic year. Springboard offers a choice of free courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. All courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel. Participants on Springboard courses retain their social welfare payments.  Sixty-per cent of Springboard participants have been unemployed for more than twelve months and one third of those for more than 24 months. Over 3,500 people graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and an additional 6,000 places were made available for this academic year.</p><p><b>Policy Impact:</b></p><p>  The additional places being provided on a range of employment and education measures in 2013 will have a direct impact in providing opportunities for people who are currently long-term unemployed.</p><p>  While there should be an impact in improving people's probability of sustainable exit from the Live Register as a result of these measures, the impact is not immediately quantifiable. However, we do have some preliminary evaluation of a significant component of Pathways to Work - the JobBridge Internship Scheme. The findings of the interim evaluation of JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme by Indecon International Economic Consultants, published in October 2012, found that 61% of finishers secured employment within five months of completing their internship. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area and represent very significant progress in a short period of time.  Long-term unemployed made up 38% of participants covered by the evaluation.</p><p>  More generally, while it is clear that long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high, there was a noticeable reduction in the inflow into long-term duration on the live register in the 2012. For example, the number of people unemployed for between one and two years fell from almost 80,000 in early 2011 to 55,000 at the end of 2012 (which is just under 13% of the total on the Live Register). This downward trend has continued in the first quarter of 2013, so that the size of this group looks set to fall below 50,000 by the end of the year.  However, many of those who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 &amp;amp; 2010 have found it particularly difficult to find employment, with those on the Live Register for more than two years accounting for 32% (135,000) of all live registrants in March 2013. They are now a priority group for activation measures.</p></reply>

This represents a 9% decrease from twelve months previously when there were 72,953 young people signing on.  One in three young people (35%) on the Live Register had been signing on continuously for more than a year, which is similar to the proportion twelve months previously (36%).</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s policies in relation to youth unemployment are set out in reply to a separate question from the Deputy for answer today (Ref no.19401-13).</p><p>  The most recently published official forecasts are that the overall unemployment rate is expected to fall to 13% by the end of 2015, which would imply a youth unemployment rate of 25-27% as compared with an average of 30% in 2012. The most recent trends suggest that the outcome is likely to be somewhat more favourable than these projections. It is to be expected that any favourable trends in youth unemployment will be reflected in further reductions in the number of young people on the Live Register.</p></reply>

They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  While the overall number of thatch roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, legislative protection and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has assisted with the stabilisation of this decline.</p><p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  There is currently a number of State financial supports providing for the conservation and restoration of heritage structures in general, or specifically aimed at thatched structures.  In 2012, my Department provided &euro;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a <i>Structures at Risk Fund </i> administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts which are at significant risk of deterioration.  This funding assisted in the conservation of two thatched structures.  This fund will operate again in 2013 with today (24 April, 2013) being the closing date for receipt of applications by my Department from local authorities under the scheme.</p><p>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, grant-aided the restoration of twenty-three thatched structures under their Heritage Management Scheme in 2012.  In addition, the Heritage Council, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, also administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings, known as the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme.  Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings, including roofs.  It will be a matter for the Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports in 2013 and future years having regard to competing priorities for limited resources. </p><p>  I am advised that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government also administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses.</p><p>I understand, from applications for grant aid submitted to my Department, that the cost of re-thatching can vary considerably depending on a number of property specific factors.  As part of the Advice Series for owners of historic buildings, my Department plans to publish guidance on the maintenance and repair of thatch in 2013, which will include further practical advice for owners and practitioners. This will be available on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

Intensive discussions are being progressed by my Department and its UK counterpart on this matter.  Whilst the signing of the MOU indicates a strong statement of intent on the part of both Governments, considerable work remains to be done to put the necessary comprehensive framework in place.  This would be necessary in advance of any specific project being implemented and any such project will be subject to all appropriate statutory consents.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has no statutory responsibility in this regard and also has no regulatory role in the area or in relation to noise control.</p><p>  More generally, a technical review of the Wind Energy Guidelines is being overseen by officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, my Department and the SEAI.  This review will be completed later this year.  SEAI has been commissioned to conduct a targeted study of certain aspects of the Wind Energy Guidelines 2006.  This study will examine the manner in which the guidelines address key issues of community concern such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker.  The study will be one input into the review of the Wind Energy Guidelines.  I have no doubt that SEAI will discharge this work in a fully objective manner.</p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency is an independent public body operating under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and issues concerning its remit are in the first instance a matter for the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Finally, the appointments of the Chair and Directors to the Board of SEAI are made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sustainable Energy Act 2002.

Over the past two years the retrofitting measure focussed on improvement works with the objective of returning as many vacant units as possible to productive use. Over that period some &euro;52.5 million was recouped to local authorities in respect of improvements carried out to 4,774 dwellings.   </p><p>  In 2013 I am targeting grants at those older houses and apartments which lack adequate insulation and draught proofing. Local authorities have been advised to pay particular attention to dwellings which accommodate older people and people with disabilities. </p><p>  The retrofitting programme offers a very practical and cost-effective way for local authorities to improve the standard of their housing stock.

It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge.</p><p>The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.

Therefore, in assembling the table, the figure for the number of waivers for some dates has been estimated by the Agency using the closest available date for which waiver figures are recorded.

The statutory certificates of completion underpinning the procedures outlined must be signed by a registered professional i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors maintained in accordance with parts 3 and 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007 or on the register of chartered engineers established under the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969. </p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate. It is open to persons, including members of the Architect&rsquo;s Alliance of Ireland, the Group of Independent Architects of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors as established under Part 3 and Part 5 respectively of the Building Control Act 2007. Inclusion on either register will enable a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the new regulations when they come into effect on and from 1 March 2014.</p><p>  It is my understanding that architectural technologists have already successfully sought inclusion on both registers. I have recently asked Mr. Garrett Fennell, Solicitor, who is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Admissions Board relevant to the register of Architects, to carry out an independent review of the experience to date in relation to the operation of the register with a view to identifying any further improvements that can be made at this point.  The terms of reference for the review specifically address the matter of how the registration of practically trained architects can be further encouraged and I look forward to any recommendations and views the review report may offer in this regard in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a rateable property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for payment of rates. However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, namely, where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. In most rating authorities, 100% of the amount paid is refundable to the owner.</p><p>  Should an occupier commence his or her occupation of rateable premises after the date of the making of the rate in any given year, that person would not normally be primarily liable for rates for that year.  I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I am continuing to keep all matters relating to commercial  rates under regular review.</p></reply>

The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution. </p><p>  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial.

A comprehensive new sanctions regime for the enforcement of these standards is also available to local authorities following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.

Application fees for the three personal insolvency arrangements have yet to be determined by the ISI. Therefore, at the present time it is not possible to indicate what revenue may be generated by the Service in this regard. The ISI will also generate revenue from application fees which will be charged to persons wishing to become Personal Insolvency Practitioners (PIPs). However, at this stage it cannot be estimated how many persons will apply for that role and how many will actually be authorised to practice.</p><p>  Under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, Approved Intermediaries cannot charge a debtor a fee in connection with Debt Relief Notice applications.  In the case of processing Debt Settlement Arrangements (DSAs) and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) it will be the role of the PIP to negotiate their fees on a case by case basis. PIPs fees will be subject to creditors approval and will be paid from the debtor's contribution to the arrangement. I am advised by the ISI that it is not possible at the present time to indicate with accuracy what revenue may be generated by this business sector.</p></reply>

The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.</p><p>  The current average processing time for applications is approximately 12 weeks from date of receipt.   However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.</p><p>  Following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, sanction was granted for an additional 25 staff to be re-deployed from the Department of Agriculture to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  I am pleased to announce that these personnel transferred to the GCVU on 22 April 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.  Since I became Minister, it has been a priority for me that processing times should be kept to a minimum consistent with maintaining the overall integrity of the vetting system.

In determining an application for the opening of an insolvency proceeding, listed in the Annex to the Regulation, for which it would have exclusive power as the primary proceedings of a company or of a natural person, the Regulation requires that a court should determine the centre of main interest of the applicant in the context of  assuming jurisdiction. </p><p>  Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, Member States recognise bankruptcies in other Member States where the centre of main interest of the debtor is determined to be within that Member State.</p><p>  The European Commission in December, 2012 published a proposal to modernise cross-border insolvency law which seeks to make cross-border insolvency proceedings more efficient, benefiting both debtors and creditors throughout the EU.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and the Commission took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law. </p><p>  In England and Wales, for example, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high. Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012. Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment. </p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts only as a last resort. This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation, and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department. </p><p>  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance. In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed, i.e., whether an easement of light or otherwise, and that there had been a substantial interference with that right. </p><p>  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.

Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 31st October, 2000, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. While written representations were submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned, no final decision was made in the case at that time.</p><p>  Given that there was no further contact from or on behalf of the person concerned for some considerable time, processing of his case was put on hold. However, his case file was re-activated in May, 2008 when correspondence was received from his then legal representative indicating that further representations would follow soon after. However, no further representations were submitted at that time or indeed since.</p><p>  The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  Any representations on file will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there is no basis for the making of any form of an interim decision in this, or indeed any other, case and, as such, the Deputy and the person concerned should await a substantive decision, of the nature described above, being made.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  </p><p>  Parents qualify for support under the CCS programme on the basis of their social welfare entitlement.

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services.  The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme.  The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation.  The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

It aims to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and is lead by Cosc which is the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The HSE subsequently published its own Policy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.  The principal actions are in line with the National Strategy.  The HSE&rsquo;s policy states that a health-focused analysis of violence is crucial, not only because the consequences of such violence require a significant amount of healthcare system resources, but most importantly because the health care system is often the first route through which victims seek to access supports.  Nationally the HSE funds 42 frontline domestic violence service providers.  20 of these provide refuge accommodation and this number has risen from 15 since 2000.  The services provide a wide range of supports such as crisis refuge, advocacy and counselling and were funded to the amount of &euro;13.465 Million in 2012.  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Ireland's primary interaction is with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The payment made in any one year is based on an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  Payment is made following discussions and agreement between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete.  Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year.  Ireland has had waiver and bilateral agreements with many member states whereby such costs are mutually waived.  Some of these agreements have been terminated in recent years.  In view of this and of the increased numbers availing of services since the EU was expanded the HSE is putting in place measures to enable it to commence the issuing of claims for reimbursement of costs to the relevant competent states in the future.</p></reply>

The drugs and medicines are actually purchased by community pharmacists who are in turn recouped by the HSE.  As the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacists with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of bulk purchasing envisaged by the Deputy.</p><p>  In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including:</p><p> - significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p> - a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p> - timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p> - reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. Under this Agreement, from 1 November 2012, the HSE will only reimburse generic products which have been priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. In the event that an originator medicine is priced at less than 50% of its initial price the HSE will require a generic price to be priced below the originator price. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate.</p><p>  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is scheduled for Report Stage today, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria:</p><p> - the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item;</p><p> - the value for money afforded by the relevant item;</p><p> - the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed;</p><p> - the prices of therapeutically similar items; and </p><p> - the resources available to the HSE.</p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p></reply>

I am advised that, in 2012, ninety cochlear implants were carried out with 42 children receiving implants and 48 adults.  In addition to providing the surgical services, the programme provides a comprehensive assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those actually implanted.</p><p>  In 2009 a National Review of Audiology Services was carried out by the HSE, to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. The report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the HSE in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, from new-born screening to assessment and management of adults and children with hearing problems, including cochlear implantation.  Two of the main recommendations in the report include the national rollout of a universal new-born hearing screening programme and the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme. The report also included a recommendation that continued ring-fenced financial support be provided for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. </p><p>  The HSE is working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for both simultaneous and sequential bilateral implantation. The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. It provides funding, maintains health information systems, and conducts research linked to national health priorities. The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity, and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.</p><p>  The Health Research Board strategy supports three broad research areas: - </p><p>  -	applied biomedical and clinical research</p><p>  -	population health sciences research</p><p>  -	health services research</p><p>  Within these areas the HRB  funds a range of scheme types from PhD scholars programmes, through post-doctoral and health professional fellowships to larger programme awards and support for infrastructure. </p><p>  The HRB does not ring-fence funding for any particular type of disease or disorder. It does not exclude any field of health research once it meets the HRB's criteria .</p><p>  Applications for HRB funding derive from bottom-up, open, competitive calls. This means that the idea for the research topic, whether it is for a particular disease area or linked to health services delivery, comes from the researcher. All proposals are evaluated by rigorous international peer review which focuses on the quality of the proposal, track record of the applicant, quality of the research environment, as well as potential outcomes and impacts. This process is very important for ensuring independence and maintaining high standards in the research that the HRB funds. Research proposals deemed to be excellent and in line with the HRB's strategic areas are ranked and matched against the available budget. </p><p>  The HRB has developed a  co-funding arrangement with the Medical Research Charities Group( MRCG) , whereby it can support research into rare diseases and disorders.  Each year the MRCG invites proposals for research in diseases and disorders of interest to its members and the HRB manages the rigorous evaluation of these applications through its peer review process to ensure their quality. This partnership commits over &euro;2M in funding each year to this scheme. </p></reply>

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive the service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.</p><p>  It is well recognised that the Rotunda Hospital provides leadership in maternity services obstetrics, midwifery, neonatology and gynaecology services to all of north Dublin and the northeast.  Strong clinical links with the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, including joint consultant appointments, are a fundamental support to the work of the Rotunda, and this will continue in any configuration in which the Rotunda is required to operate. It is neither intended nor anticipated that the Rotunda will be constrained by being positioned within a particular group.  As well as its long standing links with the Mater, which can and should be retained, it would also be appropriate for the Rotunda to establish links with other hospitals to meet its future aspirations for sub-specialty development and to expand and consolidate the links which currently exist.</p><p>  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin, which was completed in 2008, noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. The intention has been that the National Maternity Hospital should be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this. There will be early discussions with the maternity hospitals regarding their maternity /adult co-location plans in the context of the Government decision to build the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James&rsquo;s campus.  Notwithstanding this, I am committed to the intent of the report - that the Dublin maternity hospitals be located alongside adult acute services - while also bearing in mind the  need to plan for the provision of tri-located paediatric , adult and maternity services, as is the intention in relation to the new children's hospital.</p></reply>
