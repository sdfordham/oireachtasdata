    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500048#WRA00600"><p>The objective of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support sustainable job creation by creating the operating conditions where more businesses can start-up and grow.</p><p>  The increase in total employment of 42,700 in the year to Q1 2014 was made up of an increase in full-time employment of 46,400 (+3.3%) while part-time employment declined by 3,700 (-0.8%). This is in sharp contrast to the rest of the EU where there has been steady growth in the number of employees working part-time and the number of fulltime workers has continued to fall.</p><p>  Much of our jobs growth is in sectors which we have targeted in the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, Accommodation and Food Services, and Industry.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, which was published at the end of February, contains 385 discrete actions across a wide range of sectors to support competitiveness and job creation.</p><p>  The efforts of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are geared to creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment and this is reflected in their employment trends. Jobs Plus, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s employer incentive scheme, has helped recruit 2,115 long-term unemployed jobseekers from the Live Register to fill full-time positions since its introduction last July, and is deliberately designed to encourage employers to provide full time jobs.</p><p>  The change reflected in the reduction of part-time employment relative to the increase in permanent and/or full-time contracts in Ireland contrasts with the position at EU aggregate level.  While full time employment is the focus of our policy efforts, I recognise that in Ireland as indeed throughout Europe, temporary and part-time jobs are a contribution to job creation since in the medium to long run they may act as a stepping stone to permanent and/or full-time contracts.</p><p>  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about the way in which zero hour contracts can operate.  I have, on previous occasions, pointed out that the manner in which these contracts are regulated in Ireland differs from the position in the United Kingdom, where they have generated greater controversy. In particular, workers engaged under mutually agreed zero hour contracts in Ireland are entitled to compensation where shifts for zero-hours workers are cancelled at short notice.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500048#WRA00800"><p>I am glad to say that the numbers employed in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, has steadily increased in the three year period 2011 to 2013 inclusive. Total employment in IDA Ireland companies (including companies that were formerly clients of Shannon Development) has risen from 146,419 at end 2010 to 166,184 at end 2013, while total job numbers in Enterprise Ireland client companies rose from 166,890 at end 2010 to 175,750 at end 2013. This increase of 19,715  and 8,860 respectively is in sharp contrast to  the previous three year period from end 2007 to end 2010 when job numbers declined by  41,985 (16,800 in IDA Ireland client companies and 25,185 in Enterprise Ireland client companies).</p><p>  In relation to employment in the economy as a whole the latest CSO Quarterly National Household Survey showed that the number of people in employment at Q1 2014 stood at 1.903 million, an increase of over 65,000 in the numbers at work in the last two years. This performance in employment growth is better than anywhere in the OECD.</p><p>  In addition, my Department has reformed the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises by creating the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) within the Local Authority structure. This reform will help to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level.  All 31 LEOs opened for business on 15th  April.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises. My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops. The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p><p>  Under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines, which will enter into force on 1 July 2014, areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population will now be eligible for assistance.  This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map. Aid intensity rates were also maintained at their current levels.</p><p>  It is an acknowledged fact that since 2000 there has been a decline in the manufacturing sector in most developed economies including Ireland.  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy on Manufacturing, which I commissioned and which was launched in April 2013, identified that a total of 205,700 people were directly employed in Manufacturing and that a similar number of jobs were indirectly supported.  At the end of 2013, Central Statistics Office Data (Quarterly National Household Survey, Q 4 2013) shows that a total of 215,900 were directly employed in the sector, a rise of 10,200 on that earlier figure.  When indirect jobs are taken into account, the position is that the Manufacturing sector supports over 430,000 jobs (end 2013).  My agencies are now rolling out actions aimed at sustained growth in manufacturing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500048#WRA01000"><p>Firstly, I should point out that the company concerned is not a client of Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the agency is working with client companies in the printing sector committed to diversifying their operations into new technologies such as digital print (to offer short runs, economical and quicker turnaround, personalisation) and fulfilment/packaging services for target markets. Such growth areas include the medtech, pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, as well as electronic consumer and software customers. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is actively engaged with in excess of 100 companies in the print and packaging sector, and has supported development in these companies through its Market Access, Job Expansion, R&amp;amp;D grants and Exploring Opportunities programmes.</p><p>  The ongoing move from print to web for traditionally printed items has resulted in a significant decline in market print volume.  Print companies that have successfully moved their business to focus on solutions, that include print, are growing both domestically and internationally.  Print companies targeting sectors that developed niche or differentiated products are growing in turnover, export sales and employment.  There is a need to innovate with respect to product, services and business within the print sector because of decline in large volume printing.  </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to support clients, through the Lean Programme targeting improved efficiencies, enabling companies address margin issues in a very competitive market.  There is also a need to adopt new products, services and business models to develop new revenue streams with the volume of general print declining.  Print will continue to move towards a low cost service and differentiation of core customer offer will be essential to the development of a sustainable sub-sector.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland also:</p><p>  -	continues to work with companies seeking changes to their business models, market requirements and technology through its R&amp;amp;D programmes; and</p><p>  -	promotes Management Training to better position client companies to meet the challenges of the sector. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland promotes opportunities within the Public Procurement landscape. The most recent initiative was to invite consortia including print companies to develop solutions for the State Examinations Commission to move towards an on-line marking system while maintaining student experience. The aim is to improve capability and move towards higher value service offer which involves print services. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is committed to engaging with their client base in the printing sector as a third party in discussions with the banking sector.  This is done in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Banking Relations Unit and the Sectoral team.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500048#WRA01200"><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to develop a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. A report on the potential of social enterprises to create jobs and to identify the actions required by Government and other relevant bodies and agencies, was commissioned and produced by Forf&aacute;s in July 2013.</p><p>The Forf&aacute;s report recommended the establishment of an inter-departmental group to develop and champion the sector.  The group was established in October 2013 and is chaired by Minister Sean Sherlock. The function of this group is to provide a coordinated approach from the Government sector to support the development of social enterprise in Ireland, to develop a policy framework for the provision of these supports and to examine the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report in greater detail with a view to their implementation. The Group also formally engages with the Social Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Task Force (SEETF), as the best representative group of the sector to progress the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report.  Since October 2013, The Group has met on five occasions. Immediate actions required were identified and a   <font color="#2F2F2F">small joint working-group was also established to prepare a work-plan based on short, medium and long-term goals. </font></p><p>The  recommendations being examined by the group cover the areas of Policy Development, Capacity Building, Procurement, Funding and Finance, Developing Leaders, Harnessing Community Support and, Governance.</p><p>At the outset it must be acknowledged that the Social Enterprise umbrella covers a disparate sector. The spectrum ranges from enterprises that are fully supported by the State through to a small number of commercially trading companies. Therefore mapping the sector and identifying the supports required is a challenge for policy makers. </p><p>Notwithstanding, a number of actions have been identified and are being progressed:</p><p>-Inclusion of support for social enterprises in the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will be effective from January 2015.</p><p>-New Local Enterprise Offices have been established and will act as the first-stop-shop and sign-posting service to any enterprise that is commercially viable and meets the eligibility criteria set down by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation.</p><p>-The group is exploring mechanisms to develop capacity in the sector and examine how best to access EU funds e.g. the new EU Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme has a Microfinance and Social Entrepreneurship axis dedicated to support for access to micro-finance and social entrepreneurship.</p><p>-Discussions with the Central Statistics Office have taken place on the inclusion of Social Enterprise in CSO data collection. The Group have also engaged with representatives from Credit Unions to discuss supports for Social Enterprises.</p><p>-Initial contact has also taken place with the office of Public Procurement to examine the scope for inclusion of Social Impact Clauses in Public Procurement.</p></reply>

They also provided NERA&rsquo;s contact details should the employees need further information about these matters. NERA officials have also met with a representative of the employer and provided information on the employer&rsquo;s obligations and the rights of the employees. </p><p>  Irish employment rights legislation provides a comprehensive range of protections for employees. In this particular case, there may be several possible avenues of redress for the employees to consider, including, for example, making a complaint to a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages Act for unpaid wages and bringing a claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) where the employer fails to comply with redundancy payment/minimum notice obligations. </p><p>  The administration of the Redundancy Payments legislation is within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, who has advised that it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees. Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that he/she is unable to pay statutory redundancy to his/her eligible employees that Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees. Such payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund and result in a debt being raised against the employer which the Department of Social Protection will seek to recover.</p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent (liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy etc.) and, as a result, defaults on payment of wages and other entitlements, an employee may also be entitled to seek redress from the State under the Insolvency Payments Scheme.  These payments also cover overtime, holiday pay, sick pay etc. In these circumstances, redundancy payment entitlements may also be made from the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  I have been informed by the Minister for Social Protection that she has received no applications for redundancy payments or insolvency payments in respect of the employees of this company. </p><p>  A company may be put into liquidation by its members. An alternative is that the company&rsquo;s creditors may apply to the Courts to have the company put into liquidation. Employees owed wages or other payments count as creditors and would be entitled to have the company put into liquidation.</p><p>  There have been a number of instances where employers have ceased trading but have not gone through a formal wind-up process even though it would appear that the business is insolvent (so called &ldquo;informal&rdquo; insolvencies). At present the former employees of such employers are not covered by the insolvency payments scheme as their former employers do not satisfy the definition of insolvency for the purpose of the scheme. The position with regard to these situations is currently under review by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Finally, I would remind the parties involved in the current situation that all of the relevant agencies and bodies under the remit of my Department remain available, should this be of assistance.</p></reply>

The system that developed over the last eighty years had become unwieldy and complex and was no longer fit for purpose. Indeed, there was universal acceptance of the need for a root-and-branch reform of the existing structures.</p><p>  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</p><p>  Significant progress has been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, insofar as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme are concerned, including the following measures which have already been put in place:</p><p>  -	Transfer of the Equality Tribunal into my Department to be part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC),</p><p>  -	Establishment of a Single Contact Portal (Workplace Relations Customer Service),</p><p>  -	Launch of a single Workplace Relations Complaint Form and e-complaint facility,</p><p>  -	Finalisation of a Staffing and Structures Plan, </p><p>  -	Design and launch of a single Workplace Relations website, </p><p>  -	Design and launch of a Single Adjudication and Appeals Decisions Database,</p><p>  -	Establishment of an Early Resolution Service, </p><p>  -	Finalisation of Adjudicator training and recruitment plans, and </p><p>  -	Implementation of enhanced technologies and business processes, including the completion of the procurement phase in relation to the design and commissioning of a Customer Relationship Management Solution.</p><p>  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes. The Draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting. The drafting of the legislation is at an advanced stage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I anticipate it will be completed to allow me publish the Bill during the current Spring/Summer Dail session with a view to having the new structures in place during 2014.</p><p>  The legislation will provide for the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to come together under the remit of the WRC.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.</p><p>  A key priority in this Reform Programme is to improve access to the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services and the reforms that I am introducing will provide for an improved service in terms of cost efficiency and user-friendliness for the users of the services.   </p><p>  In this regard, I do not propose to introduce charges on parties for access to the WRC services for many reasons, chief amongst which is the belief that &lsquo;forum shopping&rsquo; will not be a feature in the new system. However, I am proposing the introduction of a fee in one particular instance: i.e. where a party who failed to appear at a first instance hearing of the WRC without good cause wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court, that party will have to pay a fee of &euro;300 when lodging their appeal. If the Labour Court determines that the party in question had good cause for failing to attend the first instance hearing, the fee will be refunded. To facilitate this, a statutory basis will be provided in the legislation for the introduction of fees.  This will also provide for any future situation where it is deemed appropriate and necessary to introduce fees.</p></reply>

At the end of 2013, Central Statistics Office Data (Quarterly National Household Survey, Q 4 2013) shows that a total of 215,900 were directly employed in the sector, a rise of 10,200 on that earlier figure.  When account is taken of indirect jobs, the position is that the Manufacturing sector supports over 430,000 jobs (end 2013).  </p><p>  Overall, steady progress is being made towards reaching the target of 20,000 new jobs by 2016 which the Government has set in relation to job creation potential in the Manufacturing sector.  I believe that the positive employment trends seen in recent years in the sector can be further built on by focusing policy on developing Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in key, high-value manufacturing areas. This will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and help create good quality, sustainable jobs in Manufacturing.</p></reply>

This guidance makes provision for the notification of all pensioners in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances a pensioner will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.</p><p>  It is important to note that the trustees of a pension scheme are required to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis, the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members in any restructuring proposals they make.</p><p>  The question of whether it is appropriate that pensioner groups have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is under consideration.</p><p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Social Protections have held discussions to explore the issue of retired persons&rsquo; collective representation with the Trustees of the Pension Schemes of which they are members and, perhaps more problematically, with former employers where changes to the scheme are being negotiated between employers and employees that may impact on retired persons. </p><p>  My Officials have also consulted with the industrial relations bodies under the auspices of my Department on the issues that arise in the context of collective representation of retired and deferred members of pension schemes in such circumstances. </p><p>  In this context, issues that need to be considered include;</p><p>  -	the relationship, if any, between pensioners or deferred pensioners and their former employer.

Drawing on data from 176 countries, the UN Population Fund reported significant achievements. </p><p>  Today, fewer women are dying in pregnancy and childbirth. Worldwide, maternal mortality, while still at an unacceptably high level, fell by nearly half between 1990 and 2010.  More women now have access to education, work and political participation. More children, girls in particular, are going to school; primary school enrolment rates are now approaching 90%.   Nearly 1 billion people have moved out of extreme poverty.</p><p>  However, progress remains uneven and fragmented. In the poorest communities, women&rsquo;s status, maternal mortality, and rates of child marriage, have seen too little progress over the past two decades. Every day, some 800 women will die giving birth.  Worldwide, one in three women report having experienced physical and/or sexual abuse. In developing countries, one in three girls are married before the age of 18, with serious consequences for their opportunities for a better life. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s development policy contains an explicit commitment to the Cairo Programme of Action, through efforts that reduce maternal and infant mortality and promote universal access to reproductive healthcare, including ante-natal care and family planning services. We are committed to playing a full and active role in ensuring that the ICPD Programme of Action is fully reflected in the global development framework to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), after 2015.</p><p>  During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU Council last year, we negotiated Council Conclusions which provided a strong EU voice for the Post 2015 Framework, including supporting the full and effective implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. Ireland and South Africa co-facilitated the MDG Special Event in September 2013 which endorsed a strong outcome document.  It provides a clear commitment to maximising progress under the MDGs and a roadmap for the negotiation of a new global development framework post-2015.  Since last year, Ireland has been actively engaged in the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations which is the main intergovernmental forum tasked with developing recommendations on the Post 2015 framework.  We will continue these efforts over the coming year to ensure that the ICPD commitments are at the heart of a new development framework.</p></reply>

My Department has consulted with the Pakistani authorities and based on these contacts, it appears that the authorities in Pakistan are taking measures to bring those responsible to justice. We understand two separate investigations have been launched into the circumstances of the violent death of Ms Farzana Parveen. The first was initiated at the behest of the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif.  As part of this investigation, a number of suspects have already been arrested and charged including members of the victim&rsquo;s family.  Prosecution of the case will be conducted using anti-terrorism legislation, which is designed to facilitate a prompt trial.  A second investigation was also launched on the initiative of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Lahore.  He ordered the Attorney General to report to him within 48 hours about the facts and circumstances of the death of Ms Farzana Parveen.   Ireland considers that it is of the utmost importance that all those implicated in this heinous crime are brought to justice. It is also important that Pakistan, as a State Party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), takes appropriate action to prevent such killings in the future and end all forms of violence against women. </p></reply>

I continue to stress the importance of progressing implementation of all outstanding aspects of the Agreements in my ongoing contacts with the British government, and with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p><p>I welcome the report agreed at the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary in Dublin on 31 March 2014<b></b>on the implementation of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreement and which calls on all parties to the Agreements &lsquo;<i>to maintain momentum to ensure that all outstanding provisions are implemented in their totality</i>&rsquo;.  </p><p>I support the establishment of a North/South Consultative Civic Forum which would provide for a broad range of voices on community relations and stimulate informed public debate in relation to key societal challenges.  The Government has continued to express support for such a body, including at the November 2013 North South Ministerial Council.  On my regular visits to Northern Ireland, I continue the practice of engaging with civil society representatives.  Officials of my Department are maintaining their efforts to achieve progress on this issue. </p><p>I am firmly of the view that an Irish Language Act should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity in Northern Ireland.  </p><p>Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland has been a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and in particular the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms. Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.   </p><p>I will continue to press in my discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive and with the British Government the urgent need to address this issue and to legislate for an Irish Language Act.  </p><p>I continue to urge all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.</p><p>A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights underpinning a reconciled society in Northern Ireland. I, and my officials, will continue to engage with counterparts in the British Government and in the Northern Ireland Executive on this matter. </p></reply>

On 6 May, I met with survivors and families of the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and with <i>Justice for the Forgotten</i>and confirmed the Government&rsquo;s ongoing support for their campaign.  At that meeting, I announced funding of &euro;48,000 for <i>Justice for the Forgotten</i>, which now operates as a project of the Pat Finucane Centre, which will be disbursed through the Reconciliation Fund operated by my Department.  The Taoiseach and Minister of State Costello participated in a memorial event which took place on Talbot Street on 17 May and I was represented at a wreath-laying ceremony in Monaghan on 18 May by an official from my Department. I welcome the continued all-party support for their campaign on behalf of the Dublin/Monaghan families.</p><p>The Taoiseach and I have reiterated our support for the all-party D&aacute;il motions of July 2008 and May 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the bombings.</p><p>I raised the issue of the British Government granting access to these documents when I met with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers in Dublin last week. She assured me that she will reflect afresh on what the British Government can do to respond.

While the precise type of vehicle is not disclosed, it is assumed that it is a van as defined in the benefit  in-kind legislation. Generally speaking, the use of a van by an employee or director to travel between places of work is considered to be business rather than private use of the vehicle.  This is on the basis that the expense associated with such travel is incurred necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment.</p><p>Whether a journey is undertaken in the performance of the duties of an employment depends on the particular facts of the case. So, while as a general rule travel between the registered office of a company and a client's premises would be a business journey, this need not always be the case.  For example, if the registered office of the company was also the home of the employee, the travel will generally have a private purpose, i.e. that of travelling to and from home.   The fact that the vehicle is used to carry tools does not change the purpose of the journey or make it business use. </p><p>For the sake of completeness I should add that no taxable benefit will arise in respect of the private use of company van where all of the following conditions are met:</p><p>-the van is supplied by the employer to the employee for the purposes of the employee's work</p><p>-the employee is required by the employer to bring the van home after work</p><p>-apart from travelling from work to home and back to work, other private use of the van by the employee is forbidden by the employer, and there is <b>in fact</b>no other private use</p><p>-in the course of his or her work, the employee spends at least 80% of his or her time away from the premises of the employer to which he or she is attached.</p><p>This exemption applies to company vans only. There are specific criteria for determining what constitutes a van for the purposes of the benefit-in-kind legislation. These are set out in detail on the Revenue website at .  </p><p>No taxable benefit will arise in respect of the private use of a commercial vehicle with a gross vehicle weight (i.e. gross laden weight) in excess of 3,500kg.</p><p>Finally, I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has been in continuing written correspondence with his Revenue district.  He has been offered a review of the handling of his case under Revenue's Complaint and Review Procedures.  He has raised some queries regarding the conduct of the review, which are being dealt with in correspondence with him.   He has also been invited to meet with officials in order to clarify matters in his own case, but he has not yet availed of this opportunity.  In this respect, I would invite him to contact Mr Eoin &Oacute; Domhnaill at 021-6027225.</p></reply>

The Plan priorities new school building projects as well as major extensions in areas where significant demographic need has been established so that our school system is in a position to cater for increasing pupil numbers. Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department has also published a detailed annual programme of the major school building projects to commence construction in each of the years  2012, 2013 and 2014. The 5 Year Plan, together with each of the annual programmes concerned, may also be viewed on my Department's website.</p><p>  Given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, to meet future demand will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.

Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities, e.g. pitches are provided, where appropriate, and in the context of available resources, as part of the Department's school building programme.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. Priority is currently being given to applications for essential mainstream classroom accommodation in areas of significant demographic growth and where additional teaching staff have been allocated. This will continue to be the main focus for investment by my Department in the coming years. Accordingly whilst my Department will continue to provide additional and improved classroom accommodation in our schools, it is not currently in a position within available funding to consider applications from schools for the addition of a general purpose room.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule includes the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for September 2014. The school referred to by the Deputy would need to be projecting an enrolment of 93 pupils to meet this criterion.In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

This Circular clarifies and restates the purpose of the SNA scheme which is  to provide schools with additional support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.</p><p>In June 2011, my Department published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.</p><p>Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.</p><p>My Department accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above. The circular therefore should not be interpreted as a means to reduce the numbers of SNAs in schools.</p><p>At present all SNA allocations are reviewed annually. The circular restates this practice. It should also not be assumed that any such review will automatically lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.</p><p>The Circular acknowledges that many pupils will have care needs which may remain constant. However, the Circular makes clear that whereas supports may be reduced to ensure that pupils who have diminishing care needs can be afforded an opportunity to develop independent living skills, that SNA supports will continue to be provided for those pupils who have ongoing care needs.</p><p>The Circular provides details of the primary care needs for which SNA support will usually be provided and details the types of secondary care associated tasks which SNAs may often perform. The circular has not materially altered the definition of care needs but has clarified the care needs for which SNA support should be provided.</p><p>The circular clarifies the role of the Classroom Teacher and Resource/Learning Support Teachers to provide for the education of a child, and the role of an SNA to support those teachers in assisting with care needs. The role that professional reports play in supporting the SNA scheme is also set out. </p><p>The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupils disability categorisation.</p><p>It is considered that this Circular will provide useful guidance and support for schools and parents in clarifying the purpose of the scheme and setting out the circumstances in which SNA support will normally be provided to assist children with special educational needs to access education.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the 2014/15 school year (Circular 0007/2014) were published on 24 January, 2014. The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.</p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less. The first phase of the budget measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure takes effect from September 2014. </p><p>  My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure. In this regard small schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has submitted an application to the Appeals Board under Criterion A - Exceptional accommodation difficulties for the next meeting on the 10th June 2014. The school will be notified of the outcome of its appeal in due course.</p></reply>

However, I understand that the CSO does not compile statistics on jobs created and lost on a county basis.  </p><p>As far as agencies of my Department are concerned, the number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (formerly CEBs), in the past five years are set out in the following Tables, 1, 2 and 3.  (Prior to 2010, the CEBs could only report on the number of jobs existing in CEB-supported companies.  In 2010, the CEBs&rsquo; data recording system was changed, thereby enabling them to produce figures for jobs existing, job gains and job losses for the years from 2010 onwards.)</p><p>As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I introduced a collaborative, cross- government approach to advancing job creation in the State.  The Action Plan for Jobs is an annual plan designed to drive action across all Government Departments and Agencies in a collective effort to put in place the conditions needed to support and grow employment in the State.</p><p>This Government has set an ambitious target of adding 100,000 net new jobs by 2016 on a path to having 2.1 million people employed in the economy by 2020.  </p><p>In the year to Q1 2014, there was an annual increase in employment of 2.3% or 42,700 jobs in the economy, bringing total employment to 1,888,200.</p><p>I was pleased to note that the long-term unemployment rate decreased from 8.4% to 7.3% over the year to Q1 2014.  Long-term unemployment accounted for 60.5% of total unemployment in Q1 2014, compared with 61.8% last year, and 63.5% in the first quarter of 2012.  In the same period, youth unemployment decreased from 26.7% to 25.3%.  These figures are very encouraging and show that the Government's Action Plan for Jobs process is working and getting people back to work.</p><p>The Government also specifically continues to address the alleviation of youth unemployment through the combined strategies of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  The objective of Pathways to Work &ndash; which has a particular focus on supporting those who are unemployed - is to ensure that as many jobs as possible are filled by people from the Live Register. </p><p>There are a number of actions in both the Action Plan and Pathways to Work which are targeted at, or amenable to, younger people. These include the JobBridge internship programme, the JobPlus initiative, the Youth Guarantee, the Momentum and Springboard training courses, and the ICT Action Plan.  These initiatives are collectively delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government is also increasing the number of training places available for young people this year.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s support is targeted primarily at exporting companies, delivered by working directly with businesses, and the research and investment communities to build sustainable competitive advantage for our economy and assist companies in achieving success in global markets.  Assistance is available from Enterprise Ireland for all stages of company development from, for example, small projects under the Innovation Voucher Scheme to larger projects under the Innovation Partnership Scheme and the R&amp;amp;D Fund. Over the last five years, Enterprise Ireland has made payments of &euro;199 million to companies in respect of a range of direct research and innovation activities as follows: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Total R&amp;amp;D Payments*</td><td>&euro;51m</td><td>&euro;49m</td><td>&euro;35m</td><td>&euro;32m</td><td>&euro;32m</td></tr></table></p><p>*The reduction in R&amp;amp;D payments over the period 2009 &ndash; 2013 is due mainly to the impact of the recession. </p><p>In addition to the direct supports for research and innovation activities Enterprise Ireland also funds industry focused Technology Centres with over 300 member companies at present and the Technology Gateways programme which generates over 200 collaborative research projects completed for industry each year to provide interfaces between the academic research community and companies in Ireland.  </p><p>All of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s business development supports, including research and innovation funding, contribute to the overall export and employment figures of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies, the majority of which are SMEs.  The following table shows the total number of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies from 2009 to 2013.  This data is based on the Annual Employment Survey carried out by Forf&aacute;s in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  The survey results do not provide a breakdown by company size or type of support received. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>Permanent Full Time </td><td>133523</td><td>137241</td><td>141228</td><td>145460</td><td>149718</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>16011</td><td>19336</td><td>21464</td><td>23991</td><td>26032</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>149534</td><td>156577</td><td>162692</td><td>169451</td><td>175750</td></tr></table></p><p>This steady increase in employment growth demonstrates the positive impact of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s direct support for SMEs. The growth in employment also reflects increasing levels of exports from EI client companies which reached &euro;15.2 billion in 2011,   &euro;16.2 billion in 2012, and &euro;17.1 billion in 2013. Enterprise Ireland supported companies, directly and indirectly, are estimated to account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy or approximately 16% of the total number at work.</p><p>Information on all supports for research and development is available on the Enterprise Ireland website &ndash; .</p></reply>

Foreign-owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds.  FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of &lsquo;new&rsquo; sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.   Every 10 jobs in an IDA Ireland client company supports 7 jobs in the wider economy. </p><p>  I am glad to say that the numbers employed in companies supported by IDA Ireland has steadily increased in the five year period 2009 to 2013 inclusive.  Total employment in IDA Ireland client companies (including companies that were formerly clients of Shannon Development) has risen from 144,843 in 2009 to 166,184 in 2013.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the unemployment problem and its specific ambition is to have 100,000 more people in work by 2016.  The Government has set out an objective to create a positive environment to support business start-ups and growth, drive exports and facilitate job creation and retention by the enterprise sector.</p><p>  Under the 2014 Action Plan, IDA Ireland is tasked with the creation of 13,000 new gross jobs (yielding approximately 6,000 net new jobs) during the year.   Significantly, under the Plan additional resources are committed to IDA Ireland aimed at achieving an increased market presence and consequential delivery of additional 10,000 new jobs (6,000 direct and 4,000 indirect) over and above the year&rsquo;s target of 13,000, intensifying employment growth over a five year period. </p><p>  In addition the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices.  The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops. The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p><p>  Under the 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines, which will enter into force on 1 July 2014, areas accounting for 51.28% of Ireland&rsquo;s population will now be eligible for assistance.  This represents a substantial increase from the 25% originally proposed by the Commission, and an increase from the 50% under the 2007-2013 Map.  Another key issue for Ireland in the negotiations on the Regional Aid Guidelines with the Commission was the prospect of not being allowed to grant aid large enterprises. Ireland was part of a group of Member States that successfully negotiated a compromise with the Commission whereby it will be possible to provide investment aid to large enterprises for new economic activities and diversification of existing enterprises into new products or new process innovation.  Aid intensity rates were also maintained at their current levels.  </p><p>  While the global outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, I am satisfied that IDA Ireland will continue to deliver on its target of creating a further 13,000 jobs this year as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p></reply>

Horizon 2020 is a core part of Europe 2020,  the Innovation Union and the European Research Area and is responding to the economic crisis through investing in future jobs and growth, addressing people&rsquo;s concerns about their livelihoods, safety and environment and strengthening the EU&rsquo;s global position in research, innovation and technology.</p><p>  Ireland is well positioned to benefit from Horizon 2020, building on our excellent performance in the last EU programme for research and development, the Seventh EU Framework Programme (FP7), where some &euro;600m in funding was awarded to companies and academics in Ireland.  Irish-based foreign multinationals are actively supported by to engage in collaborative international research.  In FP7 there were over 400 participations by 70 IDA Ireland client companies, with over &euro;32m of funding awarded to such companies. </p><p>  In December 2013, the Government approved a national strategy for participation in Horizon 2020 together with an ambitious target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding to Ireland over the lifetime of Horizon 2020. The strategy sets out a comprehensive range of actions designed to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme and achieve the target, involving all of the key Departments, agencies and research performers. A Horizon 2020 High Level Group, under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established to oversee the implementation of the national strategy. This includes identifying key areas of opportunity where researchers, agencies and companies in Ireland can maximise their participation in the programme. </p><p>  A national support network of National Contact Points coordinated by Enterprise Ireland has been established, comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies, charged with helping companies and academics access the funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020. </p><p>  I am confident that, building on our successful performance in FP7 and supported by our national strategy and a strong national support network, Irish companies and multinational corporations based in Ireland will continue to have excellent support to compete for Horizon 2020 funding.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.136.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500050#WRC01300"><p>The importance of investment in science, technology and innovation to Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing and future economic and social development has been well recognised by the Government. Our focus has and continues to be very much on prioritising public investment in research while better exploiting results in order to lead to an acceleration of growth and job creation. This investment in scientific research  is having many positive impacts including powering an innovative and enterprising economy, creating high-value jobs, attracting, developing and nurturing business, scientists and talented people and ensuring Ireland is connected and respected internationally.</p><p>  In order for companies to grow their employment, they need to increase their competitiveness and grow their sales and export growth; to achieve success on the global market they must be innovative in order to differentiate themselves.  Investment is based on a dual approach. Firstly, investing in people, infrastructure and associated facilities to build the science base and secondly, direct support to the enterprise sector to build their capacity for research and development.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, together with the IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of science, technology and innovation development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. </p><p>  Employment by companies supported by Enterprise Ireland increased by a net 5,442 in 2013.  This represents the highest level of job growth in a decade and is a positive indication of a productive indigenous enterprise sector where investment in science, technology and innovation continues to play a key role.  Similarly, IDA Ireland saw a fourth consecutive year of employment growth with 7,071 net new jobs in 2013 and 164 new investments won, with 27 of these specifically in Research, Development and Innovation. Science Foundation Ireland is a key part of the enterprise ecosystem and in 2013 SFI had links to 41% (2618) of 6,449 jobs (90 company announcements) announced by the IDA in all fields.</p><p>  The commercialisation of research represents one of the most direct ways a return from the investment in science and innovation can be seen and this return is most recognisably evidenced by the number of commercially valuable technologies transferred from the higher education sector to industry and the number of spin out companies created that are based on academic research. Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the commercialisation of all research funded in the State and it employs two main approaches in this regard; by funding the commercialisation &amp;amp; technology transfer infrastructure in the State and by operating a commercialisation funding programme.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s research commercialisation activities helped to create thirty-four spin-out companies from higher education research and facilitated the transfer of over 100 pieces of commercially valuable technology to companies in 2013. Over 100 companies were created via its on-campus entrepreneurial training initiative, New Frontiers. These activities were supported by the extensive campus incubation facilities which housed 350 companies employing over 1500 people in 2013.</p><p>  The recent launch of Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) - the state funded central technology transfer office - further advances the Government&rsquo;s plan to strengthen and standardise the Irish knowledge transfer infrastructure. </p><p>  KTI is the first resource of its kind in Europe and offers businesses the ability to search research and expertise available in Irish HEIs, find opportunities to licence new technology and IP, and access practical guides and model agreements - all of which can be used by business as a starting point to engaging with the research sector.</p><p>  The 2014 European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published recently shows Ireland increasing its position from tenth to ninth in the overall ranking of 28 Member States. It is also particularly encouraging to see that Ireland is the overall leader in the indicator for the economic effects of innovation. This captures the economic success of innovation in employment in knowledge-intensive activities, the contribution of medium and high-tech product exports to the trade balance, exports of knowledge-intensive services, sales due to innovation activities and license and patent revenues from selling technologies abroad.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs gives a clear mandate to Enterprise Ireland to drive entrepreneurship and new business start-ups. 2013 was a very strong year with many highlights, including the big increase in female led start-ups and the strong showing of new start-ups from overseas and spin-outs from Irish Universities and Institutes of Technology. In 2013, Enterprise Ireland invested in 104 new High Potential Start Up companies and also provided critical funding to 85 early stage entrepreneurs under its Competitive Start Funds. These companies come from a wide range of sectors including key areas that the Government has targeted for growth, including the financial services, ICT, games, pharmaceutical and medical devices. </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 emphasises the importance of innovation and the use of technology as core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2014 and into the coming years. Research and development support programmes and initiatives remain key to the setting up of new and supporting existing Irish business in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and employment.  My Department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research, development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science, Technology and Innovation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-05a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014060500050#WRC01800"><p>The Development Agencies and the new Local Enterprise Offices operate a range of supports and services, including assisting companies in both the Manufacturing and Services sectors, as both of these sectors are crucial to the economy and to job creation. In addition, it can be possible for companies to also access State or EU supports from other sources. However many companies are not exclusively in either the manufacturing or services sectors and not all such companies are eligible for assistance,  depending on complex rules. For these reasons, there is considerable difficulty in providing clearly defined data as sought by the Deputy and the information requested is not easily available in the format requested.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned and which was published last year, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016. To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the Strategy. Some of this assistance will take the form of mentoring and management development, rather than financial support. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers  identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly, only some of which would be State supported. </p><p>  Foreign-owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds and IDA Ireland has been very successful in attracting these foreign companies, many of which have manufacturing or service-related activity, or even both, but not all of whom would qualify for financial support.   It has been established that every 10 jobs created in multinational companies lead to approximately 7 jobs being created elsewhere in the economy in supply and service businesses, so the employment generation is very significant. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works in partnership with Irish enterprises to help them start, grow, innovate and win export sales on global markets. That Agency works with about 3,500 client companies and those clients include many in Manufacturing and Internationally Traded Services sectors, but also others in the innovation space, which are not as easy to exclusively categorise.</p><p>  The Services sector accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland. While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the job creation trend is very positive.  A range of sectoral initiatives have been devised to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services. </p><p>  Both the manufacturing and services sectors are therefore important sectors for job growth potential and there will be a continued focus on their development, but inevitably only some of this support will be financial.</p></reply>

It is not only important to support existing entrepreneurs but also to work towards encouraging greater levels of entrepreneurship in the future. Using additional funding secured, my Department is continuing its work on developing a range of new initiatives in 2014 to support youth entrepreneurship and young people with a business idea to start their own business, to be delivered through the Local Enterprise offices (LEOs) and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May I launched a new competition to find Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur, with a total fund of &euro;2million available to invest in winning businesses and entrepreneurs in every county in the country. The competition is open to individuals aged 30 and under and will be judged under three distinct categories:</p><p>- best new idea</p><p>- best start-up business</p><p>- best established business with new add-on.</p><p>Mentoring, marketing and other supports will also be available to participating businesses at various stages of the competition from the LEOs.</p><p>On 29<sup>th</sup>May I launched a new &euro;500,000 Enterprise Ireland Competitive Start Fund targeted at stimulating new start-up business activity for graduates. This fund will provide for up to &euro;50,000 in support for each successful applicant.  This Fund is the first of its type for graduates and will provide a package of financial and developmental supports. Applications will be considered on a competitive basis and the financial support will be in the form of equity investment. The support will be towards costs associated with developing the business and achieving key milestones.</p><p>Within the context of the Action Plan for Jobs, I have also committed to:</p><p>- roll out an enhanced Student Enterprise Awards initiative targeting a greater number of students from the third level sector and increasing the quality of applications.</p><p>- Support the voluntary youth work sector by facilitating links between local youth services and the LEOs and Microfinance Ireland so that young people, especially those who are furthest from the labour market, can be supported and mentored in entrepreneurial initiatives.</p><p>The LEOs will be shortly completing their comprehensive Enterprise Development Plans for each Local Authority area for review by the Enterprise Ireland Centre of Excellence. A specific element of these plans is the LEOs&rsquo; efforts to promote entrepreneurship in schools. As with all elements of the LEOs&rsquo; activities, the intention of the Centre of Excellence will be to identify best practice across the LEOs and promote this for adoption across the country. In this specific area, this should over time lead to increased participation and impact as approaches are developed and fine-tuned.</p></reply>

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.   </p><p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect an individual public servant will reflect his or her particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.     Public servants who must retire at age 65 can draw their public service pension at age 65.  The State pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category.  </p><p>  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension.  The State pension (contributory) entitlement is calculated with reference to the complete PRSI record, including contributions made while working in the public and private sectors, and it would not be possible for my Department to state how many, if any, such retirees have been impacted by changes to the State pension (contributory).</p><p>  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years. This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.</p><p>  It is therefore necessary to claim the available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by almost 90 private transport operators. There are currently over 780,000 people in receipt of free travel. </p><p>  Funding for the free travel scheme was capped by the previous Government as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014. During this period it has not been possible to accept additional routes or providers within the scheme.    </p><p>  Given the increasing number of recipients and the funding pressures, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I established a working group with representatives from the two Departments, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority to review the free travel scheme. The purpose of this review is to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the free travel scheme. The work of this group is expected to conclude shortly.   </p><p>  I will examine the report of the working group as soon as it is available.

This correspondence supplied by the Deputy will be included as part of that process. </p><p>  In order for the draft national plan to be finalised, site specific management plans must be prepared, which will determine, for example, whether or not there is a case to be made under Article 6.3 or 6.4 of the Habitats Directive for continued cutting on the site in question and what approach will be taken to site restoration.</p><p>  The proposals made in the correspondence referred to in the Deputy's Question will be discussed with the local community as the relevant site specific management plan is being prepared.

It is understood that at least two professional bodies, the Chartered Institute of Technologists (CIAT) and the Royal Institution of Architects of Ireland (RIAI), include architectural technologists in their membership. </p><p>In recent weeks both the CIAT and the RIAI have independently signalled to my Department their intention to establish separate voluntary registers of architectural technologists with a view to having these registers recognised in law in due course. While not directly involved in the development of the proposals to date, my Department is now to give immediate detailed consideration to the matter of the prospective registers and will engage with both professional bodies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to the matter shortly. </p><p>It should of course be noted that inclusion on the existing statutory registers is not confined to members of the registration bodies concerned. A variety of routes to registration exist and Ireland is unique in this regard in providing open routes for those who can demonstrate that they have acquired the requisite experience and competence in the design and surveying of buildings to become registered. A significant number of Architectural Technologists have succeeded to date in becoming registered.</p><p>I would therefore encourage those Architectural Technologists who consider they possess the requisite competence in the design of construction works to contact EI, RIAI and <b>SCSI</b>in order to pursue registration so that they can avail of the many opportunities in relation to the new roles of Design Certifier and/or Assigned Certifier that are now available to registered construction professionals as a consequence of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p></reply>

I am concerned to ensure that in such cases the introduction of the new regulations is not exploited entirely inappropriately to quote for excessive services. While the new regulations will support improved competence and professionalism, which will provide additional work opportunities for competent practitioners and construction professionals, homeowners should not have to pay an inflated rate for excessive inspection services. In this regard, I have asked my Department as a matter of urgency in conjunction with the Housing Agency and the construction professional bodies, to prepare guidance on an appropriate inspection plan for a single, stand-alone dwelling. This will inform the market in relation to offering realistic and appropriately priced professional services for such work. I understand that the construction professional bodies are already well advanced in terms of providing similar guidance on this and other matters relevant to the new arrangements for building control. I have asked my Department to keep the issue under close and continuing review.</p></reply>

The Scheme is comprised of Officials from the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Military management and the Representative Associations.</p><p>  The unsatisfactory age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990&rsquo;s and was the subject of severe criticism by a series of external reports, mainly Price Waterhouse Consultants and the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG). One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p></reply>

That said there were a small number of individuals who reported access difficulties. In all instances these difficulties transpired to be browser-related. In this regard callers to the dedicated Agfood.ie helpdesk, who reported such problems were advised to switch to the recommended browser.</p><p>  It is important to highlight the fact that aside from the dedicated help line, online users also have access to the online user guide, which is a step by step guide to each stage of the process, including screenshots to assist the user.</p><p>  The online system continues to be a great success, with a record 80,000 applications submitted under the 2014 Scheme. This represents an eleven-fold increase since the system was launched in 2007, each year bringing record numbers of online applications. Initially, farmers and their approved agents were attracted to iNet by the fact that it guaranteed immediate, verifiable receipt by my Department of their applications and, through the system of in-built validations, significantly reduced the numbers of errors that could be made, thereby ultimately leading to speedier payment. The introduction in 2012 of an on-line mapping element allowed farmers, or their agents, who needed to submit maps to the Department, to do so through iNet, thereby dispensing with the need to submit paper maps. While over 13,000 maps submitted online last year, this number increased to over 15,500 this year. </p><p>  My Department remains committed to the continued ongoing development of iNet, to the mutual benefit of farmers and the efficient operation of payment systems.</p></reply>

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.</p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure. This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. In general, the process involves audit missions to the Member State by Commission officials; follow-up correspondence between the two parties on the findings of the mission and the observations and remedial actions undertaken by the Member States. There is also a formal bi-lateral meeting between the two parties followed by further correspondence. At the end of this phase, the Commission issues its letter of findings; as indicated, this letter issued very recently. The Member State has the right to ask for the matter to be reviewed by the Conciliation Body. This body will review the case and seek written and oral observations from each party. It will make its recommendations and the Commission will consider these before arriving at its final definitive decision. </p><p>  In the case of Ireland, the Clearance procedure is currently covering five financial years involving the 2008 to 2012 scheme-years. I can confirm that my Department has been informed of a potential flat rate financial correction that the EU Commission may impose on Ireland in respect of the period 2008 to 2012 covering EU direct aid for the period of some &euro;9 billion.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case and the position of Irish farmers is strenuously argued during the process. I can also reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of all Irish farmers during the process including the interest of that majority of farmers, who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes. During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this total amounted to &euro;25.6 million (or 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States). Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10% or greater depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved &ndash; a 2% correction on the 2008 &ndash; 2012 scheme years would mean, according to the Commission&rsquo;s figures, a loss of &euro;182m in funding to Ireland. On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission are satisfied with the calculations. In such circumstances,  if the risk is dealt with by the Member State by collecting the debts arising from the over-payments, the amounts collected is taken into account by the Commission in its final assessment. This is the approach Ireland is following.</p><p>  I am strongly of the view that a flat rate correction is not justified considering the work already carried out by my Department in order to accurately assess the calculated risk involved and the actions taken to eliminate that risk. A detailed case is being prepared for the EU Conciliation Body (which mediates on these corrections), which will argue strongly from both a legal and technical viewpoint that a flat rate correction is not justified for Ireland.</p><p>  No final decision is expected until late in the year and in the meantime every effort will be made to keep any correction to an absolute minimum, recognising the vast amount of work which has been carried out to date by my Department to address land eligibility.</p></reply>

Following the work of the Review Group on Transport Supports for People with Disabilities and the Inter-Departmental Group tasked by Government to consider details of a statutory replacement for the discontinued schemes,  the Government decided in November 2013, that the preparatory work required for a new travel subsidy scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health. Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.</p><p>  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of people in receipt of both payments is not available in the format requested.  However, the Health Service Executive continues to make payment to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance payment in February 2013.</p><p>  The Motorised Transport Grant was a single payment payable once in any three year period and was made to approximately 300 people each year. As the Motorised Transport Grant scheme was closed in February 2013, no payments have been made since then. </p><p>  Given that decisions around eligibility criteria and means testing have yet to be made in relation to any new scheme, it is not possible to provide an estimation of the number of people possibly waiting to apply for any new scheme.</p></reply>

The White Paper also sets out policy proposals for the treatment of different service areas, which incorporates the services of allied healthcare professionals.  UHI will focus on services delivered at the individual patient or client level, and allied healthcare professionals will have an important role in this approach.  </p><p>  The Government will shortly establish an Expert Commission to consider in detail the range of services to be included either within the UHI standard package of services or within the overall health basket.  The inclusion of services delivered by allied healthcare professionals will be considered as part of that process.  The Commission will consult widely and will present a series of options to Government.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children will also review the options presented by the Commission.  The final decision on the services to be included in the UHI standard package and the overall health basket will be made by the Government.  I am cognisant of the need for service integration at an operational level between services funded by the standard UHI package and those funded separately to UHI, both for individuals availing of the services and for those who provide the service.  </p><p>  I am keen to hear the views of allied healthcare professionals given the important role they play in the delivery of primary and community care.  I would like to thank those who made a submission during the first consultation process, which focused on the White Paper and ran from 2 April until 28 May.  I would encourage their full participation in the remaining consultation processes.</p></reply>

However the issue of licences based on exchange for a third country licence has delayed matters.  My Department is aware of this, and has been in communication with the embassy in Ottawa in order to explore ways of overcoming this. Negotiations are also at an advanced stage with Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador.  While it is hoped to make progress in due course with British Columbia, it will not be among the first agreements reached.</p><p>  Reaching such an agreement is not only a matter of facilitating the exchange of licences by Irish residents in Canada or by Canadian residents in Ireland. Rather it also involves both sides ensuring that the people licensed to drive in the other jurisdiction are properly qualified.  As a result, when Ireland makes agreements of this kind with other jurisdictions, we require, as a standard component of the agreement, that we will not accept for exchange licences issued by the other jurisdiction if those licences were in turn derived from an exchange with a third country with which we do not have an exchange relationship.</p><p>  I am keen to see exchange agreements reached with the Canadian provinces as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This is delivered in partnership with the young person, his or her family, foster carers, social workers, key residential social care workers and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies. Approximately 450 children leave care annually.</p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living. The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships; secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training. </p><p>  The core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged. Many young people remain in their foster care placement after 18 &ndash; the assistance they need may be a continuation of the fostering arrangements and support in accessing educational opportunities. Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.</p><p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st  April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. I understand that following this meeting a report is being prepared, which will be forwarded to me in due course. I will consider its content prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p><p>  There is no funding directly available from my Department to not for profit organisations providing services for care leavers. Aftercare is delivered directly by the Child and Family Agency with additional support provided through Service Level Agreements between the Agency and Focus Ireland, Cross Care, Don Bosco and the Simon Community. The Agency has advised that there is no new funding currently available to develop such additional services. However, any organisation interested in providing aftercare services is invited to forward their proposal to the relevant Regional Service Director of the Agency. These will be considered by the Agency in the context of its ongoing review of funding to all service providers. </p></reply>
