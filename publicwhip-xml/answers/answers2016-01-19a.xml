Thereafter the conditions of contract and the legislation governing the referenced areas ensure compliance, with oversight undertaken by the contracting authority concerned and the appropriate statutory bodies as necessary.</p>  <p>  Contracting authorities set down the minimum standards for those applying for public contracts in the pre-qualification stage of a tender competition.  Compliance with tax and social welfare requirements is dealt with under the criterion covering the personal situation of the applicant.  Specifically in relation to works, the duties imposed on clients by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 are dealt with as part of the pre-qualification and award stage of the procurement process.  Competency is dealt with in the pre-qualification stage by assessing the applicant's qualfications and experience whereas the question of adequate resources falls under both the pre-qualification and award stages of a procurement process.</p>  <p>  Self-declarations may be permitted at the early stage of the pre-qualification process to reduce the administrative burden on both businesses and public bodies. However, successful tenderers or successful candidates in the case of a restricted procedure are required to provide the pre-determined evidence in support of those declarations, a failure to provide the required evidence will result in a rejection of their tender on the basis of non-compliance.</p>  <p>  Tax compliance is further enforced through the requirement for a current tax clearance certificate to be produced prior to the award of the contract and for any payments thereunder.  </p>  <p>  The Public Works Contract also makes provision for deductions from payments in accordance with the legislation governing taxation in that sector.  Health and Safety legislation is underlined and enforced throughout the Public Works Contract by enshrining legal requirements as conditions of contract so that serious health and safety breaches may be relied upon as breach of contract leading to termination.</p>  <p>  These are in addition to the remedies contained in law which are enforced by the appropriate statutory bodies who possess the necessary powers to investigate and to bring proceedings.</p></reply>

No sanctions have been issued for new appointments in excess of these pay ceilings. </p><p>When considering how to best implement a reduction in pay to CEOs in a fair and balanced manner, I decided that instead of just applying a &euro;250,000 cap, which is a crude instrument that only affects pay rates above that figure, I would reduce the salary ranges that apply to CEO salaries which has the effect of both reducing the salary for all CEOs in an proportionate manner while maintaining the &quot;weightings&quot; between each Company.</p><p>The appointment of Special Advisers requires the approval of Government in accordance with section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. Special Advisers have been employed by Ministers of successive Governments and perform an essential function in providing expert advice, expertise and insights on the key strategic issues facing Ministers. </p><p>The current Guidelines provide that Special Advisers are to be placed on the Principal Officer (standard) scale, which currently runs from &euro;75,647 at the minimum to &euro;87,258 at the maximum. They provide that appointments are to be on the first point on the scale except where I approve a higher starting salary. Therefore, in cases where a Special Adviser's basic pay prior to the appointment was greater than the minimum of the Principal Officer (standard scale), it is open to Ministers to seek sanction from me to appoint the person to a higher starting salary.  </p><p>I would like to point out that that separate arrangements may apply to the staffing requirements of the Offices of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.</p></reply>

Any funding that would be raised through the issuing by Government of a new Development Bond, as suggested in the question, would be on-balance sheet in General Government terms.  As a result, any such funding would have no impact on the fiscal space available to the Government and would not provide any additional capacity for further Exchequer expenditure without equivalent spending cuts in other areas or tax increases, in order to continue to comply with the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recognise that maintaining fiscal sustainability and economic stability under the Government's fiscal framework will ensure that Ireland retains the hard-won restored confidence of international financial markets to meet its ongoing funding needs.  This is central to the continuance of Ireland's economic recovery, securing further reductions in unemployment, achieving further gains in living standards and ensuring the continued development of our public services.</p></reply>

The flood protection capital programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 will build on the very significant investment that has already been undertaken in flood relief works throughout the country over the last 20 years.</p>  <p>  This funding will allow the Office of Public Works (OPW) to continue with the implementation of its current comprehensive programme of flood relief Capital Works which includes projects at various stages of design, planning and construction. Within the &euro;430 million funding envelope, the OPW's allocation for capital flood relief works in 2016 is &euro;52.561m. Separate to this capital allocation another &euro;15.3m in non-capital funding has been allocated to the OPW in 2016 for its ongoing arterial drainage maintenance works programme.  There are currently five major flood defence schemes at construction with a further 26 at design and planning. </p>  <p>  The funding will also enable the OPW continue its Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme which allows local authorities to submit applications for funding to OPW for localised projects costing under &euro;0.5m and which meet required criteria including minimum cost benefit standards. Over 500 projects have been approved by OPW since the scheme came into operation in 2009 with funding of approximately &euro;29m being provided.</p>  <p>  The OPW's flood relief funding allocation will also allow it to continue with its essential hydrometric data gathering and analysis work and other important research and studies in hydrology, coastal and other flood related matters.</p>  <p>  The significant funding made available by the Government in its Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 will also allow the OPW continue to plan for the future flood risk management needs of the country through its comprehensive Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.

Also taken into consideration in these ceilings is the  roll-out of the Rural Development Programme, a forecast reduction in the number of people on the Live Register, the carry-over impact of  certain Budget 2016 measures including costs relating to the Lansdowne Road Agreement and the revised capital envelope set out in the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  Actual expenditure beyond 2016 will ultimately be a matter for Government decision-making, in light of the fiscal space determined in line with the Stability and Growth Pact obligations at the time and its allocation between tax and expenditure measures as determined by Government.</p></reply>

The &euro;430 million allocation will enable the OPW to continue with the implementation of its existing programme of flood relief capital works and to commence implementation on a prioritised basis from 2017 onwards of the structural flood defence measures that will be included in the flood risk management plans being prepared under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme including any viable measures identified to address flooding in the coastal locations included in the Programme. These plans are due to be finalised by the end of 2016.</p><p>The CFRAM Programme is the core strategy for addressing flood risk in areas at potentially significant risk from flooding.  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  </p><p>Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is now underway in the CFRAM Programme.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified. The Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner. Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p><p>Pending the completion of the CFRAM Plans, the OPW is continuing with the implementation of its existing comprehensive programme of flood relief Capital Works which includes projects at various stages of design, planning and construction.

The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with the Local Authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  </p>  <p>  Public consultation, which provides opportunities for interested persons to convey local flooding knowledge and the preferred solution, is a key element of the CFRAM Programme.  To date this has involved:</p>  <p>-  a public consultation to inform the designation of the 300 areas, that include 90 coastal areas; and</p>  <p>-  meeting in person with each of these 300 communities to explain the assessed and predictive flood risks and their impact for their areas and importantly to get their local knowledge and insight.

Members of the public may also contact the individual CFRAM Study engineering consultants by phone, post or email.  Further details are available via www.cfram.ie.</p>  <p>  When the OPW commences a major flood relief scheme there are opportunities, through local public information days, for the public to make observations on any emerging proposals.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate in favour of a particular candidate on grounds such as existing relationship with the contracting authority that is carrying out a tender process and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may select suppliers to submit tenders in a public procurement procedure are set out in Regulation 58 of SI 329 of 2006 European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations and Article 48 and Recitals (39) of 2004/18/EC which is the EU Directive on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public contracts.  In short a contracting authority should set out, non-discriminatory criteria for use when selecting competitors. Samples may be requested as part of this process. It is up to the potential supplier to prove that they have satisfied those criteria.</p>  <p>  In order to assist contracting authorities the Office of Government Procurement has developed standard template documents for procurement processes and the award of contracts. These have been designed to enable contracting authorities carry out procurement processes in a consistent manner. These templates set out the procedures for requesting samples and also the documentation that should accompany them. It is up to the supplier to meet the standards requested. It would be reasonable for a contracting authority to seek the standards that meet their needs and these can of course change over the years.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of appeal, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on a specific tender. Establishing the levels of qualification criteria and award criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is the responsibility of the contracting authority concerned.  This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge what is appropriate relative to the needs of that specific contract. In this regard, I would therefore suggest that the supplier seek feedback from the contracting authority.</p></reply>

These measures, together with the Public Service Pension Reduction implemented in January 2011, are estimated to have resulted in over &euro;2.2bn in direct reductions in public service remuneration and pensions. </p>  <p>  It is not possible, within the fiscal space currently available to Government and the requirement to manage public expenditure in accordance with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, to reverse &euro;2.2bn in FEMPI measures in one year. To do so would contravene EU Fiscal rules and reverse the hard won progress made in rescuing the economy from the financial collapse which it so recently faced. </p>  <p>  The Government has now, through the negotiation and agreement of a financially prudent public service agreement on pay and related issues, provided for a gradual unwinding of the FEMPI measures as they apply to public servants. The terms of this agreement, the Lansdowne Road Agreement, are being implemented under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 with effect from 1 January 2016 at a full year cost of &euro;844m to 2018. Provision has also been made for an amelioration of the PSPR for public service pensioners at an additional full year cost of &euro;90m in 2018. This approach has also enabled additional resources to be assigned for the ongoing recruitment of additional front line public service staff such as Garda&iacute;, Teachers and Health professionals to support the delivery of our vital public services.  </p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In that context, economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures.</p></reply>

A decision on the classification of Irish Water was published by Eurostat in July 2015 based on their appraisal of the Irish Water business plan, as presented to them, in the context of these rules.  The classification of Irish Water for future years will be dealt with as part of the review of the register of public sector and general government bodies undertaken annually by CSO.  Under the normal rules for the classification of publicly controlled bodies, any reconsideration of the market/non-market nature of these bodies is based on observed data over a number of years (generally 3 years).  </p>  <p>  One factor in the Eurostat decision on Irish Water was their view of the uncertainty of the business case projections.  Therefore it may be possible to begin a review of the classification decision as actual results become available, and CSO will be following up on this with Eurostat in 2016. In line with the normal rules for sector classification it would be possible to consider classifying Irish Water as a market entity only when sales are observed to exceed 50% of costs on a consistent basis.</p></reply>

While the QNHS provides quarterly benchmark estimates of unemployment, the CSO also publishes monthly unemployment estimates.

The Programme for Government outlined an ambitious agenda for D&aacute;il Reform to be introduced in a phased process over the lifetime of the Government.  On foot of this, since 2011 the Government has brought forward several packages of measures to reform the operation of the D&aacute;il so as to improve its working and enhance the legislative role of members.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently indicated its acceptance of a number of recommendations for Constitutional change and for changes in Standing Orders as made by the Convention on the Constitution in its Seventh Report, on D&aacute;il Reform. </p><p>The reforms the Government have already introduced in the D&aacute;il since 2011 include the following.</p><p><b>Increased Number of Sitting Days</b></p><p>The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas, Easter, public holidays and the summer and introducing regular Friday sitting days. </p><p>In the 45 months for which the previous Government was in office, the D&aacute;il sat for 349 days &ndash; an average of 93 days a year.  In the present Government's period in office, the 57 months to end 2015, the D&aacute;il has sat for 588 days &ndash; an average of over 123 days a year. </p><p><b>D&aacute;il and Oireachtas Reform Package 2011</b></p><p>The first phase of D&aacute;il Reform, introduced in the summer of 2011, included:</p><p>1.  An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste</p><p>2.  Replacement of the outdated Adjournment Debates with Topical Issues Debates, to give Deputies an opportunity to raise issues directly with Ministers from the relevant Department</p><p>3.  Friday sittings, to enable Deputies to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il</p><p>4.  A mechanism for appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is dissatisfied with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question</p><p>5.  A Pre-Legislative review system, whereby Ministers could provide the Heads of a Bill to the relevant Oireachtas Committee to review before the Bill was published</p><p>6.  Reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16</p><p>7.  Introducing a new Oireachtas Committee chaired by an Opposition Deputy to work with Ombudsmen's offices and review petitions. </p><p><b>Oireachtas Committee Reforms 2012</b></p><p>In the summer of 2012 the Oireachtas Committee system was streamlined to provide an additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.</p><p><b>D&aacute;il and Oireachtas Reform Package 2013</b></p><p>In September 2013 the Government announced a further phase of D&aacute;il Reform:</p><p>1.  Opening up the law-making process through a Pre-Legislative Stage. A Pre-Legislative Stage at an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation.A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.  The Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in the process of law-making. The relevant Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.  Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill.</p><p>2.  Each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities.</p><p>3.  The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has been expanded.</p><p>4.  The number of Legislative Programmes has been reduced to two per year.</p><p>5.  The time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il has been increased, by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</p><p>6.  The proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill has five minutes at First Stage to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il.</p><p>7.  The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system.</p><p>-  The number of Bills introduced by Deputies has grown from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.</p><p>-  The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>-  The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply, or the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister from that Department is available.</p><p>-  Ministerial Questions have been reformed:</p><p>-  The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes.</p><p>-  An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached.</p><p>-  Each Deputy has 30 seconds to outline the question. </p><p>In addition to these reforms, and as mentioned earlier, the Government has indicated its acceptance of a number of recommendations for Constitutional change and changes in Standing Orders made by the Convention on the Constitution in its Seventh Report, on D&aacute;il Reform.</p><p>The Government Chief Whip outlined the Government's position on these in the D&aacute;il on Thursday 14 January, as follows. </p><p>The Government accepts that there is a case for a referendum to enhance the Office of Ceann Comhairle by giving it constitutional standing, and also for including a reference to Oireachtas Committees in the Constitution.</p><p>The Government also accepts three of the Convention's recommendations for changes to D&aacute;il Standing Orders and will shortly ask the D&aacute;il to amend Standing Orders accordingly. The three changes are:</p><p>-  election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot, intended to enhance the independence of the office of Ceann Comhairle and strengthen the link between the holder of that Office and the members of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>-  introduction of a system whereby the Taoiseach will appear before the Working Group of Committee Chairs twice a year.</p><p>-  proportionate allocation of Committee chairs using the d&rsquo;Hondt system.  </p><p>In addition, a number of Convention recommendations will be referred to the D&aacute;il Reform Sub-Committee for further consideration, including that the members of  Committees should have access to the support of a panel of external members and former TDs; and how the introduction of family friendly hours for the D&aacute;il, and a Committee Week, would work in practice. </p><p>As regards the measures proposed by the Deputy, both the Government Chief Whip and the D&aacute;il Reform Sub-Committee of D&aacute;il CPP are willing to consider any proposals made to them by any member of the House. The Deputy's proposals - the expansion of Leader's Questions to allow backbench Deputies an opportunity to raise issues of interest; an increase in the number of Topical Issues to six per day; and expansion of Minister's Questions to two hours to facilitate more Deputies' questions - have merit and could be considered for any future package of D&aacute;il reforms. </p></reply>

The Budget increased the maximum rates for all social welfare recipients aged 66 and over by &euro;3 per week.  This increase applied to State Pensions, but also to Widow aged 66 and over, Carer's Allowance recipients aged 66 and over and Incapacity Supplement recipients aged 66 and over.  In this context, the rate of payment for widows of working age was not changed.  </p>  <p>  A widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received the Household Benefits package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment. </p>  <p>  Where the surviving spouse/surviving civil partner was the person in receipt of the allowance(s) they can retain the Household Benefits package provided that the conditions for receipt of the allowance remains satisfied.  Where a widow/widower/surviving civil partner is also in receipt of half rate Disability Benefit this will not prevent him/her from qualifying for the Household Benefits Package.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce in Budget 2016 that the rate of the Fuel Allowance scheme was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50, which will be of benefit to many disadvantaged widows of all ages, and householders on long-term welfare, and will assist with meeting the costs of their heating needs during the winter season.  To receive Fuel Allowance, Widows pension recipients must also satisfy the other conditions for that payment, i.e., be unable to provide for their heating needs from the resources of their household, live alone or only with one of a list of exempted persons, and satisfy a means test.  All recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means-test. </p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;369 million.</p>  <p>  Initially when a person makes an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, 3 waiting days apply and payment is from the 4th day of the claim where there is no accrued holiday entitlement. In the administration of the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme the concept of continuity in a claim and the notion of &ldquo;linked claims&rdquo; is a key component of how the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme operates in practice. Where a person makes a repeat jobseeker&rsquo;s claim within 26 weeks from the end of a previous claim, both claims may be linked and no waiting days apply. This applies to all jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claimants, including seasonal workers. Where a person makes a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit more than 26 weeks from their previous jobseeker&rsquo;s claim 3 waiting days are served and payment commences on the fourth day.</p>  <p>  To better facilitate Department of Social Protection customers, I have introduced a system where all new or repeat customers can make an appointment, at a time that suits them, with their local Intreo office to discuss or submit their application form.   </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s modernisation programme and the public service reform plan, the Department has moved into the delivery of online services.  This means that, for the first time, customers will be able to make an application for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment online from 29 January 2016, using the MyWelfare.ie portal.  MyWelfare.ie is designed to enable clients to access personalised Department of Social Protection services by registering for, and creating a personal account. The portal has been operational since July 2015 and currently allows customers to book PPSN and Public Service Card appointments.</p>  <p>  For jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, the on-line application form on MyWelfare.ie has been developed in a way to ensure that the staff who will be processing claims will receive all of the information that they require in a usable format so as to be able to make an informed decision in a timely manner without further recourse to the customer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that if a person signs off from jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to take up work for up to 12 weeks, there is a fast track system in place to ensure they are able to make this transition in an easy and efficient manner.  This fast track system allows the individual to quickly sign back on their jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme and then continue to receive benefits after the work or course finishes.</p></reply>

Two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have been contracted by the Department to deliver JobPath services. At the end of 2015 some 3,000 jobseekers had been referred to Seetec.  It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken. JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies. JobPath is so structured that the companies will not be able to fully recover their costs until they place sufficient numbers of jobseekers into sustainable jobs.  The companies have a year to work with each jobseeker in order to secure employment.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to find jobs.

However, the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. In my role as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems, with a view to addressing the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim, there is a focus on prioritising spending on flood relief measures, development and implementation of plans by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement flood relief schemes. This strategy is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which provides for the transfer by the OPW of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes to the insurance industry, which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  </p>  <p>  The OPW has advised me that Durrus in Co. Cork is an Area of Further Assessment (AFA) under the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management project, and has therefore been the subject of detailed assessment and modelling, leading to the production of draft flood maps. These draft maps were the subject of local Public Consultation Days throughout the country and a statutory public consultation process which concluded on 23rd December 2015. It has clearly been stated that the draft flood maps were published for consultation purposes only and use of the maps for any other purposes is not permitted.  Specifically, Insurance Ireland has been informed that these maps cannot be relied upon to inform insurance premiums, policies or excesses. All comments/responses received during the public consultation process will be considered before the flood maps are finalised.  The OPW has further advised me that for Sruth Mhuileann, the draft maps indicate that part of this development is an area of low flood probability, i.e. a 0.1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or a 1,000 year return period, while the remainder of the development is not a flood risk. The preferred design standard that flood risk options are to address is typically the 1% AEP or 100 year return period, and flood risk management options are not designed to manage more extreme flood risks than this.</p>  <p>  The current flooding crisis has raised issues in relation to insurance and flooding. The Taoiseach and some other of my colleagues in Government met the insurance industry on Tuesday 12th January 2016 to discuss the industry's role in providing flood insurance and to obtain the industry's views on flood insurance issues such as those outlined in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy. The Taoiseach has asked the insurance industry to revert back within two weeks following further consideration of their approach to the provision of insurance in areas where demountable defences are in place, along with details on the availability of insurance in areas with flood defences.</p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are undertaking detailed research on alternative options with the potential to ensure greater availability of flood insurance. This will be in the form of a comparative analysis of the different approaches to flood insurance in other countries.</p></reply>

Rather NAMA has acquired loans and its role is that of a lender with claims over security for its loans, like a bank, rather than a property owner or lessor.  The sale of properties securing NAMA's loans is managed directly by the property owners or, where the property is the subject of enforcement, by the appointed receiver/administrator.</p><p>NAMA debtors and receivers, who do control residential property, offer such property for open market sale and, in the majority of cases, potential homebuyers may bid for individual residential units. These are advertised in the normal way in newspapers and estate agent websites throughout the country. A selling agent, who advertises a property on behalf of a debtor, would not generally refer to specific properties as being affiliated to the secured lender. This is no different in the sale of property securing NAMA's loans than it would be for the sale of properties securing a bank's loans.</p><p>The NAMA website () includes a list of residential properties to which receivers have been appointed and which are either for sale or are likely to be offered for sale through receivers in the near future.  The NAMA website does not include properties being sold by NAMA debtors or their agents, as to do so would identify such debtors as NAMA debtors.  NAMA is legally precluded from identifying its debtors under the NAMA Act 2009.  As explained, these properties are openly marketed by the debtor or appointed receiver, rather than NAMA, and are open to bids from individual buyers in the majority of cases.</p><p>In certain cases, NAMA debtors and receivers have offered residential units for sale as part of multi-unit sales transactions where this was the most efficient means of managing and completing transactions. However, in such cases, the units concerned are usually occupied by tenants under letting agreements and the option of sale by individual unit may not necessarily be available.  A tenant's statutory rights are unaffected by any such sale.  As the Deputy will be aware, the decision on sales strategy is made based on the maximisation of value in all instances.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that all consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions are now covered by  the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015. Therefore borrowers are now restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman also have this right restored by this legislation.</p><p>The Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) were introduced by the Central Bank in March 2013, as a prudential policy measure, to set progressively more demanding quantitative targets for specified Credit Institutions to process mortgage arrears cases and achieve sustainable outcomes.  Retail credit firms, which are not authorised to accept deposits, are not subject to the prudential standards set out in the MART.  However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit firms as to other regulated lenders, including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  Any decision about extending the application of MART targets would be a matter for the Central Bank, but as the Deputy is already aware, the Central Bank  announced last April that following a thorough assessment of it's supervisory approach to mortgage arrears, it has determined that relying on common quarterly solution targets across all banks is no longer appropriate.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including Retail Credit Firms, dealing with borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan which is secured by their  primary residence.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  The Central Bank monitors Retail Credit Firms' treatment of borrowers under the CCMA and engages with them in relation to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), as provided for in the CCMA.</p><p>You will be aware that on 23 June 2015 the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of lenders' compliance with its statutory CCMA, which found that, overall, lenders have implemented frameworks as required by the CCMA.  These results are available at .  I am informed by the Central Bank that Retail Credit firms were included in the scope of this themed inspection of the CCMA.  The Central Bank has confirmed that it is currently reviewing responses received from all lenders that were subject to the CCMA themed inspection. It continues to engage with these lenders as part of it's on-going supervisory engagement to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).</p></reply>

Data is provided by all entities that hold loans secured on properties located in the Republic of Ireland including inter alia bank and non-bank entities.  The most recent series (Q3 2015 data) was published by the Central Bank on 11 December 2015 and can be accessed at . A total stock of 120,806 PDH mortgage accounts were categorised as restructured at end Q3 2015, reflecting an increase of 1.9% when compared with the previous quarter. Split mortgages and arrears capitalisations accounted for 20% and 28% of the total PDH restructures respectively, and showed significant increases over the quarter.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have no direct function in the relationship between the customer and banks. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a shareholder in certain financial institutions, I must ensure that these banks are run on a commercial and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State.</p><p>Decisions taken by the banks are a matter for the board and management of the relevant institution. The relationship framework agreements define the arm's-length nature of the relationship between the State and the banks in which the State has an investment. All banks operating in the State are therefore entitled to pursue all options open to them within the significant constraints imposed by the regulator, the Central Bank and the law as it applies.  In this context, I would remind the Deputy of the strong consumer protection framework provided by the CCMA, in particular provision 39 - Resolution, which requires each lender to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) which it offers, when determining which ARA options are viable for each particular case.</p></reply>

The extent of the illicit trade in cigarettes is estimated, however, through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Service Executive by Ipsos MRBI. Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes, the results of the 2014 survey indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT attributable to the illegal trade was of the order of &euro;214 million.</p>  <p>  I am advised also that combatting the illegal tobacco and fuel trades is, and will continue to be, a high priority for Revenue.</p>  <p>  Revenue's actions against the illegal tobacco trade include a range of measures to identify and target those who are involved in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing those products and prosecuting the persons involved. This multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics, deployment of detection technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, based on the introduction of stringent supply chain controls, the implementation from April 2015 of a new fuel marker here and in the UK, and rigorous enforcement action. </p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue cooperates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against these illicit trades, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of these forms of criminality. I believe that this work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime will be supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of "A Fresh Start: The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan", of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Revenue's programmes of action against these criminal activities have achieved notable successes. During 2015, some 68 million illicit cigarettes and 2,364 kilograms of illicit tobacco were seized, and there were 40 and 75 convictions, respectively, for tobacco smuggling and the sale of illicit tobacco products.  In addition, 15 filling stations were closed down and 215,000 litres of fuel were seized during the year, bringing total closures and seizures since 2011 to 149 stations and more than 3 million litres. 31 fuel laundries, where prescribed markers were illegally removed from fuel, were also detected and shut down during that time. The industry view is that the measures implemented have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over recent years. An analysis of long-term consumption trends for road diesel and marked diesel in Ireland undertaken by Revenue also pointed to a significant change in the pattern of consumption following implementation of the anti-fraud measures.</p>  <p>  For my part, I have acted to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the statutory powers necessary for undertaking this important work. </p>  <p>  In the case of tobacco, measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed tobacco products. In the Finance Act 2013, I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purpose of illegal tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 strengthened the obligation of a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination. The measure also allows any bag or other receptacle that is reasonably believed to contain tobacco products that are concerned in an offence to be searched.</p>  <p>  In relation to fuel, action was taken to ensure the necessary legislative underpinning for a range of key initiatives, including the strengthening of the licensing regime for auto fuel traders, the introduction of a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders, the putting in place of new requirements for recording and reporting of fuel transactions, and the introduction of the new fuel marker. Revenue's ability to combat fuel fraud was strengthened also by the introduction, in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, of a provision making a supplier who is reckless in supplying fuel for a purpose connected with excise fraud liable for duty at the standard rate of tax. In the Finance Act 2014, Revenue's entitlement to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence was augmented to cover situations including where a trader does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, as a result of these initiatives, the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against fuel and tobacco offences, and I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that action against such activities will continue to be a central element of their work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-19a.275.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011900058#WRF01600"><p>Since 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured. Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.  Prior to this, income tax relief for medical insurance premiums was provided at source, at the standard rate of income tax, on the entire premium amount regardless of cost. Therefore, the State was paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums. </p>  <p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance increased significantly in the years leading up to the introduction of the caps in Budget 2014, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011 and &euro;448 million in 2012. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the numbers insured were estimated to have reduced by approximately 150,000 over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs was unsustainable. If the relief had remained unchanged and the trend was to continue, it was estimated that the cost of the relief would have increased to approximately &euro;1 billion per annum by 2020.</p>  <p>  Relief through the tax system effectively means that some taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, provide financial support to those individuals who can afford such insurance. In my view, taking into account the increasing costs and reducing coverage outlined above, it was unfair and unsustainable to allow unrestricted tax relief on private medical insurance premiums, particularly at a time when the general population has contributed so much to repairing the public finances. The ceilings ensure a level of continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the 2009 Commission on Taxation recommended the retention of medical insurance relief, but that it should be limited. The introduction in Budget 2014 of an upper ceiling on the amount of medical insurance premiums that qualify for tax relief achieved this recommendation.  </p>  <p>  The potential yield to the Exchequer in 2014 of restricting tax relief on private medical insurance policies to the first &euro;1,000 of a premium is tentatively estimated to be in the order of &euro;151 million. This yield takes into account the difference between the actual cost of the relief in 2014 and the potential cost of an unrestricted relief, taking into account the increased numbers of policy holders following the introduction of lifetime community rating in 2014.</p>  <p>  When the cap was introduced in Budget 2014, it was estimated that the yield to the Exchequer would be approximately &euro;94 million in the first year and &euro;127 million in a full year.  The reduction in overall Exchequer cost from the last full year in which unrestricted relief was available (&euro;448 million in 2012) was &euro;94 million in 2014 and &euro;123 million in 2015, based on the current estimates for Exchequer costs in those years of &euro;354 million and &euro;325 million respectively.   On this basis, I am satisfied that the projected Exchequer yield in Budget 2014 was accurate, and that the current caps are functioning appropriately and as intended.</p></reply>

Additional revenue arising from discretionary measures increases the overall fiscal space while the converse in relation to revenue reductions also applies.  </p>  <p>  The medium term fiscal space projections set out in Budget 2016 are not final as they are based on projections for the GDP deflators, reference rates, convergence margins and general government expenditure outturns for each of the relevant years. The actual GDP deflators, reference rates and convergence margins values used to assess compliance with the rules each year will be set by the European Commission using their estimates compiled in their Spring and Autumn forecasts.

As the deputy will know, in December of 2015, AIB successfully completed the reorganisation of the bank's capital, including the return of almost &euro;1.7 billion to the exchequer from the redemption of Preference Shares. This was possible because the bank have made significant progress on a number of fronts, such as returning to profitability, reducing non-performing loans and increasing lending into the Irish economy. In this context, I think it prudent to explore the options available to us, with a view to ultimately recouping the significant investments that the State made in AIB during the financial crisis. </p>  <p>  There is still work to be done in assessing how we might structure our gradual exit from the bank and particularly when we should start this process. My Department have recently appointed an Independent Financial Advisor, Rothschild, to provide advice in this regard.

Where legacy issues remain in the sector - such as the elevated, though declining, number of mortgages in arrears - it is the remit of the Central Bank to monitor these and intervene where required. All progress toward a more stable and active banking sector will have positive implications for the value of the State's shareholdings in the banks.</p></reply>

While the TFEU does not give a precise definition of what is meant by price stability the ECB's Governing Council has defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below (but close to) 2%.</p>  <p>  The TFEU provides, at Article 130, for the independence of the ECB, the ESCB and national central banks in carrying out the tasks and duties conferred on them by the Treaties and in particular that the "Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks".</p>  <p>  In this context, I should point out that inflation in the euro area has been below levels consistent with price stability for some time. The "flash" estimate shows the euro area annual rate is expected to be 0.2 per cent in December 2015 and inflation has been close to zero over 2015. The ECB's priority is  to return inflation to levels consistent with price stability.  In January 2015, the ECB decided to take additional monetary policy measures as it considered  the prevailing degree of monetary accommodation to be insufficient to adequately address heightened risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. </p>  <p>  In that regard, under the ECB's Expanded Asset Purchase Programme ("Quantitative Easing"), the eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area) has been purchasing &euro;60 billion of public and private assets per month and plan to do so until at least March 2017, or until there is an improvement in inflation to levels consistent with price stability.</p></reply>

The arrangement will always include an interest element, which is a statutory charge that Revenue has no discretion on, and will require a clear commitment from the taxpayer/business to pay future taxes as they fall due.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that cases are only referred to the Sheriff or to an external solicitor as a last alternative where discussions with the taxpayer/business have failed to resolve the issue.  Once a tax debt is referred to the Sheriff or external solicitor, Revenue generally ceases to negotiate directly with the taxpayer/business.</p>  <p>  Revenue does of course continue to negotiate directly with the taxpayer/business on all issues other than the specific debt that was referred to the Sheriff or external solicitor.  Revenue may also, in exceptional circumstances, agree to re-engage with the taxpayer/business in relation to the referred debt where relevant and previously unknown issues subsequently arise.  However any such re-engagement will require the taxpayer/business to firstly pay any fees or expenses already incurred by the enforcement agent.</p>  <p>  If there are particular issues that have arisen in a case since it was referred for debt collection/enforcement, then the Deputy should advise the taxpayer/business to make immediate contact with Revenue.  If there are no emerging issues, the Deputy should advise the taxpayer/business to engage with the Sheriff or external solicitor who have discretion to agree a mutually suitable payment arrangement.</p>  <p>  Revenue has taken a very proactive approach to taxpayers/businesses experiencing difficulty in paying their taxes. I strongly advise any taxpayers/ businesses in difficulty to engage early with Revenue and not to ignore demands for payment.  Enforcement is a last resort and the system would cease to work effectively if following referral the taxpayer/business could re-open negotiations directly with Revenue.</p></reply>

The declared valuation is not affected by any repairs or improvements made to a property or by any general increase or decrease in property prices that might occur over the course of the valuation period.</p>  <p>  The date that determines if a property owner is liable for LPT for any given year is known as the 'liability date'. The 'liability date' is set by the LPT Act as 1 November in the preceding year and the owner on this date is liable to pay LPT for the following year.  For example, the 'liability date' for the year 2016 is 1 November 2015.  If a property becomes uninhabitable after that date the liability for 2016 remains due.</p>  <p>  The LPT Act does not provide for revised or reduced valuations on foot of occurrences such as the recent flooding.  However, initial analysis by Revenue indicates that the majority of properties situated on affected 'flood plains' are already valued in the lowest Valuation Band and the question of a reduction in value does not therefore arise.</p>  <p>  Revenue recently announced that it is making the LPT Deferral and Partial Deferral relief available to property owners, in respect of the 2016 liability, whose principal private residence was flooded during the recent bad weather.  The relief is available to the people affected, regardless of whether they qualify under the normal Deferral/Partial Deferral criteria as set down in Part 12 of the LPT Act, providing they are in receipt of assistance through the Department of Social Protection Humanitarian Relief Fund.</p>  <p>  For clarity, Part 12 of the LPT Act provides for Deferral, and Partial Deferral (50%) schemes that can apply to liable property owners under certain conditions including, 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and also to 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum and the duration of the relief normally coincides with the valuation period (1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019). </p>  <p>  It may however arise that certain properties have suffered damage and have become uninhabitable and will not be repaired by 1 November 2016 and will be unfit for occupation by the property owner. Such properties, once they are not occupied at 1 November 2016, will not be liable for LPT for 2017.</p>  <p>  Property owners who wish to avail of the deferral option or require clarification in regard to their particular circumstances should contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255 to make the necessary arrangements.  Revenue has assured me that any queries or requests for deferral will be prioritised and responses will be issued without delay.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has provided a number of supports to persons affected by flooding including the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). </p></reply>

Wexford. </p><p>A flood relief scheme is being progressed by Wexford County Council for Enniscorthy.  The River Slaney (Enniscorthy) Flood Relief Scheme was publicly exhibited in 2009 but due to significant local opposition did not proceed to Confirmation stage at that point.  Taking on board comments received during the exhibition, amendments were made to the outline design.  Consultants were recently appointed by the Council to complete the detailed design both for the flood defences and the new bridge.  It is hoped to have the designs completed mid-2016 and pending any objections following further public consultation, the scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for confirmation.  It is hoped to be in a position to appoint contractors early in 2017.</p><p>The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme is currently being undertaken by the OPW in partnership with local authorities and other stakeholders, in line with national flood policy and the EU Directive (2007/EC/60).  The South Eastern CFRAM Study is one of six regional studies that are assessing flood risk in 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) deemed to be at potentially significant risk and impact from flooding.  Good progress is being made on the Study which is assessing the areas of Blackwater, Bunclody, Courtown, Gorey, Kilmore, New Ross &amp;amp; Environs and Wexford including the North &amp;amp; South Slobs.</p><p>Enniscorthy is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) under the South Eastern CFRAM study.  The flood relief scheme for this location will cover the River Slaney within the town centre. An area called Cherry Orchard is within Enniscorthy AFA and is located on the Urrin, a tributary of the Slaney. The South Eastern CFRAM Study has developed mapping and will pursue options to address flood risk, for the Cherry Orchard location, separate to the Flood Relief Scheme. </p><p>Flood Maps for these AFAs will be finalised shortly and are being informed by a local Public Consultation held in March 2015 and a Statutory Public Consultation that closed in December 2015.  </p><p>Work on the identification of appropriate and feasible flood risk management options is underway.  A local Public Consultation on the options for Wexford and the North and South Slobs was held on 15<sup></sup>December and local consultations for other Co. Wexford AFAs are being scheduled for the coming weeks. Further information is available on .</p><p>Following the identification of feasible flood risk management options, Flood Risk Management Plans will be prepared and published for public consultation during summer 2016.  The Plans will set out specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a proactive and comprehensive way. The Government recently announced &euro;430m for capital flood relief works as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021.  This increased level of funding will allow for the prioritised investment for the Flood Risk Management Plans over the coming years.</p><p>Identifying and addressing localised flooding is a matter for Wexford County Council in the first instance.  It is open to the Council to undertake any local flood mitigation works using its own resources or to submit an application for funding, if necessary, under the Office of Public Works (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria available on the OPW website, .</p><p>The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance in the county.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes (Ballyteigue/Kilmore and Owenavarragh) completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  Wexford County Council is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of certain watercourses within Drainage Districts in the county for arterial drainage works completed prior to 1945.</p></reply>

The fiscal adjustment implemented in order that Ireland could successfully exit the troika programme and return sustainability to our public finances required significant expenditure reductions and tax increases.  Gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of just over &euro;63 billion in 2009 to &euro;54 billion in 2014. </p>  <p>  Budget 2015 marked a turning point in our fiscal and economic recovery, with expenditure reductions no longer being required to meet our fiscal targets.  The Government was in a position to make some targeted increases in selected areas.  Further, with the economy performing strongly and Exchequer tax receipts over &euro;3 billion ahead of profile in 2015, additional funding was made available through Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.4 billion to support key services and social supports.  This brought gross current expenditure in the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education to over 81% of all gross current expenditure for 2015, reflecting the Government's priority to protect key public services and social supports.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the size of the State essentially refers to the resources it has available to it and the services it provides within those resources.  My Department included some trend analysis on the size of the State over time in the 2014 Expenditure Report which is available on the Department's website. </p>  <p>  Data between 1983 and 2014 show that in real terms the State's expenditure tripled in size but as a proportion of the overall size of the economy, spend varied around a long term average of 30% of GDP.  This reflects changes in both the size of the economy and expenditure.</p>  <p>  In making comparisons with the rest of the European Union, the Deputy will also be aware that the basis for the comparison can have a significant impact. Expenditure compared against GDP, GNP or a hybrid of the two may give different results.  Adjusting for the demographic profile of the population can also impact on the comparisons.</p>  <p>  Including the additional amounts provided by way of Supplementary Estimate, General Government Expenditure, excluding debt interest, is forecast for 2015 at just under 32% of GDP and 37&frac12;% of GNP.  As a proportion of the overall economy, Government spending is roughly the same size it was in 2001 and is broadly in line with the trend over time.</p>  <p>  Ireland is on track to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure with a general government deficit close to 1&frac12;% of GDP for 2015.  Budget 2016 was therefore framed under the rules that apply under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The Revised Estimates for Public Services ("REV") 2016 set out further sustainable increases in public expenditure.  The increases provided in the REV demonstrate the Government's commitment to investment in public services and assisting those most in need while ensuring that the public finances are managed on a sustainable basis.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to capital investment, the Capital Plan announced an exchequer capital spend of &euro;27 billion over six years.   If we add investment from the wider semi-state sector, and off-balance sheet mechanisms such as PPPs, total state investment amounts to &euro;42 billion over the period.  </p>  <p>  The &euro;27 billion Exchequer component of the Capital Plan, supplemented by the new &euro;500 million phase of the PPP programme, is primarily targeted at addressing priority needs in transport, education, housing and health care.  Investments will be made in public transport, including commencement of a metro project in Dublin, new and upgraded schools, Primary and continuing care health facilities, and social housing. Investments will also be made to mitigate risks from flooding.  There will also be continued investment to support job creation.</p></reply>

There are currently two major flood relief schemes being undertaken in the specific areas mentioned, the largest being the scheme on the River Dodder where works have been completed on the tidal section and works are ongoing on the section at risk from fluvial flooding. Significant works and investment have been undertaken to date on this scheme with further works continuing into 2017. Another scheme on the South Campshires (Sir John Rogerson&rsquo;s Quay) in the City commenced in 2014 and will be completed later this year. Both these schemes are being undertaken with DCC acting as the Contracting Authority and the OPW acting as the funding agency and undertaking the works using its direct labour force.</p>  <p>  Other schemes have been completed in recent years on the River Tolka and on a section of the River Wad. There are also a number of Schemes in the early stages of planning for the City and County which involve a partnership with all the relevant local authorities and these include the Rivers Poddle and Camac in the City and projects for Portmarnock and Skerries on which Fingal County Council will take the lead.</p>  <p>  The details of the flood defence scheme works already completed in the areas in question have been provided to insurance companies as part of the arrangements agreed between the OPW and Insurance Ireland under a Memorandum of Understanding of March 2014. The insurance companies have agreed to take these works into account in the provision of flood insurance cover in the areas benefitting from the works.  This should allow businesses in the areas in question to obtain flood insurance cover at affordable rates. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the details of the flood relief schemes currently under construction and those yet to commence, will, when completed, be provided to the insurance companies also.</p>  <p>  The management of flood risk in Dublin city and county is being addressed also in a comprehensive way under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme for the East Region. Good progress is being made on the East CFRAM Project which is a part of the overall national CFRAM Programme which, in turn, is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and forms the strategic focus of national flood risk management policy. The national Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs), including 90 coastal areas, identified as being at potentially significant risk from flooding. The CFRAM Programme, which includes the assessment of a number of river catchment areas within Co. Dublin, involves the production of predictive flood hazard and risk mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans containing a prioritised list of measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified. The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State Investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis taking into account social, environmental and economic factors.</p>  <p>  Under the CFRAM Programme to date, Flood Risk Management Plans have been produced for the Fingal-East Meath and River Dodder catchment Study areas. The Eastern CFRAM Study is assessing the remaining identified significant flood risk areas in Co. Dublin. Draft mapping is now being finalised following conclusion of the national statutory public consultation on 23 December 2015. Work on the development of preliminary options to address the significant flood risks identified is underway. Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the Eastern CFRAM Flood Risk Management Plans are scheduled to be published for public consultation during summer 2016 and completed at end 2016. Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie. Considerable work is being undertaken therefore to protect businesses in Dublin city and county from future flooding and associated losses. Should a future flooding event result in the question of financial assistance for businesses affected arising, this will be a matter for consideration by Government at that time.</p></reply>

The building was selected having regard to a number of key criteria including location, size, accessibility, condition and rent. The leased buildings in Ballybay amount to 7,062 sq ft while the lease in Monaghan Town is 5,045 sq ft which includes nearly 1,200 sq ft of basement storage space. Having regard to rent, the annual rent for the lease in Monaghan town is &euro;39,500. This is materially less than the current rents, &euro;53,427, in Ballybay, and will result in an ongoing annual saving to the Exchequer. The Commissioners are also of the view that the new rent in Monaghan is at a competitive market level having regard to the quality and location of the building.

Furthermore, Ireland is on track to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) with a general government deficit of close to 1&frac12;% of GDP for 2015.</p>  <p>  In 2016, Ireland will become subject to the preventive arm of the SGP. Adherence to the rules of the preventive arm will regulate the growth in public expenditure in line with the medium term potential growth rate of the economy, thereby making sure that the level of spending is sustainable and can continue to be supported by the economy.</p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within Budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Department, and important measures are in place to help ensure that these budgetary targets continue to be met.  My Department is in regular communication with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored against the published expenditure profiles. There is regular reporting to Government on these matters, and information is published monthly, as part of the Exchequer Statement. With the move to the preventive arm of the SGP in 2016 it is important that Departments manage expenditure within their allocations as set out in Revised Estimated Volume ('REV') 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to fiscal targets for 2015, end-year Exchequer returns indicate that the General Government Deficit will be close to 1&frac12;% of GDP, well below the 2.1% forecast at the time of Budget 2016. Overall voted expenditure for the year has come in below the amount approved by the D&aacute;il by way of original estimate and supplementary estimate.</p>  <p>  With 2015 tax revenues exceeding forecast by over &euro;3 billion, the Government was in a position to provide additional funding to a number of Departments by way of supplementary estimate. The additional expenditure represents a responsible approach towards ensuring that public services are adequately funded to meet social and economic objectives both in 2015 and in 2016. The allocation of additional resources should also be viewed in the context of the significant fiscal consolidation implemented in order to return sustainability to the public finances.</p>  <p>  Public Service Reform was a key element of the Government's response to the crisis and continues to be an essential part of our strategy for recovery. Significant progress has been made since the publication of the Government's first Public Service Reform Plan in 2011 that has helped improve productivity and deliver benefits across a range of specific areas such as greater openness and transparency, digital government, shared services, procurement reform and property management.</p>  <p>  A second Public Service Reform Plan (2014-2016) was published in January 2014.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes.  The actions set out in the Reform Plan address areas such as: greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity to deliver reform.  A comprehensive Progress Report on the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 was published in March of last year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-19a.387.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011900060#WRH02400"><p>The key issue faced by the Government in seeking to deliver infrastructural projects continues to be the fiscal space available to Government under the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth, which impacts on the Government's ability to increase expenditure, including on capital projects.  Any funding that would be raised through the issuing of new Government Bonds, as suggested in the question, would not be off-balance sheet and therefore any such funding raised would have no impact on the fiscal space available to the Government, nor would it provide any additional capacity for further Exchequer expenditure without equivalent spending cuts in other areas or tax increases.</p>  <p>  In terms of the ability to deliver additional public infrastructure on an off-balance sheet basis, in General Government terms, the scope to do so under Eurostat rules is constrained.  Public Private Partnerships are the only recognised mechanism by which this can be done at present, and the Government has already agreed to a new &euro;500 m third phase of the PPP programme which was announced in the Capital Plan.  However, PPPs impose long term financial commitments over a very long period of time (up to 40 years), which increase over time as new PPPs come on stream thus absorbing an increasing amount of the Government's discretionary capital expenditure allocation on an annual basis.  Accordingly, the use of PPPs must be carefully planned, and controlled, in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.</p>  <p>  The possibility of identifying other options to assist in delivering key public infrastructure on an off-balance sheet basis continues to be explored, in particular in the context of delivering on the commitments in the Government's Social Housing Strategy and the potential to use the &euro;400 m earmarked for this purpose from the proceeds of the sale of Bord Gais Energy.  However, identifying a suitable mechanism that is capable of meeting the Eurostat requirements for classification as off-balance sheet is proving challenging.  The Government remains open to the possibility of using such off-balance sheet options, if suitable options can be identified, to supplement direct Exchequer investment and assist with the delivery of critical national infrastructure on a timely basis, provided that this can be done on a sustainable and affordable basis.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recognise that maintaining fiscal sustainability and economic stability under the Government's fiscal framework will ensure that Ireland retains the hard-won restored confidence of international financial markets to meet its ongoing funding needs.  This is central to the continuance of Ireland's economic recovery, securing further reductions in unemployment, achieving further gains in living standards and ensuring the continued development of our public services.</p></reply>

The reforms we have implemented over the past five years have enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of necessary reductions in staff numbers and budgets, and at a time of increased demand for public services.</p><p>Following on from strong progress on the implementation of the Government's first Public Service Reform Plan (2011), our second Reform Plan was published in January 2014 and sets out the priorities for reform for the period 2014 to 2016.  While maintaining an emphasis on efficiency and reducing costs, this Plan puts a particular focus on improved service delivery and achieving better outcomes for service users.</p><p>We are implementing a broad range of reforms, with over 230 specific actions set out in this Reform Plan.  This includes, for example, more digital delivery of services and improved engagement with service users; implementation of shared services and alternative models of service delivery; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; and increased accountability and transparency in public decision making.</p><p>Good progress is being made on the implementation of the Reform Plan, as outlined in the Annual Progress Report on Public Service Reform, which I published in March last year. A copy of the report was sent to all Members of the Oireachtas and it is also available at . It is intended to publish the second Annual Progress Report on Public Service Reform in the coming months.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Taoiseach and I published the Civil Service Renewal Plan in October 2014 which sets out a three year action plan and is leading to major changes right across the Civil Service.  A Progress Report on achievements in the 'first 200 days' was published last July and is also available on my Department's website.  Since then, work has continued on the remaining actions in the Plan and a further Progress Report detailing the progress made during the second phase of implementation will be published in early summer.</p><p>Overall, I am satisfied that we have made very strong progress on Public Service Reform. A focus on reform and continuous improvement must be an essential element in the strategy of all Departments and Offices. Therefore, I believe that reform should continue to be a key element of any future strategy.</p></reply>

The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is an independent, statutory body which was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 (No. 16 of 2015).  It assumes the roles and functions previously carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), Equality Tribunal (ET), Labour Relations Commission (LRC), Rights Commissioners Service (RCS), and the first-instance (Complaints and Referrals) functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT).  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 cover employees in both the public and private sectors as well as applicants for employment and training. The Acts outlaw discrimination in work-related areas such as pay, vocational training, access to employment, work experience and promotion. Cases involving harassment and victimisation at work are also covered by the Acts. The publication of discriminatory advertisements and discrimination by employment agencies, vocational training bodies and certain other bodies, e.g. trades unions and employer associations, is outlawed. An employee or prospective employee may make a claim if he or she is of the view that discrimination on any of the nine prohibited grounds has occurred. The grounds are Gender, Civil status, Family status, Sexual orientation, Religious belief, Age, Disability, Race colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins and Membership of the Traveller community.</p><p>Discrimination outside the workplace is covered by the Equal Status Acts. The Acts outlaw discrimination in all services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector. These include facilities for refreshment, entertainment, banking, insurance, grants, credit facilities, transport and travel services. Discrimination in the disposal of premises, provision of accommodation, admission or access to educational courses or establishments is also prohibited subject to some exemptions.</p><p>The nine grounds on which discrimination is outlawed are Gender, Civil status, Family status, Sexual orientation, Religious belief, Age, Disability, Race and Membership of the Traveller community. The legislation covers many different goods and services. It includes access to a place, facilities for banking, entertainment, cultural activities or transport, professional or trade services, health services, access to education and accommodation.</p><p>Complaints under the Equality legislation can be made to the WRC and they will be heard by an Adjudication Officer who can order redress as set out in the Acts if a finding of discrimination is made.</p><p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) is an independent statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality which has been established to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland. It is Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution recognised as such by the United Nations. It is also Ireland&rsquo;s National Equality Body for the purpose of  EU Law. I understand that IHREC may grant legal assistance to individuals seeking to vindicate their human rights in the State such as by providing legal advice and legal representation before the Courts.

The University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.  The study, published in November, 2015, found that zero hour contracts as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with &ldquo;If and when&rdquo; hours only or a hybrid of the two. If and when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>  <p>  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made in it are those of UL.

Since C&amp;C purchased MJ Gleeson a number of years ago the company has been engaged in restructuring of certain elements of its business.  The decision announced on 12 January is part of a company-wide restructuring particularly of its manufacturing base which the company has undertaken following the loss of contracts for private label water which has led to serious under utilisation of capacity.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to senior management at the company in recent days and urged them to reconsider the decision in relation to the facility in Borrisoleigh but unfortunately this did not prove possible.</p>  <p>  The Group announced that following a detailed review of its manufacturing and operational footprint, it intends to consolidate production from sites in Shepton Mallet in England and in Borrisoleigh into its manufacturing site in Clonmel. Under this proposal, production and packaging will be transferred on a phased basis from the facility in Borrisoleigh. Consequently, Clonmel will become the core manufacturing site for Bulmers and Magners cider, Tipperary Water and the company&rsquo;s range of niche premium beers and ciders.  In support of the proposal, the Group will invest in excess of &euro;10 million in enhancing packaging and logistics capability in Clonmel, creating 80 additional jobs, and designed to put Irish-based employment on a secure and competitive footing. The company has indicated that Borrisoleigh will remain as a key transport hub and both logistics and warehousing operations will be maintained in the town.</p>  <p>  The company has indicated that, where possible, the workers at Borrisoleigh will be offered alternative employment at the expansion in Clonmel.  Regrettably, net roles lost in Ireland across the company&rsquo;s operational network are estimated to be 54 jobs.  I note the company&rsquo;s statement that it will provide support and training for the workers affected. In addition, all the supports of the State will be made available.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with the company as it undertakes restructuring. The Agency will continue to monitor the situation at the company and will continue to offer any assistance that it can within Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s remit.</p>  <p>  I understand that the company has initiated the consultation process with its employees and their representatives who are impacted by the announcement. The company plans to meet with employee and union representatives over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Workplace Relations Commission information staff are available to meet staff of the affected enterprise, either individually or collectively, to assist the parties concerned.</p>  <p>  The State agencies will continue to work closely with each other, and with local interests, to seek new investment for County Tipperary.</p></reply>

The LEOs provide advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business. They can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, in certain circumstances, and other non-financial supports.  For example, with regard to the financial supports available, it should be noted that the LEOs generally grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities. However, there are other non-financial supports available, such as mentoring and training, and the LEO staff can advise as to which supports would be most appropriate.</p><p>In addition, any business can use the LEOs to access finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises (employing less than 10 people) with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO.

The negotiation in respect of regulatory cooperation will ensure that economic gains do not lower our high standards in the field of labour rights, the environment or consumer&rsquo;s health and safety.  This principle is built into the negotiating mandate which guides the Commission in these negotiations.  The aim of the negotiations is closer cooperation by making present and future rules more compatible, reducing the cost of unnecessary red tape by making it easier for companies&rsquo; to comply with both EU and US laws while ensuring food, animal and plant imports are safe.  Regulatory cooperation and coherence recognises the realities of globalisation and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable, which is particularly important to SME&rsquo;s to internationalise and grow exports.</p></reply>

I also note that the Deputy&rsquo;s party proposed such a Zone in a policy document last year.  The possible development of a Border Development Zone could raise significant issues involving EU State Aid Rules and other EU provisions and it would also, of course, require detailed negotiations between both administrations on this island.  There would also be significant resource issues, which would be challenging. I am not aware that detailed costings have been carried out in relation to the proposal. I expect that these would obviously depend of the exact nature and functions of such a body. As you will be aware, this Government have initiated a significant reduction in the number of Bodies and Agencies, in order  to achieve more effective administration and delivery of services, so that a very strong case needs to be made to justify the creation of new bodies. I would again emphasise that any new structures to be put in place would require the full agreement of the Northern Ireland authorities.  Both administrations on the island are focussed on developing the existing mechanisms and on making them work better.</p><p>Developing new, regionally-based, economic structures could be a significant policy development, and one requiring careful consideration. The need to avoid duplication would be paramount, in the interests of utilising scarce State resources efficiently.  It is therefore worth noting that there are already several mechanisms in place to pursue cross border economic development.</p><p>I strongly believe that we should continue to build on the structures already in place and on what has been achieved in that region.  The work of the Cross Border Body, <i>InterTradeIreland,</i>has been foremost in this regard, with a significant range of enterprise development initiatives and programmes in place. My Department jointly funds and provides oversight to this Body, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast, and it represents a very effective mechanism for tackling business development on an all-island basis. In addition, there is on-going co-operation between <i>Enterprise Ireland</i>and its Northern Ireland counterpart agency, <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>on areas of mutual interest.</p><p>Over recent years, a range of projects under the Enterprise Development theme of the INTERREG IVA Programme (2009-2015) have made a significant impact on developing small businesses in the region.  My Department co-funded this strand of this INTERREG Programme, under which a total of 28 individual projects have been initiated. I now look forward to the roll out of the successor Programme for the period up to 2020, which will support Research and Innovation initiatives.</p><p>The operation of the North South Ministerial Council, in which I fully participate, both in its Plenary format and also in the Trade and Business Sectoral format with my counterpart from the Northern Ireland Executive, is an ongoing forum which can develop practical North South initiatives.</p></reply>

This included the introduction of an electronic mapping facility in 2012 which allowed for more accurate updating of land parcels, fewer penalties for farmers and faster processing of applications.  The introduction of the new Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 necessitated a new online application system for farmers and agricultural agents. My officials devised a farmer friendly system that ensured Irish farmers complied with the new CAP regime, especially the new requirements under Greening.</p>  <p>  Following the introduction of the new system which involved complex programming issues a problem arose for 678 applicants who drew maps on an amendment form &ndash; these maps were not visible to farmers or their agents. However it&rsquo;s important to stress that at no point were these maps lost. It is also important to note that farmers were not disadvantaged as a result of this issue and the applications were processed as normal.</p>  <p>  In advance of the 2016 BPS application period, this issue has been resolved, and the new on-line system is being finalised a long with other improvements with the intention of continuing the progress made in the submission of on-line applications.

Under the 2015 ANC Scheme, eligible applicants are required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a retention period of seven consecutive months and to maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  Payment under the ANC scheme has not issued in this case as the holding concerned has not satisfied the scheme&rsquo;s minimum stocking density requirements.  It is noted that the person named has a restriction on his file due to a National Parks and Wildlife Services plan where livestock can only be held for 3 months on 24.40 hectares of designated lands.  However, the remaining 1.91 hectares of land is not designated under National Parks and Wildlife Services plan and is required to meet stocking rules. </p>  <p>  A formal decision on this matter issued to the person named on 1 December 2015.

While the person named meets the eligibility conditions for the National Reserve in all other respects, he holds neither &lsquo;naked land&rsquo; nor low value entitlements on which an allocation from the National Reserve can be made.  A letter has issued to the person named informing him of the decision in relation to his application.  The application under the Young Farmers Scheme has been fully processed and payment is due to issue in the coming days.</p></reply>

The hectares declared must be eligible and must have an agricultural activity carried out on them  The governing EU regulations define an agricultural activity as the production, rearing or growing of agricultural products, including harvesting, milking, breeding animals, and keeping animals for farming purposes and maintaining an agricultural area in a state which makes it suitable for grazing or cultivation.  An applicant is free to choose an activity that best suits their farming enterprise and if s/he so wishes can choose to just top the land.</p><p>Where an officially approved environmental management plan under the Birds or Habitats Directives requires certain management practices to be conducted on agricultural areas, such management practices will take precedence in determining the level of agricultural activity to be conducted on agricultural areas declared for payment.</p><p>Article 32(2)(b)(i) of Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 provides that an eligible hectare is any area which gave a right to payments in 2008 under the single payment scheme and which no longer complies with the definition of 'eligible hectare' as a result of the implementation of Directive 92/43/EEC, Directive 2000/60/EC and Directive 2009/147/EC.</p><p>In that regard, the 2015 BPS Terms and Conditions set out details with regard to land eligibility and payments.  Section 1.7 refers to land eligibility and states that in order to draw down payment in respect of BPS entitlements, applicants must have an &ldquo;eligible hectare&rdquo; to accompany each entitlement.  An eligible hectare is land that is used for an agricultural activity. </p><p>Section 1.7 of the Terms and Conditions further makes reference to The Birds and Habitats Directives and provides that land that no longer complies with the definition of eligible hectare as a result of the implementation of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds or Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora is eligible for payment where the following conditions are met:</p><p>-The land must have been claimed under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>-The land must have been eligible for payment under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p>-Any increase in the ineligible area should be directly linked to the  management requirements for the habitat.</p><p>Where an applicant is claiming on land that is otherwise considered ineligible, such land will be deemed eligible for payment where the applicant satisfies the requirements as set out above. </p><p>In relation to the percentage of land in Connemara with an environmental designation, my Department, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, will compile the data requested and forward this directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

There is no maximum waiting period for an application for a herd number. The length of time required to process an individual application is contingent on a number of factors such as the timely response of the applicant in providing the required documentation and proof that the applicant is entitled to use the lands that are the subject of the herd number application. Under normal circumstances, the average waiting period from the time of receipt of the application to the allocation of a herd number is approximately three weeks.</p><p><table><tr><th><font

Applicants who already hold existing entitlement which are below the national average value will receive a top-up whereby the value of those entitlements will be increased to the national average value.</p><p>The provision known as the Scottish Derogation allows for the allocation of entitlements to persons who never held Single Payment entitlements but who actively farmed during the 2013 scheme yearand can provide verifiable evidence of agricultural production. Such allocation is available to eligible farmers who &lsquo;produced, reared or grew agricultural products&rsquo; in 2013 in the beef, dairy, sheep and arable sectors.</p><p>There is no upper age limit for qualification for an allocation of entitlements under these two measures/schemes.</p></reply>

EU Regulations governing the administration of these schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including in some cases on farm inspections, be completed before any payments issue.  The 2015 Basic Payment Scheme/Areas of Natural Constraint application of the person named was selected for a remote sensing inspection. This inspection resulted in a reduction in the area claimed 19.62 ha to a found area of 14.34 ha. As the amount of entitlements held by the person named is lower than the amount of area claimed, there was no monetary reduction under the Basic Payment Scheme and payments due issued to the nominated bank account on 17 December 2015.  This inspection resulted in findings of an over-declaration in area of greater than 20% in respect of the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme . Based on the terms and conditions of the scheme   this resulted in no payment in respect of that scheme. The person named was informed of this outcome on 18 December 2015. The person named has appealed this decision and this request is currently being examined. The person named will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of this review, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office, within 3 months.</p></reply>

I am guided in this context by the long-term sectoral development strategies as set out in Food Wise 2025 and I am confident that these initiatives, in conjunction with the Rural Development Programme, will lead to continued growth in terms of profitability and efficiency of the sector as whole. As with any Minister for Agriculture in the EU, I can have no role in influencing commodity prices in Ireland. I do note however that 2015 was a relatively positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average nearly 8% higher compared to 2014.  The primary determinant of prices in any market is the relationship between supply and demand. Price variations in different EU beef markets reflect prevailing conditions in those markets. With regard to the price differential between Irish and UK cattle, a number of factors have been identified to explain why Irish-born cattle command lower prices than their British equivalents. These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market. Last year, Ireland exported approximately 272,000 tonnes of beef, worth in the region of &euro;1.1 billion to the UK. This constituted 54% of the volume and 52% of the value of Irish beef exports and as such, the UK is overwhelmingly Ireland&rsquo;s most important export market.</p>  <p>  I attach substantial importance to the live export trade and my Department has been very proactive during my time as Minister in facilitating both the cross-border live trade and shipments of animals overseas. Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for cattle farmers in Ireland. It is expected that 2016 will see an increase in the export of live cattle. Improving economic situations in Italy and Spain are expected to boost demand for Irish cattle and general demand for calves for veal are expected to remain strong.</p>  <p>  Last year, live exports to all markets amounted to almost 180,000 head. Geopolitical instability in North Africa, a new veterinary regime in relation to IBR in Belgium and increased domestic prices lead to a reduction in live exports. Exports to Northern Ireland, the Netherlands and France rose, while exports to Belgium, Italy, Spain and Britain declined. Bord Bia has forecast that live exports to Italy and Spain, two traditional live export destinations, should increase in 2016 on foot on economic recovery in those economies and disease outbreaks in certain supplier regions.</p>  <p>  There are currently three dedicated and three roll on-roll off vessels approved for the carriage of livestock by sea form Irish ports. Three more vessels are currently at various stages of the process for similar approval.</p></reply>

The Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme 2014-2020 provides very generous grants of up to &euro;5,750 per hectare to cover the full cost of planting, along with annual premiums of up to &euro;635 per hectare per year for 15 years. The rate of grant and premium is dependent on the species of tree planted, with native broadleaf species attracting the highest grant and premium rates. Details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website </p><p>These grant and premium payments are available to all landowners, both farmers and non-farmers.</p><p>The Afforestation Scheme supports the planting of 12 different categories of forests, including commercial conifer forests, commercial broadleaf forests and native woodlands. In 2014 two new forest categories were introduced to provide additional options for farmers. The Agro-forestry category aims to encourage farmers to combine livestock grazing with forestry, while the Forestry for Fibre category will allow farmers to plant forestry for the renewable energy or pulpwood markets on a 10-15 year crop rotation.</p><p>With regard to taxation, in Budget 2016 the High Income Earners Restriction, which formerly applied to income from forestry, was removed completely for active foresters and farmers. As a result, a taxation averaging regime is not necessary because following Budget 2016 the income earned from clear-felling will now be tax-free.</p></reply>

The model instrument aims to help ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses. Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). No such funding has been allocated by the EIB or under Irelands RDP to date.  I am considering whether to include Financial Instruments (FIs) in Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme. Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments and the funding for any such FIs would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding. It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.   </p>  <p>  So far 7 Programmes from 5 Member States have implemented a FI for the current programme period. In order to include a FI as a measure in a RDP an Ex ante Evaluation is required by EU regulation. This evaluation can take between 3 months to a year to complete. It includes a range of steps and must assess:</p>  <p>  -	Market analysis - need to prove that FIs are required due to investment gap. This gap must be quantified.</p>  <p>  -	Estimation of value added of FI</p>  <p>-	Estimation of public and private resources to be raised   </p>  <p>  -	Reflection on lessons from other instruments </p>  <p>-	Development of a proposed investment strategy (i.e. choice of instrument) and description of the advantages and disadvantages of different types of financial products   </p>  <p>-	Discussion about how results will contribute to RDP objectives   </p>  <p>  -	Revision and updating of the ex-ante assessment in the case of changing market conditions.</p>  <p>  Once this is done, an agreement must be reached between my Department and any other potential stakeholders/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the ex-ante evaluation. Following this, a new measure description would have to be drafted and inserted into the RDP by way of an amendment.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to explore new and more competitive sources of funding for the agri-food sector. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which includes the EIB as one of its funding partners, provides an &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product. This credit is available at favourable terms for investments in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. The features of the SBCI   products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5m and increased repayment flexibility. Since its launch the SBCI has made &euro;750 million of lower-cost loans available for Irish Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), including farmers. In its last report, the SBCI stated that of the loans approved and drawn down by SMEs, a third had been accessed by the agriculture sector.</p></reply>

Officials from the Department have met IUNVA representatives on site to discuss the Association&rsquo;s plans for the Barracks and have raised issues regarding those plans. The premises were initially provided to IUNVA on the basis that it would be used as a meeting place for members of the Association. Since then it has come to our attention that IUNVA&rsquo;s long term vision for the premises include the provision of a coffee shop, overnight accommodation for its members and a bar. A lease is currently being considered in that context.</p>  <p>  Also the Department of Justice and Equality, who are the lead Department for the refugee accommodation programme, are considering whether any of the buildings falling within the remit of my Department, including Columb Barracks, are suitable for the purposes of temporary accommodation for refugees.</p>  <p>  While the Department supports the ongoing use of the Barracks by the local community the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained given that the Barracks is no longer required for military purposes. </p>  <p>  In this regard Officials from the Department are scheduled to meet with the CEO of Westmeath County Council in the coming weeks to discuss possible future plans for the Barracks. They would also be happy to discuss, with any interested group, any proposals they may have for the possible purchase and future development of the site for the benefit of the local community. </p>  <p>This is in keeping with the Department&rsquo;s policy to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.</p></reply>

The new Strategy is being prepared on the basis of wide consultation with interested parties in a 3 Phase consultation process. Phases 1 and 2 involving the identification of key themes and building on those through a broad consultation process to produce high-level objectives for the years 2016-2019 have been completed. Phase 3 will commence shortly and focus on agreeing specific actions and time frames in relation to each objective. In summary, my aim is to ensure a rigorous focus on identifying the key themes that impact on the lives of people with disabilities, on identifying agreed objectives within each theme and on developing specific actions to be undertaken to achieve each of the agreed objectives, together with time frames and key performance indicators so that the new Strategy will make a real difference to the lives of people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  I welcome the positive engagement of all stake holders in the process so far including their participation in the first round of public meetings and in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group and look forward to continuing to work with all interested parties in completing and delivering the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in autumn 2014, I launched the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with Disabilities. The aim of this strategy was to ensure that the barriers faced by those living with a disability in finding employment could be addressed.  I appointed Fergus Finlay as the independent chairperson of the strategy's implementation committee to ensure that the Government is provided with regular updates on the Strategy's progression.</p></reply>

They will be either persons coming from Greece or Italy under the EU Relocation measures or programme refugees coming to Ireland from the Lebanon and Jordan under the UNHCR-led resettlement programme. Persons arriving under the Relocation measures will have their applications for asylum processed in an accelerated procedure of approximately 8-12 weeks. Once refugee status has been granted, these persons will be eligible to enter employment and to access other supports on the same basis as nationals. Persons coming to Ireland under the resettlement programme will have programme refugee status on arrival. Persons accepted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to apply for family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland. </p>  <p>  In 2015, 176 refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict were admitted to Ireland from Jordan and Lebanon under the UNHCR-led resettlement programme. It is planned that an additional 120 refugees will be admitted from Lebanon in early 2016, with the remaining cases admitted on a gradually increasing phased basis thereafter. The first transfer of persons to Ireland under the EU Relocation measures is expected to take place from Greece in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, the report was referred by Government to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  One of the key recommendations in the report which goes to the heart of the length of time people spend in Direct Provision is the early enactment of the International Protection Bill and in that regard, the Government has brought forward as a major priority legislation to provide for the introduction of a single applications procedure for international protection.  This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  This is aimed at addressing one of the key issues identified in the report, that is, the length of time persons remain in the Direct Provision system. The Deputy will be aware that the International Protection Bill was signed into law by the President on 30 December, 2015. Work has since commenced on the implementation of the single procedure which is expected to be introduced in the coming months. The Act provides for the transfer of responsibility for the processing of protection applications from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) to my Department. I will establish an International Protection Office in the Department for this purpose. The Act also provides for the establishment of an independent International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT), which will provide an effective remedy against decisions taken on applications, including a decision to refuse. Existing best practice will be protected and embedded within the new regime. The International Protection Act alone responds to 26 of the recommendations of the Working Group report.</p></reply>

The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of Juvenile Liaison Officers is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of the victims. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families. </p>  <p>  Garda Youth Diversion Projects support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers in particular, in the implementation of the Diversion Programme. The projects primarily seek to divert young people involved in anti-social/criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. The projects may also work with young people who are significantly at risk of becoming involved in anti-social and criminal behaviour. By doing so, the projects contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/Community relationships.  My Department has responsibility for the Community Programmes Unit of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) which manages the Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) network nationwide.</p>  <p>  During 2014 and 2015, the locations of all Garda Youth Diversion Projects were reviewed in the context of the allocation of additional funding under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan. As a result, significant additional support has been allocated to the Garda Youth Diversion Programme in the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Region Northern Division including the establishment of three new GYDPs in Balbriggan, Donnycarney/Fairview/Clontarf and Kilbarrack/Killester/Raheny.  In addition, the existing projects in Ballymun and Coolock were allocated funding to support the recruitment of an additional youth justice worker in each project. Should young people in the area referred to by the Deputy come to the attention of local garda&iacute;, local Garda Management, in conjunction with the National Garda Youth Diversion Office and the Community Programmes Unit of my Department, may work with district GYDP Project Committees to include access to these services, as resources allow.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce earlier this month that seven new Garda Youth Diversion Projects, including the three that I have already mentioned above,  are to commence operations this year.  The other  new projects are located in Athy, Co. Kildare, Naas, Co. Kildare, Nenagh, Co. Tipperary and Rathkeale, Co. Limerick.</p></reply>

The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.

This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.</p>  <p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in-service provision and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of interaction with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. The intention is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected in the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Inclusion Strategy's monitoring process.  I should point out that my Department's role is that of policy coordination and that I have no role in relation to the funding of services or funding of access to services.   The focus is on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of Irish Sign Language with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on the introduction of legislation or its designation as an official language.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the existing supports for use of Irish Sign Language in Ireland give a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is a dualist State, Article 29.6 of the Constitution providing that international agreements have the force of law to the extent determined by the Oireachtas. It is essential therefore that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.    Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 21 October 2015, Minister Fitzgerald and I published a roadmap to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the CRPD, which outlines legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated timeframe involved. We also approved the drafting of an omnibus bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification, the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the General Scheme of which will be published shortly, with enactment by the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap to Ratification is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  It sets out the considerable work currently underway to deal with outstanding barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification, including mental health legislation, the law governing the administration of electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), amendments to the criminal law, and the removal of archaic and offensive references in legislation across Government Departments to persons being &ldquo;of unsound mind&rdquo;.  Other hurdles include the resolution of the constitutional issue concerning reasonable accommodation, and ensuring that the Convention&rsquo;s requirements are met in relation to deprivation of liberty.  These, along with any outstanding miscellaneous legislative amendments, will be resolved in the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></reply>

In December 2015, having considered the licence fee structure for individual licences, the PSA replaced the previous 2 year individual licence with a new 3 year licence. This new licence was introduced following a review of licensing charges with a view to reducing the overall cost of licensing for employees. As a result of this change the annual cost of a licence has been reduced for all such licence holders by an average of 25%.</p>  <p>  The Authority had advised me that the new 3 year licence for a Security Guard costs &euro;90 while a licence for a Door Supervisor or individual working in the Cash-in-Transit  sector costs &euro;150.

It is understood from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed and there are no plans at present for further station closures in 2015 and 2016.  The primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. </p>  <p>  While crime trends continue to be monitored closely by local Garda management, I am advised that the available data does not point to a correlation between the closure of Garda stations and increased crime rates.</p></reply>

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support front-line Garda&iacute; and intelligence-led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined through consultation between the Commissioner and the Policing Authority and with the consent of the Minister in accordance with section 20 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Community Policing is the underpinning philosophy and ethos through which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to deliver a service to the community.  In this regard the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that, following the launch of the National Model of Community Policing in 2009, a significant number of Garda clinics have been established.  A Garda clinic is a small public Garda facility that provides basic Garda services within the community and which augments the District Garda Stations. Garda clinics are an established good community policing practice and are designed to place the needs of our communities at the centre of Garda services by improving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ability to identify and anticipate community needs through pro-active engagement and effective service provision.  Garda Clinics are delivered in partnership with the community and are established and conducted, where practicable, at community orientated venues. </p>  <p>  I am also advised that Garda clinics, in addition to focusing on topics such as neighbourhood watch, crime prevention and advice to the older persons, also support the delivery of various Garda services e.g. passport applications, driving license production, age card applications and crime prevention advice.  I am informed that these clinics are generally open for 1-2 hours but their frequency and venue would be consistent. </p>  <p>  Types of Garda Clinics include:</p>  <p>  -  Campus Clinic provides a Garda service aimed at Staff &amp;amp; Students at post leaving cert and third level institutes.</p>  <p>  -  A Business Watch/Retail Clinic is provides a Garda service aimed at the business sector and are generally housed in shopping centres and similar retail outlets.</p>  <p>  -  A Garda Community Policing Clinic is a Garda clinic offering a basic Garda service to the community.</p>  <p>  -  A Multi Agency Clinic is a clinic consisting of Garda members and other state and NGO agencies such as HSE, Social welfare, etc and are a place where these wide range of services can be obtained to the general public.</p>  <p>  -  Themed Clinics are Garda clinics set up for the duration of a special community event be it of a sporting or social nature so a Garda service can be delivered away from a Garda Station and delivered directing within the venue or area of the event.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are fully committed to continued proactive engagement with communities in addressing crime prevention and community safety issues.  The arrangements and measures in place to achieve this objective are subject to ongoing review and analysis to ensure the continued delivery of an effective policing service.</p></reply>

Ireland has agreed to accept approximately 4,000 persons in total under resettlement and relocation programmes by the end of 2017.  The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 persons to be taken in from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece under the new EU programme and 520 programme refugees from Lebanon and Jordan, which the Irish Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland's Refugee Resettlement programme.  The mechanism by which the balance of the 4,000 will be taken in, has yet to be decided by Government.</p>  <p>  Among the measures agreed under the programme was the establishment of a network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres which will be used to provide emergency accommodation and meet the basic needs of the 4,000 people who are expected to arrive over the next two years.  Also among the measures announced was the establishment of a cross-Departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to coordinate and implement the logistical and operational aspects associated with the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  This will include the provision of emergency accommodation and orientation services in the first instance, and facilitating the longer term integration needs of those with refugee status through the provision of a sustainable housing strategy, health services, education, social welfare, and social inclusion activities.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to refugees arriving under resettlement schemes, one hundred and seventy six refugees arrived in the State under the resettlement programme in 2015.  Post arrival, the 'programme' refugees participate in a language training and orientation programme for approximately 8-10 weeks before being moved into permanent accommodation in the community.  The resettlement team of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration convenes and supports a local interagency working group which operates for approximately 18 months after the transfer of the refugees to the receiving community.  Grants are made to the receiving community for the establishment of homework clubs, links with sporting and other clubs and the employment of a local resettlement person to support the refugees during their first year in the community.</p>  <p>  A similar integration strategy is being developed within the Department of Justice and Equality for the estimated 2,600 persons relocating to Ireland from migration hotspots in Italy and Greece, once they receive refugee status.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2010, protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.</p><p>Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  </p><p>As of the 8 January, the HPRA has received 961 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 961 reports received, 958 were associated with use of Gardasil and three were associated with Cervarix.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  </p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  </p><p>All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. </p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website () where further information is available.  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p><p>Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.  </p><p>In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  </p><p>The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

We have provided &euro;160 million ring-fenced funding and approved 1,150 new posts for mental health since 2012 up to the end of 2016, to modernise services in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i>and Programme for Government commitments.  This includes &euro;35 million provided for 2016, bringing the total budget available for the mental health this year to &euro;826.6 million.  A key focus has been additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children.  This funding is also being used to enhance specialist community mental health and forensic services, increase the access to counselling and psychotherapy and for suicide prevention initiatives. </p><p>In 2016, our priorities will include the continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health Teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically, ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.</p><p>The HSE in is National Service Plan for 2016 has also committed to:</p><p>- Ensuring that the views of service users, family members and carers are central to the design and delivery of mental health services;</p><p>- Designing integrated evidence based and recovery focused mental health services;</p><p>- Delivering timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements;</p><p>- Promoting the mental health of the population in collaboration with other services and agencies including reducing loss of life by suicide; and</p><p>- Enabling the provision of mental health services by highly trained and engaged staff and fit for purpose infrastructure.</p><p>Plans for the Mental Health Service also include the development of a new National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) hospital, which will be built on the site of St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  Work on improving the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Services will continue, thus ensuring that all aspects of the service are delivered in a consistent and timely fashion, including improved access.  The HSE recently introduced a new <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b>for both in-patient and community CAMHS services.  This will help improve the service overall, such as reducing inappropriate admissions of adolescents to adult units, and reducing Waiting Lists, particularly for those waiting over 12 months.  Those waiting 12 months or more has decreased by 55% from 459 at end of April 2015 to 207 in November 2015.  </p><p>Other priorities include the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to reflect the changes recommended by the Expert Group review of the Mental Health Act 2001, the review of <i>A Vision for Change </i>which will be 10 years old this year, and the implementation of <i>Connecting for Life</i>- Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015 - 2020. </p></reply>

The title of physiotherapist will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act.  In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views. The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter shortly that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-01-19a.912.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016011900072#WRU02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 377 and 378 together.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.</p><p>At the start of the HSE&rsquo;s schools immunisation programme in 2010 the HPRA requested reporting of all suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with use of Gardasil and since that time 958 reports have been submitted to the HPRA.  A breakdown of reports per year is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of reports of suspected adverse reactions/events submitted to the HPRA in association with Gardasil</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>255</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>142</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to 08/01/2016)</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p><p>The vast majority of reports received have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects associated with use of Gardasil, as described in the product information.  These include vaccination related events occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as: </p><p>-  syncope (faints) which have been among the most commonly reported effects. Other commonly reported symptoms include malaise, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness and injection site reactions;</p><p>-  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes.</p><p>Other reports include experiences of persisting/chronic fatigue or persistent joint/muscle/nerve pain, in some cases with multiple other symptoms (e.g. headache, malaise, drowsiness, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, joint swelling, nausea, flu like illness, menstrual disorders etc.) following vaccination.  Some reports have indicated that a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) has been made, while in others, follow up and investigations are on-going. </p><p>All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA were transmitted to the EMA's Eudravigilance database and were considered as part of the ongoing EU review.  The first and second stage of this review concluded in late 2015 and the EMA recommended that it did not consider there was any need to change the way the HPV vaccines are used or to amend the current product information. The review recognised that more than 80 million girls and women worldwide have now received these vaccines and in some European countries they have been given to 90% of the age group recommended for vaccination.  The matter is now with the European Commission for a final and binding decision. Use of these vaccines is expected to prevent many cases of cervical cancer (cancer of the neck of the womb, which is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in Europe each year) and various other cancers and conditions caused by HPV. The benefits of HPV vaccines therefore continue to outweigh their risks.</p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  </p><p>All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet. The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. </p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter. Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally. The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination. Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. </p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website () where further information is available. The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices. The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information. These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.</p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  The amount payable in respect of certain of these supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contracted GPs, also based on the size of each doctor's GMS patient panel. The HSE pays into a superannuation scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to contracted GPs.</p>  <p>  The most recently published Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments of the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service relates to the year 2013.  This   report indicates that payments totalling &euro;451.7 million were made to some 2,400 GMS contract holders.  In total these costs related to approximately 1.9 million GMS patients.  There was substantial variation in the average amount paid, ranging from &euro;14,753 for a patient panel of up to 100 patients to &euro;448,960 for a panel of 2,001 or more patients.  The addition of substantially more contract-holding GPs would enhance the choice available to patients in the first place but any impact on the Exchequer would be dependent on the distribution of the eligible patients across the panels of contracting doctors.  Where newly-qualified GPs obtain a GMS contract, they can only attract patients from the existing pool of GMS patients until such time as further phases of universal GP care are introduced.</p></reply>

The subjects of these orders are given no indication of the allegations or concerns for which they are being detained.  This person has been on hunger strike, reportedly taking only water, since 25 November, in protest both at his detention without charge and what he states was his questioning under duress.   Ireland has consistently made clear our view that administrative detention, which if it exists at all should only be an exceptional emergency measure, is being used far more widely against Palestinian activists.  If there are genuine security concerns about individuals, they should be charged and tried under the law.</p>  <p>  Ireland has conveyed these views to the Israeli authorities both directly and through our interventions at UN level and, at the urging of Ireland and others, in EU Council Conclusions.  We will continue to do so. Our Missions in the area are monitoring this case and have raised it at EU level.</p>  <p>  I must however also urge this prisoner to end his hunger strike, which has reached the point where his health is in serious danger.  There has been a series of hunger strikes in recent years in relation to administrative detention, although in all cases the prison authorities have achieved a successful resolution.  I am deeply concerned however that, however much one might appreciate the frustration of persons detained without trial, such strikes, if repeated, may eventually end in a tragic outcome.  I call on all sides to ensure this does not occur.</p></reply>

The aim of the scheme is to address educational disadvantage and to develop and disseminate innovative education models.  TA21 was established in 2014 with support from Google Ireland.  The scheme mainly focuses on students in second level schools that are targeted by the social inclusion measures of the Department through the DEIS Programme.   The objective of CFES is to increase student's college and career aspirations through participation in three core practices which are: mentoring; leadership through service; and pathways to college.  The CFES model that has been adapted from the USA to the Irish context and is based on a strong evidence base in the US showing a 90% college progression rate for participating students.</p>  <p>  One of the objectives of the new National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 is that the HEA support the dissemination of best practice in the provision of mentoring programmes for students in second level.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p><p>Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p><p>These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p><p>Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement.  Improved pay scales for post</p><p>- 1 January 2011 and post</p><p>- 1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  In addition, allowances payable to post</p><p>- 1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post</p><p>- 1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p><p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.  Circular letter 0066/2015 which issued in December 2015 sets out the revisions to the thresholds for the Pension Related Deduction from 2015 and revised salary scales for teachers which take effect from 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated to ensure that pupils with special educational needs can participate fully in education.  Some &euro;1.37 billion, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget, will be spent this year to ensure that such children can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.   A range of supports and services are provided to schools, to enable individuals to achieve their full potential, including additional learning and resource teaching support,  Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment, services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), enhanced levels of capitation in Special schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.</p>  <p>  As Special Heroes Ireland is not a recognised school as defined by the 1998 Education Act it does not, therefore, qualify for State funding directly from my Department.  The Department of Education and Skills has no responsibility or mandate for providing support directly to the organisation.  As the Deputy will be aware all Departments must adhere to current legislation and public financial management policies set out for each Department.</p></reply>

In such cases these children will receive additional teaching support through the learning support and/or the resource teacher and, where appropriate, will receive access to Special Needs Assistance and assistive technology if required.</p>  <p>  In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level, of which 762 are for children with Autism.  Each special class for autism has a 6:1 pupil teacher ratio at primary level, and 6:1.5 at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in various geographical areas as required and where an identified need for such classes exists.  In this regard, where schools indicate that they will open a special class, the SENO will sanction the establishment of this class.  However, the NCSE will only allocate staffing resources once pupils are enrolled in the class, in accordance with my Department's policy.</p>  <p>  SENOs will be engaging with schools for 2016/17 school year in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes, in order to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand in an area.  A full list of special classes is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has recently submitted their Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE has consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.

The Strategy provides a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme.  In line with the prioritisation of funding for social housing, the overall Exchequer provision for Housing has increased by almost &euro;145 million in 2016, so that the combined capital and current housing allocation is almost &euro;821 million across a range of housing programmes.  In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services from their own resources to the value of over &euro;112 million, bringing the total Housing provision in 2016 to &euro;933 million.  This year will also see continued expansion in social housing provision under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>, with over 17,000 new homes to be delivered this year under a range of social housing initiatives.</p><p>Targets and provisional funding allocations for delivery under my Department&rsquo;s main capital and current programmes were issued to all local authorities, including Wexford County Council, in April 2015.  The targets are for the period out to 2017 and the available funding is being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by the local authorities designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.  Wexford County has a target of 677 units, supported by &euro;25.4m of investment, broken down as follows: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Local Authority Housing/ <br /><br />AHB delivery via Capital Assistant Scheme / <br /><br />Return of vacant properties</th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme </th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>Period </td><td>2015-17 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td></tr><tr><td>Social Housing Units </td><td>114 </td><td>89 </td><td>251 </td><td>110 </td><td>113 </td></tr></table></p><p>The detailed implementation of the programmes and projects to deliver on these targets is a matter for each individual local authority, but I am confident that good progress is being made in their achievement.  To date I have announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, including 54 new units for Wexford at a cost estimate of &euro;7.3 million, and I will be making further announcements shortly.  Details of the projects I have already announced are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: </p><p>Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant social housing units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, have been important parts of social housing delivery to date.  I was determined that local authorities would have the opportunity to maximise the number of vacant units brought back into productive use and so, in 2015, I funded the remediation of some 2,700 units nationally.</p><p>I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms available to them, local authorities will continue to deliver new social housing across all programmes in 2016.</p></reply>

The Minister for Finance also pays an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax that was collected in the particular year, from the Central Fund to the Local Government Fund.  Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced in 2013 to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for local authorities, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions. Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government decided that no local authority would receive less allocation from LPT in 2015 than they received from General Purpose Grants in 2014.  Under the process known as equalisation, 80% of LPT is retained locally and the remaining 20% is re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authority areas that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State. Ultimately, all LPT proceeds are re-distributed to local authorities.</p><p>Based on its shortfall position when expected 2015 LPT receipts are compared to GPG Allocations 2014, Galway County Council and Mayo County Council were in receipt of equalisation funding in 2015. The table below shows the 2015 LPT allocations for Galway City, Galway County and Mayo County Councils. <table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2015 LPT Retained Locally </div></th><th><div>Equalisation Funding </div></th><th><div>Total LPT Funding Provided in 2015 </div></th></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td><div>6,709,100 <br /><br />  </div></td><td><div>Nil <br /><br />  </div></td><td><div>6,709,100 <br /><br />  </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td><div>11,973,614 </div></td><td><div>532,767 </div></td><td><div>12,506,381 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td><div>8,568,212 <br /><br />  </div></td><td><div>8,924,382 <br /><br />  </div></td><td><div>17,171,286 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>Apart from its role as a vehicle for distributing LPT proceeds, the other income accruing to the Local Government Fund, including the proceeds of Motor Tax, is used for a range of purposes, including to provide funding to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for onwards allocation in support of local authority roads and public transport infrastructure, and for supports for miscellaneous local authority related schemes such as rural group water schemes and shared services initiatives. </p><p>Gross motor tax receipts (including online receipts) for Galway City and County and Mayo in 2014 and 2015 were as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2014 &euro; </div></th><th><div>2015 &euro; </div></th></tr><tr><td>Galway City and County </td><td><div>64,009,463 </div></td><td><div>62,680,012 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>34,570,463 </div></td><td><div>33,242,996 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>The overall allocation from my Department from the Local Government Fund to Galway City, Galway County and Mayo in 2014 and 2015 is set out in the table below.<table><tr><th>-</th><th><div>2014 &euro; </div></th><th><div>2015 &euro; </div></th></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td><div>2,589,084.24 </div></td><td><div>7,573,665.42 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td><div>18,729,482.37 </div></td><td><div>17,404,360.77 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td><div>23,150,022.74 </div></td><td><div>22,403,976.12 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>As the Local Government Fund also provides funding to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the local authorities concerned will have received further funding from that Department for the support of local authority roads and public transport infrastructure in 2014 and 2015, details of which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

Provision is made in the Electoral Act 1992 for persons to be deemed to be ordinarily resident if they intend to resume residence within eighteen months after giving it up. I have no current plans to amend this provision generally; however it may be subject to consideration in the analysis that I am undertaking of the issues that would arise in the extension of the franchise at Presidential elections to citizens resident outside the State.  The Convention on the Constitution recommended in its Fifth Report that the Constitution be amended to give citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections. In considering a response to this recommendation the Government <i>decided that it would be necessary to analyse the full range of issues</i><i><font color="#FF0000"> </font></i><i>that would arise in any significant extension of the franchise, before any decision could be made on the holding of a referendum. </i>The Government acknowledges that such an extension of the franchise might be welcomed by many in the diaspora. However, it would be challenging to introduce and to manage and a range of issues arise for analysis in that context, including policy, legal and practical issues.  <i>I am undertaking the necessary analysis in co-operation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Diaspora Affairs.</i></p><p>There is no provision in electoral law to allow for pre-ballot day voting other than in the context of postal voting or voting on islands. Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person who are entered in the register of electors - whole-time members of the Defence Forces; members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses or civil partners; electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability; electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State; certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside; and electors who because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote. </p><p>While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to introduce pre-ballot day voting or to extend existing arrangements for postal voting. In responding to the recommendation of the Convention on the Constitution in their fourth report, that there should be greater access to postal voting, the Government proposed that an Electoral Commission be tasked in due course with considering the issue and advising in detail on the electoral and operational implications, including costs, of implementing change in this area. </p></reply>

The Council reported 5% as the percentage of overall offers refused during the 12 month period to 30 September 2015. One of the key reasons identified for the low level of refusals in South Dublin County Council is the use of a Choice Based Letting (CBL) allocation system to allow social housing applicants to choose properties themselves from those available from the Council&rsquo;s stock. </p>  <p>  In order to address the refusals issue on a sectoral basis, I requested that every local authority immediately consider the introduction of a CBL allocation system.

However there is currently a civil remedy available concerning branches or roots of neighbouring trees encroaching on a person&rsquo;s property. The previous Minister of State for Housing and Planning wrote to the Minister for Justice in June 2012 to explore the possibility of providing a broader civil law remedy for parties affected by high trees and hedges on adjoining properties. In this regard, advice was sought on the possibility of legislative provision being made whereby a person substantially deprived of the enjoyment of their property, such as the deprivation of light caused by high trees on a neighbouring property, could apply to the Courts for an order, and that the Courts could make an order as they see fit, e.g. to cut the trees back to an appropriate height. The Minister for Justice responded in July 2012 suggesting that disputes of this nature between neighbours could perhaps be more appropriately dealt with through mediation &ndash; which is being increasingly used internationally as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes - rather than through the Courts. In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Justice is giving consideration to a Mediation Bill which would assist in <i>speeding up the resolution of civil disputes of this nature, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings.</i></p></reply>

The tax relief is available where the property is let to an individual in receipt of rent supplement or housing assistance payment, or leased to a local authority for social housing.  In order to avail of this relief, it is necessary for the landlord to submit an undertaking to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) that they will let the premises under a qualifying lease for a continuous period of three years in the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019.   The tax relief is also available to landlords for existing qualifying tenants already in place at 31 December 2015. In such cases, the undertaking to the PRTB must be made by 31 March 2016.  In the case of new leases commencing on or after 1 January 2016, the undertaking must be made at the time the landlord is required to apply to register the tenancy with the Private Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  Security of tenure under the Residential Tenancies Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.   Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period. This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy. </p>  <p>  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act. A Part 4 tenancy may only be terminated on specific grounds set out in section 34 of the Act including where, for example, the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations of the tenancy or the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 3 months .   </p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act. Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, or where the tenant does not comply with the notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board for resolution.</p></reply>

Under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has statutory responsibility for the maintenance of rivers on which it has executed works since the 1945 Act. These arterial drainage schemes had as their primary purpose the improvement of drainage on agricultural lands. This typically involved lowering or widening river beds to facilitate the drainage and discharge of neighbouring lands and drainage channels. While new arterial drainage schemes are no longer being undertaken, the OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition. The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.   </p>  <p>  Additionally, Drainage Districts are areas where drainage schemes to improve land for agricultural purposes were constructed under the Arterial Drainage Acts from 1842 up to 1943. When a subsequent scheme covered the same ground as one of the earlier schemes, the previous Drainage District was abolished. Of the 293 schemes carried out, 170 remain and the statutory duty of maintenance for these schemes rests with the relevant Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland, a North/South Implementation Body, manages, maintains, develops and promotes over 1000km of inland navigable waterways principally for recreational purposes. The waterways under the remit of the body are the Barrow Navigation, the Erne System, the Grand Canal, the Lower Bann, the Royal Canal, the Shannon-Erne Waterway and the Shannon Navigation.   </p>  <p>  The OPW is the responsible authority for coordinating the development and implementation of policy on the management of flood risk in Ireland. The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme is its core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding. The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding and this is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. Implementation of this Directive is being coordinated with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive   </p>  <p>  Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address, and they may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources. The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.   </p>  <p>  From a water quality perspective, the key EU directive is the EU Water Framework Directive which requires all member states to protect and improve water quality in all waters so that good ecological status is achieved by 2015 or, at the latest, by 2027. This objective is to be supported through implementation of successive river basin management plans (RBMPs). The RBMPs describe the measures planned to protect and improve Ireland&rsquo;s water environment covering rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional (estuaries) and coastal waters. The first plans were completed in 2010 covering the period to 2015; the second planning cycle for the period 2015-2021 is now underway but will not be completed until end-2017. </p>  <p>  In June 2015, I published a consultation document on Significant Water Management Issues in Ireland.

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available.</p><p>On the 22 December 2015, I formally launched the procurement process for the State Intervention to provide high quality, high speed broadband to all premises in Ireland that may not be served through commercial investment. The formal procurement commenced with the publication of the Project Information Memorandum and the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. In addition, my Department also published: </p><p>- the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and</p><p>- the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. </p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.</p><p>The 2020 map is available at . The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016. The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention. Members of the public can see whether their individual premise is in the BLUE or AMBER area by inserting their Eircode, and/ or address, or scrolling through the map. </p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, and the current high speed broadband map, 97% of the townland of Belmullet will be covered by the commercial sector this year, while the remaining 3% of the townland will be part of the State intervention. </p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. </p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018, with all addresses passed by 2020.</p><p>More generally, I am informed by the commercial operators that next generation broadband services have been rolled out to over almost 18,000 premises to date in County Mayo with over 15,500 more expected to be serviced by commercial investment. Almost 51,000 remaining premises in County Mayo will be covered either by further commercial investment or the proposed State intervention.</p></reply>

The mapping exercise was undertaken by officials within my own Department and its advisors and involved extensive discussion with industry.  The stages involved in the mapping exercise comprised: - An information request to all authorised undertakings in July 2013 - A Call for Inputs in June 2014 to assist in the development of the assessment criteria</p><p>- Publication of High Speed Broadband Map in November 2014 &ndash; further public consultation</p><p>- A supplementary information request issued to industry in April 2015</p><p>- Consultation on managing the map &ndash; October 2015</p><p>- Publication of High Speed Broadband Map 2020 in December 2015.</p><p>All information gleaned from the various stages of this process was required to be validated before being transferred to an interactive map and colour coded BLUE and AMBER. The BLUE area indicates that commercial servcices will be provided by the end of 2016. Premises in the AMBER area will be included in the State intervention. This process culminated in the production of the High Speed Broadband map 2016 initially and subsequently the High Speed Broadband Map 2020.</p><p>The 2020 map which is available at allows all member of the public, be they business or residential , to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services or whether they will be included in the Government&rsquo;s intervention. Citizens can search for their individual premises using their Eircode, or address, or by scrolling through the map, and see whether that premises will be covered by commercial investment or the State intervention. Every townland in Ireland has been mapped, and information on the number of premises in each townland and the percentage that are in commerical (BLUE) and non-commercial (AMBER) areas are provided.</p><p>The Map is a critical aspect of European State Aid compliance and the mapping process remains open, in accordance with terms that have been published on my Department's website <i></i>so that any new developments can be managed. </p><p>I do not have precise figures for all elements of the mapping exercise as it impacts on all aspects of the intervention strategy and is integrated with several work streams. I can confirm however that the in-house ICT related cost to the Department to date of producing the map is in the region of &euro; 203,000 including VAT.</p></reply>

Under the Agreement it is envisaged that construction of Phase 1 of the A5 will start in 2017 with a view to completion in 2019.

Pedal-powered rickshaws come within the definition of 'pedal cycles' and powered rickshaws are classified as 'mechanically propelled vehicles'.  They, like all other road traffic, are obliged to obey road traffic law.  The measures which I introduced recently to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to issue fixed charge notices to cyclists also apply to pedal powered rickshaws and will provide and important tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing the law. <br /><br />  At present there is no legislation in place to regulate the carriage of passengers by rickshaws. Rickshaws by their nature operate at a local level.  Local authorities regulate many activities at local level through bye-laws made under local government regulation.  In response to concerns (primarily of a health and safety nature), and following a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, Dublin City Council (DCC), has prepared draft bye-laws under the Local Government Act 2001 to regulate the operation of rickshaws.<br /><br />  As I set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1186 of 3rd November 2015, it is my understanding that DCC, subject to receipt of certain legal clarifications, intend to bring the draft bye-laws, which would provide for a licensing regime for rickshaws, before the Strategic Policy Committee of the Council for its consideration.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The programme is an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.</p><p>Officials from my Department have facilitated an intensive consultation period during 2015, including active engagement with schools, universities, colleges, business and voluntary organisations, arts and culture institutions, historical societies, local authorities and representative groups &ndash; at home and in our Diaspora around the world &ndash; to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about 2016, and to foster programme initiatives.  Work has been ongoing to implement a comprehensive programme and planning is well underway for the range of initiatives within the seven programme strands.  </p><p>Among the key milestones achieved to date are the following:</p><p>- A programme of State ceremonial events, which represent the formal and solemn marking of 1916 by the citizens of Ireland as the seminal event that led to our independence, has been initiated.  The first of these State ceremonial events took place on 1<sup>st</sup>January with a flag raising ceremony at Dublin Castle, which was attended by President Michael D. Higgins and An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D.  This solemn commemoration was followed by the Ireland 2016 Peace Proms, which took place in partnership with the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland and choirs representing all parts of the country.  A significant number of State ceremonies are due to take place throughout 2016, particularly around Easter time, and plans for each of these events are progressing well.  </p><p>- Over 84 public consultation meetings were held with local communities all around the country, with 31 individual county plans launched on 8<sup>th</sup>October 2015, comprising over 1,800 events nationwide.  &euro;1m was allocated to facilitate these plans last year, with a further &euro;3m to be made available this year.</p><p>- An allocation of &euro;22 million in capital funding was provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015 for the &lsquo;Permanent Reminder&rsquo; projects, with a further &euro;31m being allocated this year. These capital projects are progressing well.</p><p>- The Global and Diaspora Programme was launched on 29<sup>th</sup>June 2015 and was very positively received at home and abroad.</p><p>- On 6<sup>th</sup>August 2015, the Arts Council announced 9 major arts projects to commemorate 1916.  </p><p>- The National Flag Initiative was launched on 14<sup>th</sup>September 2015, marking the commencement of the delivery by the Defence Forces of our National Flag and the Proclamation to over 3,300 national schools across the country.  Some 3,000 flags have now been delivered and the project has been very well received by the schools and children involved.  </p><p>- The Irish Language strand - <i>An Teanga Bheo</i>- was launched at the end of October 2015 by An Taoiseach. </p><p>- The Education Programme strand was launched on 22<sup>nd</sup>September 2015 for the primary, post-primary and third-level education sectors.</p><p>- Consultation is ongoing with relevant stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including official, political, media, artistic and NGO stakeholders.</p><p>- The National Cultural Institutions are advancing a range of innovative exhibitions and projects.</p><p>- The official Culture Ireland programme <i>&ldquo;I am Ireland&rdquo;</i>was launched by Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on 3<sup>rd</sup>October 2015. This will showcase the best of Irish arts and culture on the international stage.</p><p>- On 10<sup>th</sup>November 2015, I announced that work was to start on the conservation and restoration of the National Monument in Moore Street, acquired by the State earlier in the year, which will facilitate its development as a new Commemorative Centre for the public.</p><p>- On 14 January, together with my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, I chaired a workshop to explore the development of new proposals to ensure that 2016 will produce a legacy of gender inclusion befitting a republic founded on the values of equal citizenship.  The workshop was attended by representatives of a broad cross section of society, including members of the arts, business and sports communities, media professionals and the charity and social care sectors.</p><p>Further information in relation to the various events, activities and initiatives taking place under each of 7 strands of the Programme, including the 31 county plans launched in October 2015, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s dedicated website at <font color="#0000FF">.</font></p></reply>

This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission.   A long-term compensation scheme has been introduced to compensate turf cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p>  <p>  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. It is expected that this Plan will be finalised over the coming period.</p>  <p>  Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p></reply>

In 1988, the then Irish Land Commission nominally transferred management of shooting rights to the Wildlife Service, which is now the National Parks and Wildlife Service, a constituent part of my Department.  I am not aware of any specific grievances within rural communities in the context of state-owned shooting rights, but I would certainly ask my Department to examine any such grievances brought to my attention.</p></reply>
