The Programme was eligible for co-funding of 40% to 50% under the European Regional Development Fund. Phase I of the MANs programme delivered optical fibre based networks to twenty eight towns and cities around the country. The total capital cost of Phase I of the Programme was &euro;85 million. Phase II of the MANs programme delivered a further sixty fibre networks serving sixty-six towns. The total capital cost of Phase II of the Programme is &euro;91.5 million.  The MANs are managed, maintained and operated by e|net, who were appointed as Concessionaire following a procurement process in 2004 for the Phase I MANs and in 2009 for the Phase II MANs. e|net makes the networks available to the telecommunications sector on an open access basis. </p><p>  Of the 88 MANs, 83 are currently &ldquo;lit&rdquo;, that is, connected to backhaul and in use by one or more licensed telecoms service providers. The final Phase II MAN, Kinsale, will shortly be handed over to e|net. The MANs that are not currently lit are available and ready to meet demand for services as it arises.  e|net is a commercial organisation and information on traffic on the MANs is commercially sensitive. However, it is estimated that in excess of 600,000 individuals and business users are currently benefitting from the MANs infrastructure. The number of connections to the MANs has doubled in recent years and over 50 service providers are using the MANs infrastructure.</p><p>  Since the inception of the MANs Programme, demand for bandwidth has increased significantly and this increase is expected to continue. Almost all broadband service providers are increasingly turning to optical fibre to backbone their networks. Service providers will continue to bring optical fibre closer to their end users. The MANs are ready to meet the demand for fibre connectivity and are well placed to serve the needs of service providers and their end users for the foreseeable future.  I propose to attach for the Official Report a table setting out a list of the MANs, the construction completion date for each MAN and the current status of each MAN.</p><p><b>Phase One Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)</b><table><tr><th></th><th><b>MAN</b></th><th><b>County</b></th><th><b>Year of Completion</b></th><th><b>Year MAN was lit</b></th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cavan</td><td>Cavan</td><td>2006</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Kingscourt</td><td>Cavan</td><td>2006</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Cork</td><td>Cork</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Carlow</td><td>Carlow</td><td>2005</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Letterkenny</td><td>Donegal</td><td>2004</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Gweedore</td><td>Donegal</td><td>2005</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Galway</td><td>Galway</td><td>2004</td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>2005</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Portlaoise</td><td>Laois</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Carrick on Shannon</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Manorhamilton</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>2005</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Limerick</td><td>Limerick</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Dundalk</td><td>Louth</td><td>2006</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Drogheda</td><td>Louth</td><td>2006</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Ballina</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2003</td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Belmullet</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2011</td><td><b>Not yet lit</b></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Kiltimagh</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2003</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Carrickmacross</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>2006</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>2006</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Tullamore</td><td>Offaly</td><td>2005</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>2004</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Sligo</td><td>Sligo</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Clonmel</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>2004</td><td>2004</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Dungarvan</td><td>Waterford</td><td>2004</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Waterford</td><td>Waterford</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Athlone</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>2004</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Mullingar</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>2005</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Wexford</td><td>Wexford</td><td>2005</td><td>2005</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100052#WRA00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 16 together.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Donegal. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services and is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

While the call for tenders for the appointment of the appropriate expertise to carry out the research programme has been completed, the appraisal of the tenders received is still underway and appropriate experts have yet to be appointed. It is, therefore, difficult to be definitive at this juncture with regard to final costs.</p><p>  It should be noted that the scope of this study is considerable with its key objectives being to ascertain if Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction projects and operations can be carried out on the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health and what is best environmental practice in relation to Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction projects andoperations.  In order to conclude on these matters, the appointed experts will consider baseline characterisation with respect to groundwater, air and seismicity, together with potential environmental impacts and mitigations of hydraulic fracturing, along with a consideration of best international regulatory practice. It is expected that the total cost of the research programme will be in the order of &euro;1m.</p></reply>

In carrying out salmon stock assessments the Committee draws on a number of data sets including rod and commercial catch data, fish counters and catchment wide electro-fishing.  Salmon stocks are assessed in the majority of rivers using salmon rod catch data. These data are used in conjunction with an angler exploitation rate to assess the total salmon stock. This assessment is then correlated with the salmon Conservation Limit which is the number of adult fish required to spawn and sustain a healthy population for each river. Any commercial salmon catch is also included in this calculation. </p><p>  Fish counters are a component element of the assessment array in use by the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon and are particularly useful in cases where rod or commercial data is not available. Of the rivers assessed for the 2014 season, fish counters were used on 31 to assess the upstream salmon run against the conservation limit and facilitate the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon in formulating its advice for those particular rivers.  I am advised that, given the availability of catch records on the majority of rivers, and other indices the number of fish counters in use is considered sufficient as a component within the array of methodologies available to the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon. However the requirement for additional counters is continually reviewed, as it is recognised by all that counters provide additional granularity on the status of salmon stocks. </p><p>  I propose to circulate with the Official Report a table listing the location of the counters.  For other rivers, catchment wide electro-fishing is used to determine the abundance of juvenile salmon in a catchment as an indicator of adult salmon presence.</p><p><i>Location of Counters</i><table><tr><th></th><th>River</th><th>Fishery District</th><th></th><th>16</th><th>Cashla</th><th>Connemara</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dee</td><td>Dundalk</td><td></td><td>17</td><td>Ballynahinch</td><td>Connemara</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Fane</td><td>Dundalk</td><td></td><td>18</td><td>Owenglin</td><td>Ballinakill</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Boyne</td><td>Drogheda</td><td></td><td>19</td><td>Dawros</td><td>Ballinakill</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Liffey </td><td>Dublin</td><td></td><td>20</td><td>Culfin</td><td>Ballinakill</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Slaney</td><td>Wexford</td><td></td><td>21</td><td>Erriff</td><td>Ballinakill</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Bandon</td><td>Cork</td><td></td><td>22</td><td>Bunowen</td><td>Ballinakill</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Kerry Blackwater</td><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td>23</td><td>Burrishoole</td><td>Bangor</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Waterville</td><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td>24</td><td>Owenduff</td><td>Bangor</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Maine</td><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td>25</td><td>Munhin </td><td>Bangor</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Feale</td><td>Limerick</td><td></td><td>26</td><td>Owenmore</td><td>Bangor</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Mulkear</td><td>Limerick</td><td></td><td>27</td><td>Ballisodare</td><td>Sligo</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Shannon</td><td>Limerick</td><td></td><td>28</td><td>Erne</td><td>Ballyshannon</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Dunkellin</td><td>Galway</td><td></td><td>29</td><td>Eany</td><td>Ballyshannon</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Corrib</td><td>Galway</td><td></td><td>30</td><td>Eske</td><td>Ballyshannon</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Boluisce</td><td>Galway</td><td></td><td>31</td><td>Clady</td><td>Letterkenny</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Since its establishment IFI has developed innovative technologies and working methods to create cost efficiencies with no loss of operational efficiency in delivering it services.  IFI&rsquo;s broad range of functions and responsibilities are set out the section 7 of Inland Fisheries Act 2010. In summary these functions relate to the protection, conservation, management and promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fish resources and of sea angling. In accordance with Section 7 of the 2010 Act IFI has specific functions in relation to research and to environmental matters set out in EU and domestic legislation, particularly the Habitats Directive. </p><p>  Section 7(2) (a) of the 2010 Act specifically charges IFI with advising the Minister on conservation, protection, management, marketing development and improvement of inland fisheries, including sea angling. In relation to salmon, IFI is supported by the independent Standing Scientific Committee, established in accordance with the 2010 Act, comprised of scientists from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Loughs Agency, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and other State Agencies.  In its role as the Department&rsquo;s statutory scientific advisors as regards the inland fisheries resource, all advice is supported by fact-based scientific and technical research conducted by the Agency.</p><p>  Given the challenging work-load and circumstances following the establishment of IFI, the amalgamation of 17 bodies into a single national organisation and the continued delivery of excellent services country-wide from a new agency has been a great success.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation porfolio.</p><p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Figures for 2013 show that 19% of electricity demand was met from renewables.To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2013, 17% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, around 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.</p><p>  The issue of carbon penalties potentially arises with regard to Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target. Currently Ireland is in line with our forecast trajectory to meet this target. My Department closely monitors progress in this regard.  We are now looking towards a new EU energy and climate change framework for 2030, and to acheiving a low carbon economy by 2050. Following the recent publication by the European Commission of its proposal for a 2030 Climate and Energy Framework, my Department is undertaking analysis to establish the scale of the contribution Ireland can make to the achievement of the proposed EU renewable energy target of 27%, while ensuring that action taken will be cost effective.</p></reply>

That Memorandum sent a strong signal of our shared interest in exploring the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain and resulted in consideration over the last fifteen months of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries.</p><p>  From the outset, it was our shared understanding that both States would enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement to facilitate renewable energy trading only if it was mutually beneficial to do so.  Significant work has been undertaken on various workstreams including policy, spatial development, regulatory approaches and economic analysis. A full cost benefit analysis (CBA), assessing if it is mutually beneficial for Ireland and the United Kingdom to enter an Inter-Governmental Agreement is substantially complete. From an Irish perspective the potential benefits would include jobs created, community gain, interconnection benefits, corporation tax receipts, rates paid to local authorities and a dividend of trade. This analysis also includes examination of issues such as the amount of energy to be procured by the UK and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant dividend of trade, including an appropriate return to the Irish Exchequer.</p><p>  Based on the CBA, it is clear that under certain sets of arrangements renewable energy trading between Ireland and the UK could deliver significant benefits for both States while also being attractive for renewable energy generators. However, any IGA would have to be designed in a manner that would be workable for both Ireland and the UK.  In this regard, both Ireland and the UK recognise that there are a number of very complex issues that have yet to be resolved in order to deliver renewable energy trading projects, particularly projects focused on delivery for 2020. Key policy and regulatory design decisions remain to be taken by the UK on matters which are central to the design of any energy trading scheme and to the conclusion of an IGA including (i) the maximum quantity of electricity to be procured; (ii) the structure of the payment mechanism, the basis for allocating payments, and the resultant financial flows to electricity generators and tranmission asset owners; (iii) the regulatory approach to the transmission wire; and (iv) the arrangements for sharing the dividend of trading. Certainty on these matters would also be essential for renewable generators if they are to deliver for 2020, given the long lead in time on projects of this nature. </p><p>  As I have explained many times in the House and outside, there can only be an Intergovernmental Agreement if there is considerable value to Ireland in employment and economic terms.  Against that standard and given the issues still unresolved, I made public my judgement after meeting with Minister Ed Davey last week that it is doubtful that the project can be delivered as envisaged.</p></reply>

The first such EU Regulation commenced in 2007. Two further EU Regulations were introduced in 2010 and 2012 to further reduce the maximum permitted retail roaming charges within the EU and to increase consumer protection measures by requiring service providers to inform users of the roaming charges they may incur and additional requirements to curtail services in order to avoid bill shocks in any billing period. The purpose of these recurring EU Regulations is to bring about common tariffs for both national and roaming services within the EU internal market.</p><p>  The current EU Regulation, which commenced in July 2012, imposes two further reductions in retail roaming charges, effective from July 2013 and July 2014. When the second reduction is implemented in July next, the regulated maximum per minute price, exclusive of VAT, will have reduced from &euro;0.49 in 2007 to &euro;0.19 for making a call and from &euro;0.24 in 2007 to &euro;0.05 for receiving a call. In addition the retail price for data services when roaming, will have reduced from &euro;0.70 to &euro;0.20 per megabyte, exclusive of VAT, between July 2012 and July 2014.</p><p>  In addition, the EU Regulation adopted in 2012 also requires mobile service providers to take positive steps to advise customers on the means of avoiding inadvertent roaming, which can occur in border regions when the mobile signal from a service provider in the adjacent State is stronger the signal provided by a user's domestic service provider at any particular location. Mobile phone users can avoid inadvertent roaming by disabling the automatic network selection setting on handsets in favour of the manual network selection mode.  In Ireland the competing service providers offer options for users roaming in Northern Ireland. The available options include roaming calls billed at national rates, no additional charges for calls received and some calls included within bundled minutes. The offers differ from service provider to service provider. Full details of the options available can be obtained from the individual service providers or on the website </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV Licence fee and to the introduction of a household based Public Service Broadcasting Charge, to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses regardless of the device used to access content or services. As the Deputy will appreciate, the introduction of an alternative method of funding for public service broadcasting would require legislative underpinning. </p><p>  In conjunction with this, I am considering possible amendments in relation to certain administrative and operational issues identified in the period since the Act came into effect. While a certain amount of work has been undertaken in this regard, these proposals are still being developed.</p><p>  One such amendment is the proposed amendment to section 39, which I mentioned in the D&aacute;il recently. At present, this section requires every broadcaster to ensure that nothing is broadcast that may reasonably be regarded as causing offence. In my view, this seems to be an unfeasibly rigorous approach. Some people may be easily offended, even where offence was not intended and is not objectively ascertainable. The amendment I am considering would require broadcasters to avoid causing &lsquo;undue offence&rsquo;, which seems to me to be more objective and more in tune with the realities of public debate.</p><p>  The legislative proposals under consideration also include the requisite legislative measures to implement the Government Decision following the completion of the 5 Year Review of public funding for Public Service Broadcasters last year, including a new system of determining the adequacy of funding for public service broadcasters and a revision of the current governance arrangements for advertising minutage. </p><p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, work is continuing on the New ERA efficiency review of RTE as well as on the economic assessment of the advertising market, currently being conducted by Indecon. The outcomes of both these reviews may potentially lead to additional legislative proposals.  Once I have given due consideration to the proposals, and subject to Government consideration, it is my intention to forward the draft Heads of Bill to the Joint Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as &ldquo;3&rdquo;), the NBS broadband service has been available to all premises within the designated 1028 Electoral Divisions since October 2010.A comprehensive assessment of the solution proposed by &ldquo;3&rdquo; was carried by a team of experts, including independent consultants Analysys Mason, to ensure that it would deliver the minimum contractual service levels.</p><p>  During the rollout of services, the level of coverage at Electoral Divisions level was modelled and verified by consultants appointed by my Department prior to certification of enablement. This verification work included the assessment of coverage measurements taken on the ground in 20% of the Electoral Divisions each month. These coverage measurements continue to be provided and analysed throughout the contract period.  Procedures underpinning the ongoing monitoring of coverage, network performance and service delivery were designed as part of the contract. Detailed statistical reports, including traffic and utilisation network data in respect of each element of the network, service parameters such as network availability, speeds, contention and latency are submitted by &ldquo;3&rdquo; and analysed by my Department on a monthly basis. Upgrades of the network and its capacity are automatically triggered at contractually agreed levels of traffic to ensure that the quality of the broadband service is maintained.</p><p>  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service. My Department will then liaise with &ldquo;3&rdquo; personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues and ensure that the service delivered is within the specified limits. </p><p>  On a periodic basis, my Department conducts its own field tests of the service levels received at premises of those customers who have contacted my Department in relation to their service performance. The findings of the Department's field tests are the subject of formal response by &ldquo;3&rdquo; and remedial measures are taken, where necessary, to ensure that all NBS customers enjoy the quality of broadband service foreseen in the NBS contract.  Furthermore, on an annual basis, my Department undertakes a detailed audit of NBS implementation which includes a technical, financial and systems audit as well as inspection of a serving mast site.</p><p>  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met. The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates. I am satisfied that through the combination of monitoring activities and oversight of 3&rsquo;s contractual obligations, my Department can ensure that NBS subscribers are receiving the minimum specified service levels.</p></reply>

The CER aims to publish a public consultation paper on the new connection policy for renewable and non-renewable generators in Quarter 2, 2014. In developing this policy, consideration will be given to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable targets, the requirements of system operators and the likely rate of build out of Gate 3 connections. This consultation will also take account of learnings from the Gate 3 process. As yet, the CER has not taken any decisions on the nature, scale or criteria for connection and access policy post Gate 3.</p></reply>

A project has commenced to test these ducts with a view to bringing them into use as soon as possible. It is envisaged that fibre in these ducts will be available to commercial service providers in areas where next generation access is not currently available. It is intended that a number of interconnection points will be provided which will allow network operators to bring connectivity from neighbouring towns to this fibre. The ducts may also be used to facilitate interconnectivity projects such as that proposed by Emerald Express. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are on-going. Issues regarding obligations which might be placed on any potential contractor to be engaged as a result of the procurement process will be considered as part of the detailed design of the intervention. It is my intention to publish the map showing existing and planned next generation broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for the intervention, later this year.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014. </p><p>  I am aware that at least one commercial operator has launched next generation broadband services in Mayo, and announced plans to bring these services to additional towns over the next two years. Through the combination of commercial investment, the State led investment envisaged in the National Broadband Plan and the initiative to bring the Galway-Mayo ducting into use I am confident that the towns of Kilalla, Ballina, Crossmolina, Foxford, Swinford and Belmullet, and all areas across Mayo, will have access to high speed broadband. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all citizens and businesses to participate fully in a digitally enabled economy and society. I believe that all these developments will enhance the availability of broadband in Mayo.</p></reply>

As different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, no particular technology or network platform should be excluded. The EU State Aid guidelines do, however, emphasise the role of fibre in assisting the delivery of high speed broadband through various platforms and emphasise the importance of having fibre close to the end-user premises. All operators recognise the importance of fibre in the network and commercial operators such as eircom and UPC for example rely on fibre as a significant component in their next generation networks even though the final access into the premises is not necessarily over fibre.</p></reply>

One of the objectives of the Authority, set out in Section 25(b) is to ensure &ldquo;that the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, are upheld&rdquo;.Section 39 of the 2009 Act provides for the duties of broadcasters and includes duties, for example, in relation to objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs. In the discharge of its functions, the BAI is required, under Section 42, to draw up Broadcasting Codes on the standards and practice to be observed by Broadcasters and for compliance matters. In the context of these statutory provisions, the BAI has recently developed Guidelines in Respect of Coverage of Referenda<i>, </i>  to be read in conjunction with the Code of Fairness, Objectivity and Impartiality in News and Current Affairs.</p><p>  It is incumbent upon the BAI and all broadcasters in the State, to ensure that they adhere to these Guidelines, as well as to the spirit and letter of the relevant judicial rulings in this area.  The basis for the practice whereby broadcasters feel constrained to give 50% of airtime to both sides of a referendum campaign derives from an interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>Coughlan v. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission and RT&Eacute;</i>, rather than in any legislative provision or guidance from the Authority.  I have no plans, therefore, to amend the existing legislation in this area. However, as I have said elsewhere, I would invite the BAI and the public service and commercial broadcasters to consider what further refinements can be made to the Guidelines in Respect of Coverage of Referenda, while respecting the strictures of the Supreme Court judgement.</p></reply>

This informs our support for the ongoing political talks among the Northern Ireland party leaders.  The need to deal with prisoner issues was recognised in the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement which committed both governments to provide for the accelerated release of prisoners affiliated to organisations supportive of the peace process.</p><p>  In the context of ongoing attempts to have the institutions provided for in the Agreement established fully, both governments sought to address the issue of those subject to outstanding prosecutions or extradition proceedings who would have been released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement had they been convicted and imprisoned.  While the Irish Government did not operate an equivalent scheme to that at issue in the case mentioned by the Deputy, we would see the administrative scheme for OTRs established by the British government as a natural progression from the agreement made at Weston Park.

In summary, these require contracts for supplies of goods (including food and beverage products) over &euro;130,000 in value to be advertised in the Official Journal of the EU and to be awarded in accordance with legally binding rules on transparency, non-discrimination and other requirements.  A minimum of six weeks must be allowed for tenderers to respond to such invitations, and the contracting authority must normally observe a further &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of 14 days to allow objections from disappointed tenderers before a contract can be formally entered into. On average, a procurement process subject to EU rules will take at least three months from the drafting of the tender documents to award of contract. Such contracts may normally be put in place for up to a maximum of four years, but three years tends to be the normal duration in practice.</p><p>  Contracts between &euro;25,000 and &euro;130,000 in value must normally be procured by advertised competitive process in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and contracts under &euro;25,000 may be procured by inviting competitive quotes from a number of suitably qualified suppliers. Contracts on this scale are not subject to the detailed timeline requirements of the EU Public Procurement Directive, but may nonetheless be subject to general provisions of the EU Treaties regarding non-discrimination and other matters.  The Department&rsquo;s headquarters in Ireland may occasionally have significant catering requirements that arise in the context of major international visits and events such as the EU Presidency in the period January-June 2013, when my Department arranged the procurement of catering services on behalf of all Departments. </p><p>  The procurement of catering for the EU Presidency was subject to a competitive tender process for each of the six months in question.  It was a specification of each tender that suppliers had to confirm that all beef, pigmeat, eggs, lamb, poultry and vegetable products were sourced from suppliers who were listed as Approved Members of An Bord Bia Quality Assurance Schemes.  It would be truly exceptional for any of the embassies to have requirements for food and beverage products greater than the &euro;25,000 threshold mentioned above in any one year, and most of their requirements are procured locally.  </p><p>  My Department and its missions work closely with the Irish promotional agencies including An Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in relation to promoting Irish food and beverage products at appropriate events overseas, particularly during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  If the Deputy has a particular producer or manufacturer in mind that he thinks has good quality products to offer in that context, he can provide me with further details and I will be happy to make enquiries to see what advice and support my Department can provide.</p></reply>

The decision taken by the Government of Myanmar/Burma ordering M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res to cease its activities is deeply worrying. I reiterate calls made by the international community that urge the Government of Myanmar/Burma to grant safe, timely, full and unhindered humanitarian access across Rakhine State to all persons in need.In view of the findings by the EU Delegation in Myanmar during their visit to Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP) Camps in Rakhine, Ireland and our partners in the EU will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those in most need. Ireland together with EU partners calls on the Government of Myanmar/Burma to address the underlying causes of ethnic tensions in Rakhine and guarantee respect for human rights and the rule of law for all people in Myanmar/Burma.</p><p>  Currently, the EU is providing around 70 million Euro to the people of Rakhine State, most of which is used to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of the region. Since 2007, over &euro;7m has been provided by Irish Aid to NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development and emergency and recovery responses in Myanmar/Burma. In December 2013, the T&aacute;naiste announced an additional programme of funding worth &euro;500,000.  Ireland has traditionally supported the efforts of the international community to address destabilising ethnic conflicts and the communities they displace. Ireland, as an elected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, will continue to do so at the 25th Session of the Council currently underway in Geneva.</p></reply>

The agreement reflects the excellent relationship we enjoy with Canada and contributes further to that relationship by fostering increasing personal, cultural and professional ties between our people.  The arrangements for the Programme were set out in a Memorandum of Understanding which was agreed between Ireland and Canada in 2003.  This was amended and expanded in 2012 and again on 6 March 2014, at which point two new categories were brought into the scheme.  </p><p>  Last week I welcomed the signing of the latest amendment to this reciprocal agreement, which will allow more young Irish professionals and students to gain valuable work experience in Canada. I am advised that the Canadian authorities open applications today for 3,000 visas in the new categories, geared towards young Irish professionals and students.  On 13 March, applications open for the working holiday visas which have been characteristic of the scheme since 2003, and open to applicants who do not have a job offer in Canada. The total number of visas available to young Irish citizens this year is 10,700, the largest ever quota for Irish applicants.</p></reply>

The aid programme has the reputation of being one of the best in the world.  Our commitment to development cooperation is clear in the Programme for Government and has been further enhanced by the launch of our new policy for international development - <i>One World One Future.  </i>The policy sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world in which people are empowered to overcome poverty and hunger and to fully realise their rights and potential.   </p><p><i>  One World One Future</i> has a clear focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and sets out three goals:  reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and for the allocation of resources across six priority areas for action deriving from those goals.  These areas are closely aligned with the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals.</p><p>  Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 through 2013 we provided a total of over &euro;1.9bn in ODA.  This is an enormous achievement in the circumstances.  For 2014, the Government has again managed to allocate almost &euro;600 million to ODA, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to helping the poor of the world.</p><p>  As with all major exchequer spending programmes, the annual budget for ODA is ultimately a matter for the Government and is announced by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on budget day.  Our new policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to moving towards the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of GNP as soon as economic circumstances permit.</p></reply>

There are no state or regulatory bodies under the aegis of my Department.  With regard to legal services, my Department generally seeks advice on domestic legal matters from the Office of the Attorney General and/or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. Depending on the subject-matter, domestic litigation is dealt with on my Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office or the State Claims Agency which engage lawyers to act for the Department where necessary and pays their fees.  The Department has a Legal Division, which deals with matters of public international law, human rights law, and European Union law and other relevant legal issues. The Division also acts as agent for the Government before certain international courts and tribunals, such as the European Court of Human Rights. In this regard, it works closely with the Office of the Attorney General, which pays the fees of external lawyers.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s Missions abroad engage local legal advisers from time to time to deal with a range of miscellaneous matters including property, leases and employment law. The amount paid out in respect of legal fees during 2013 by my Department to law firms outside the State for legal services rendered is set out in the table.  The legal services provided to our Embassy in The Hague by Russell Advocaten relate to a local employment matter.<table><tr><th>Company</th><th>Location</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Bamidele Ayura &amp;amp; Company </td><td>Abuja</td><td>1,156</td></tr><tr><td>Campbell Fitzpatrick Solicitors</td><td>Armagh</td><td>662</td></tr><tr><td>Simont Braun</td><td>Brussels</td><td>4,840</td></tr><tr><td>Dra.

We have participated actively in the development of a strong EU response to Russia&rsquo;s military mobilisation while commending the measured response shown so far by the new Ukrainian government.  In relation to the Presidential election scheduled for May, the OSCE on 3 March issued a call to participating states for the nomination of Long Term Observers for the planned observation mission.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of individuals who are available to participate at short notice in election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.  Notification was issued to all roster members last week inviting applications for the observer position.    We aim to respond each year to as many of the requests as possible by the OSCE and the EU for election observers.  To date in 2014, we have put forward nominations to serve in six mission advertised by the EU and OSCE, and we expect requests for participation in at least 11 further missions during the year.   </p><p>  In recognising the vital importance of the Ukrainian election observation mission, we have decided to put forward a Long Term Observer nomination.  Long Term Observers will be required for up to 90 days, which is longer than for most missions of this type.  All of the costs associated with OSCE missions are borne by individual member states.  While no formal call has yet issued from the OSCE for Short Term Observers,  I can confirm that we would hope to be in a position to nominate a substantial number of members of the roster, if requested.   </p><p>  In addition, an Irish officer is also participating in the OSCE observer mission to Ukraine which arrived in Odessa on 5 March.  This is a short term mission of one week&rsquo;s duration during which observers intend to visit Crimea and form an impression of the military situation on the ground.  The mission consists of some 47 military officers drawn from 25 OSCE Participating States.  The basis for the mission is an invitation from the Ukrainian Government under OSCE procedures. </p><p>  Discussions have also been taking place in Vienna at the OSCE Permanent Council on the possibility of establishing a long term presence in Ukraine. This would be a classic OSCE field presence, similar to those in Moldova or Albania. This mission would have at least 100 personnel and would be in place for a minimum of six months. If consensus is reached on the establishment of this presence, Ireland will endeavour to contribute personnel to the mission.</p></reply>

I announced in my Budget 2014 speech that the 0.6% Pension Fund Levy introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011 will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014. I have, however, introduced an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% for 2014 and 2015. I am doing this to, among other things, continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative.   </p><p>  The reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services was one of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the Jobs Initiative. It was due to end in 2013. In my Budget 2014 speech I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The 9% VAT rate has helped to create 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs. Since the Budget announcement about the reduction in the Air Travel Tax, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in significant increases in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>   The additional 0.15% levy for 2014 and 2015 will also be used to help make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties although funds from the levy will not be hypothecated or specifically set aside for this purpose. The Government has decided that such liabilities will be met by the Exchequer as they arise.</p><p>   The chargeable persons for the pension fund levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans. The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, in no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy. </p><p>  I am advised by the Minister for Social Protection that in developing the measures contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act (No.2) 2013, consideration was given to imposing an obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up and to the provision of a pension protection scheme.</p><p>  Defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are set up and maintained by employers on a voluntary basis. There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to their pension scheme (although schemes rules can place some level of obligation). Most defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland were established under a trust deed. As part of the process of establishing each occupational pension scheme, an employer undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to undertake certain liabilities and duties defined therein. The position around the employers and employees contribution obligation in a trust deed varies from deed to deed. </p><p>   Employers have, by and large, made great efforts to support and deliver on the promise made to scheme members. This process is generally managed through dialogue between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability which may include a mix of measures such as increased employer/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits. Given the uncertainties as to the overall impact and potential for unintended consequences of applying an obligation on an employer to secure a minimum level of scheme funding in the event of the wind up of a scheme, it was not considered appropriate to make provision for such a legislative obligation.</p><p>   I am further advised by the Minister for Social Protection that while some countries with very large defined benefit markets provide pension protection schemes it was considered that such an approach was not appropriate for the Irish pensions market. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, provides that, in the event of the wind up of an underfunded pension scheme where the employer is insolvent, the State  guarantees that existing pension benefits will be protected to a level of 50%, with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.   The Pension Board is actively engaged with the schemes which do not meet the scheme funding requirement in order to assist these schemes, particularly schemes in a weak funding position achieve a more sustainable funding position.  </p><p> The overriding priority in this area is to ensure that pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.  The Minister for Social Protection informs me that it is normal practice for her officials to engage with representatives of stakeholders in relation to any substantial change to the Pensions Act. The consultation process which preceded the publication of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill, 2013 included engagement with representatives of pensioners, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions. Written submissions were also sought from these stakeholder groups. </p><p>   The Minister for Social Protection also advises that any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. This guidance makes provision for the notification of all pensioners in advance of any application to the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits. In such circumstances a pensioner will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits. </p><p>  The matter of representation by pensioner groups in consideration of a change to scheme benefits might also be considered in a broader industrial relations context. The Minister for Social Protection has written to our colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.</p></reply>

However, the Government does not produce annual targets for the number of houses to be built.</p><p>  That said, my Department does monitor developments in the housing market.

Such alternative repayment arrangements may include: </p><p>  - an interest-only arrangement for a period of time;</p><p>  - extending the term of the mortgage; </p><p>  - adding the arrears and interest to the mortgage, so that they are collected over the remaining term; </p><p>  - warehousing part of the mortgage, as well as other options outlined in the CCMA.</p><p>   While lenders must consider such arrangements, they are not obliged to offer a borrower in arrears any arrangement or any particular arrangement. </p><p>  If a borrower is offered an alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must give the borrower a clear explanation of the proposed arrangement and how it works, including the reason why the lender considers it to be appropriate for the borrower. The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages. </p><p>  If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must set out the reasons in writing. The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent SFS is available on request, and provide the borrower with details, in writing of: </p><p>  -  other options available;</p><p>  -  the borrowers right to make an appeal to the lenders internal Appeals Board; </p><p>  -  the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland. </p><p>   The same information must be given to the borrower if he/she does not accept the alternative repayment arrangement offered to by the lender.</p><p>  Section 55 of the CCMA provides that complaints relating to the lender's treatment of the borrower's case under the MARP process and the lender's compliance with the requirements of the CCMA must be dealt with in accordance with the complaints provisions set out in the Consumer Protection Code 2012.   This provides a detailed complaints resolution framework which seeks, in the first instance, to resolve matters directly between the consumer and financial institution but, failing that, the matter can be referred to the independent Financial Services Ombudsman.  </p><p>   The Central Bank has informed me that it does not publish the number of non-co-operating borrowers.  However paragraph 29 of the Central Bank's CCMA does provide the following:</p><p>   &quot;where a lender has classified a borrower as not co-operating, following a period whereby the borrower has been given the opportunity to co-operate (in line with provision 28), the lender must notify the borrower on paper or another durable medium that he/she has been classified as not co-operating and inform the borrower of the following: </p><p>  a) that legal proceedings can commence immediately; </p><p>  b) that the borrower is now outside of the MARP and the protections of the MARP will no longer apply; </p><p>  c) other options that may be available to the borrower, such as voluntary surrender, trading down, mortgage to rent or voluntary sale and the implications of each option for the borrower and his/her mortgage loan account, including: <blockquote>  (i) an estimate of the associated costs or charges, where known, and where it is not known, a list of the associated costs or charges; <br /><br />  (ii) the requirement to repay outstanding arrears, if this is the case; <br /><br />  (iii) the anticipated impact on the borrower's credit rating; and <br /><br />  (iv) the importance of seeking independent advice in relation to these options; </blockquote>   d) the borrower's right to appeal the lender's decision, including that the borrower must make the appeal in writing and set out the grounds for the appeal; and </p><p>  e) the borrower's right to consult a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, notwithstanding the fact that the classification as not co-operating may impact on the borrower's eligibility for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. &quot;</p><p>   It should also be noted that even if the MARP process has concluded and where legal proceedings have commenced, the CCMA requires that a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower (and/or his nominated representative) periodically to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed even at that late stage.</p><p>   The Central Bank has also informed me that it does not track the number of borrowers covered under the MARP but does track the number of mortgage accounts in arrears and the number of alternative arrangements put in place across the regulated industry and which are published quarterly by the Central Bank. The latest data published by the Central Bank for end December 2013 can be accessed on the Central Bank's website, .</p><p>   Furthermore, the Deputies may also wish to note, that according to information collected by my Department for the 6 main lenders, in the case of private dwelling homes some 51,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of permanent restructuring following engagement between borrower and lender.  A further 21,000 mortgage accounts in difficulty have been the subject of temporary restructures.  The data published by my Department and the Central Bank would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in early arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.</p><p>   Taken together, the necessary framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p></reply>

A total of 136,564 of accounts were in arrears at end December 2013, a decline of 3.3 per cent relative to end Q3 and that, for primary dwelling mortgage accounts of more than 90 days in arrears, there was a decline of 2.3% over the quarter.  The publication states that the size of the decline was impacted by asset sales over the quarter but the Central Bank has also advised that this does not change the overall arrears trends.</p><p>  The Central Bank accepts that some mortgages are sold to unregulated entities and it has informed me that it is taking steps to address the impact of these loans on its mortgage statistics.  However the Central Bank has also advised that for confidentiality reasons, it is precluded from giving more information on the issue of loan transfers. It is aware of the impact of asset transfers on overall trends and it is putting measures in place to address this, while safeguarding confidentiality.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of securitised mortgages, the Central Bank has informed me that mortgage loans that have been securitised are included in its published mortgage arrears statistics published by the Central Bank.  While it does not publish information on the number of mortgage accounts that have been securitised, the Central Bank has informed me that the outstanding balance on securitised mortgages is available on the Central Bank website in Table A.18.2 at the following location: .</p><p>  The Central Bank has also advised that while it issued a voluntary code of practice in 1991 on the transfer of mortgages, there is no Central Bank requirement, or legislative obligation with respect to which the Central Bank has a role in supervising compliance on a lender to provide notice on the assignment of a loan.  In respect of a mortgage account for which a receiver has been appointed, these are included in the quarterly Central Bank mortgage statistics publication.  In this regard, it should be noted that the latest data published by my Department for the 6 banks covered by the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) shows that at the end of December 2013 those lenders had over 3,100 rent receivers in place.  Regarding letters issued by mortgage lenders demanding surrender or sale, data on this particular aspect are not specifically included in the quarterly statistics published by the Central Bank or by my Department.  However, information on this general area is put into the public domain when the Central Bank reports on progress regarding its MART targets.</p><p>  Overall, the Central Bank is committed to the quality criteria outlined in the  for all statistics published, including the Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics. The Mortgage Arrears return was developed following individual and collective discussions with reporting institutions, and agreement on definitions and coverage. While the data is not audited independently, the Central Bank undertakes extensive validation and consistency checks.  While this is an area that can always be kept under review, I am satisfied that the mortgage data as published is robust and of good quality.</p></reply>

NAMA advises that it only takes enforcement action as a last resort and it is often in cases where a debtor has failed to cooperate or engage with them. The overall level of enforcement in the portfolio is 29% of loan value at year end 2013 which is not high given they inherited a distressed portfolio from the financial institutions.  I agree with NAMA s assessment that its enforcement in Northern Ireland is proportionate to the scale of its exposure to Northern Ireland debtors and properties and in line with the approach adopted in other jurisdictions in which it operates.</p></reply>

It is therefore too early to establish what the overall cost to the State in defending the proceedings will be. </p><p>  Similarly, in the case of the David Hall proceedings the Office of the Chief State Solicitor also represented the Minister for Finance and counsels' fees incurred in those proceedings totalled &euro;111,938.26. As these proceedings have been appealed to the Supreme Court the High Court orders for costs have been stayed. It is therefore too early to establish what the overall cost to the State will be in defending the proceedings will be.  Given the findings of the High Court it is clear that the State has been entirely vindicated in its decision to defend both sets of proceedings.</p></reply>

An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements to their customers in mortgage arrears. Targets have, so far, been set for the period to end of June 2014 and by this date the relevant banks covered by the MART process will be required to have proposed sustainable solutions to 75% of mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears and to have concluded solutions with 35% of such mortgages.</p><p>  2.  Significant reforms to personal insolvency and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, to provide more accessible and flexible statutory frameworks for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position.</p><p>  3.  Updating the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to provide additional safeguards to cooperating borrowers while also promoting and encouraging efforts by both lenders and borrowers to meaningfully address mortgage arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  4.  Mortgage to rent which is now available as a social housing response to allow people to remain in their house, where possible; and</p><p>  5.  The provision of an independent mortgage information and advice service.</p><p>  While the main focus has been on people experiencing genuine difficulty with their mortgage as opposed to those currently experiencing a negative equity situation, the Government is fully committed to helping address the affordability constraints faced by those mortgage holders that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008. In this regard, I have fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  First time buyers now qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. The rate of tax relief on the interest paid on such loans is, for the tax years 2012 to 2017, now 30 per cent.  A document which illustrates the maximum gains for such individuals is available on the Department of Finance's tax policy website at .</p><p>  It is considered that the necessary framework is in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions for dealing with their personal indebted situations.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving the cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the Central Bank's mortgage arrears and restructures statisics and my Department's monthly mortgage data publications shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures are being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</p><p>  In relation to the efforts by Iceland to address mortgage debt, I understand that action is still ongoing in this regard and it is unclear how successful the previous efforts on mortgage principal modification have been.  The Deputy may wish to to note that the Icelandic Government as recently as last November announced further measures to address the mortgage and indebtedness situation in the country.</p></reply>

The proposed extension to the standard rate band is assumed to also apply to married couples and civil partnerships.  On this basis, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, of increasing the standard rate tax band to the PAYE sector by &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000, while also maintaining the current monetary differences between the single persons standard rate band and the various other classes of tax bands, is as follows:   <table><tr><th>Proposed Increase</th><th>Estimated Cost &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;1,000</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;2,000</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;3,000</td><td>430                     </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;4,000</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;5,000</td><td>720</td></tr></table></p><p>   It should be noted that the actual cost for each &euro;1,000 increase may differ from the estimates above as it would be very much dependant on the numbers of taxpayers who are positioned in the income brackets where band increases would take effect and these can vary. With each of the proposed increases, the taxpayers affected are those currently paying income tax at the higher rate, of which there are 352,300 in the PAYE sector.</p><p>  There are approximately 780,300 PAYE taxpayers in employment who are exempt from income tax and 840,200 PAYE taxpayers paying at the standard rate only. These taxpayers would not be impacted by raising the level at which the top rate of income tax is applied.</p><p>  These figures are estimates for 2014, using the latest actual data for the year 2011 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised. A married couple or civil partners who have elected or have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment are counted as one tax unit.</p></reply>

As part of that process, Treasury officials engaged with officials from my Department.  In February 2014, I met with RBS executives to ascertain their outlook for the bank both here and in the UK.  RBS is currently reviewing the operations of Ulster Bank in Ireland with a view to creating a sustainable business model, and on 27 February, RBS re-iterated its commitment to the Irish market.  RBS also stated its intention to build on Ulster Bank's current position to be a compelling challenger bank to the main domestic banks and focus firmly on the customer.  It is good news that the bank has committed so firmly to the Irish market and I think it shows significant support for expanding Ulster Bank's presence in the Irish market.</p><p>  From a domestic banking perspective, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services.  It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit - all of which will become increasingly important as the economy recovers.  Officials in the Department of Finance have been in contact with both RBS and Ulster Bank officials and this will continue as the bank finalises its plans for the future.</p></reply>

Under Section 257 of the Act all deposit takers, including credit unions, are obliged to deduct Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) from payments of interest or dividends made to an account unless the account qualifies as an exempt account.  There is no specific exemption in the case of interest or dividends paid on deposit or credit union accounts held by children.</p><p>  Separately, there is an obligation on a deposit taker to obtain the tax reference numbers of account holders for the purpose of reporting details of certain interest payments to the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation governing this reporting requirement is set out in Section 891B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Return of Payments (Banks, Building Societies, Credit Unions and Savings Banks) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations).  Regulation 7 of the Regulations requires deposit takers to make all reasonable efforts to obtain the tax reference number of any customer who opens a new account on or after 1 January 2009.  There is no requirement to obtain a tax reference number in the case of accounts opened prior to this date.</p><p>  The requirement to deduct DIRT from an interest payment exists regardless of whether the deposit taker is in possession of the tax reference number.  Therefore, in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, DIRT is correctly deductible from the interest payment.  I would point out that there is no distinction between the liability to pay DIRT and the liability to the payment by persons, regardless of age, who do not have a tax reference number of, for example, VAT, or other taxes such as CGT or CAT.</p></reply>

This is part of an agreed consolidation path which Ireland will follow in order to return the public finances to sustainability.  I should point out that Budget 2014 forecast a deficit for 2014 of 4.8% of GDP, which is consistent with achieving a primary budget balance.  In relation to the end-February 2014 Exchequer Returns, I am confident, on the basis of what I have seen to date, we will achieve the targets set out in Budget 2014.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Government has met all of its targets to date and has achieved substantial progress in setting the public finances and the economy back on the road to good health and this has been acknowledged by the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and most economic commentators.  My Department will publish updated macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts in April in the Stability Programme Update.

Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures that are designed to identify and target those who are involved in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the standardised packaging of cigarettes will not damage their work against the illicit tobacco trade, as they rely on the tax stamp to identify tax paid tobacco products and the standardised packaging legislation must accommodate the stamp.  The tax stamp contains all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners currently have three mobile scanner systems.  Two of these are mobile X-ray scanner systems that are based at Dublin Port and Rosslare Ferry Port respectively and which are also available for deployment, on a risk assessment basis, at other ports and locations.  The third is a scanner van, a specialist vehicle incorporating an X-ray facility and radiation detection facilities, the uses of which include monitoring baggage and cargo at ports and airports for tobacco, drugs, radioactive materials or other contraband.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners continuously review their detection technology requirements, taking account of developments in those technologies, and have availed of part-funding under the European Union's Hercule II programme to acquire equipment of this kind.  I understand that they are generally satisfied with their current scanning capabilities and consider that the container ports are adequately serviced by the two mobile X-ray container scanning systems.  I am advised also that the performance of the scanner van since its acquisition is being evaluated on an ongoing basis and that the possibility of augmenting this resource with additional units is being considered.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will maintain their commitment to acting against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.  A new multi-annual strategy for dealing with the problem is being drawn up, and the Revenue Commissioners will consult with key stakeholders in preparing this document.</p></reply>

Alternatively, companies can opt for a write-down of expenditure over 15 years at a rate of 7% per year, with 2% in the final year.</p><p>   Allowances may only be offset against income deriving from activities of managing, developing and exploiting intangible assets as part of a company's trade.  It should also be noted that these capital allowances are ring-fenced for use against the income arising from the intangible asset on which the expenditure was incurred.  This ensures that the capital allowances are only available in respect of income which would likely not otherwise arise.  Also, for any accounting period, the aggregate amount of allowances, plus interest on any borrowings to fund the allowable expenditure, may not exceed 80% of trading income (before allowances and interest) of the relevant trade, with any excess carried forward for offset against trading income in subsequent accounting periods.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated numbers of claims and gross cost of allowances under Section 291A claimed by companies on the corporation tax returns for the tax years 2009 to 2012 are as set out in the following table.  It should be noted that the estimated tax cost shown below is the maximum tax cost associated with the claims in each tax year and takes no account of increased economic activity arising from the measure.<table><tr><th>Tax Year</th><th>Number of Claims</th><th>Estimated Tax Cost </th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>180</td><td>&euro;1.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>176</td><td>&euro;20.3m</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>193</td><td>&euro;76.2m</td></tr><tr><td>2012 (Provisional)</td><td>249</td><td>&euro;108.0m</td></tr></table></p><p>  The estimated cost of the relief in the tax years 2013 and 2014 are not yet available.</p></reply>

The mortgages are generally not sold to the market and do not change form.  When a bank securitises a portfolio of mortgages/debts, it usually transfers the portfolio by way of an equitable assignment or entrustment, which is not the same as a transfer by a bank of its loan book.  When a bank securitises a portfolio of mortgages/debts, the beneficial rights to the portfolio are generally transferred to the purchaser, while the bank remains the legal title holder to the portfolio.</p><p>  The application of the Central Bank's consumer codes depends on the regulatory status of the legal title holder.  Where the legal title holder is a regulated entity, it is required to adhere to the consumer codes.  For example, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to the legal title holder of a mortgage portfolio where that legal title holder is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.  In addition, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1650 is provided as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and<b></b>increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.<b></b> To claim the Single Person Child Carer Credit a claimant must not be married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting.</p><p>  The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base with very few exemptions.  In Budget 2012 I announced that those earning less than &euro;10,036 would no longer be subject to the Universal Social Charge. This in itself has removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge and is of particular benefit to the low paid.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce any further tax reliefs for childcare costs.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. As the Deputy will also appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

It is important to note that schools themselves employ teachers and not the the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  However my Department has issued a number of circulars addressing this issue in recent years. Under these circulars school Principal's must maintain a list of unemployed registered teachers who are available for substitute work at short notice and report to the Board of Management on any exceptional occasion where they have to engage a registered teacher who is retired. Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising registered teachers over retired registered teachers and unregistered people.</p><p>  A retired teacher who returns to teaching on or after 1 February 2012 will commence at the first point of the incremental salary scale. Incremental credit for service prior to 1 February 2012, qualification allowances and certain job role allowances are also not payable. This measure represents a significant financial disincentive for teachers who retired at the top of their salary scale, often with a post of responsibility allowance, to return to teaching. The first point of the teacher's salary scale represents the lowest point or starting salary for teachers. Thus it was decided that retired teachers would be placed at that point of the scale. I will arrange to compile the information regarding the numbers currently working and forward directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The factors include, but would not be limited to, the number of applications, the number of students directly transitioning from second level to third level, the number of mature students entering the system for the first time or re-entering after a break in study, the increases in population in a particular age&ndash;cohort, or area be it rural or urban, the economic circumstances and developments in a particular area, the financial circumstances of individuals and their parents and the increases in attendance at third level generally. </p><p>  In the 2012/13 academic year new applicants applied to Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) and renewal applicants remained with their previous grant awarding authorities (Mayo County Council and Co. Mayo VEC in this instance).  The table details the number of awards (new and renewal) in Mayo for the 2011/12 and 2012/13 academic year. <table><tr><th>Mayo</th><th>2011/12</th><th>2012/13</th><th>% Change</th></tr><tr><td>New</td><td>1,615</td><td>1,679</td><td>+4%</td></tr><tr><td>Renewal</td><td>2,212</td><td>1,783</td><td>-19%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,827</td><td>3,827</td><td> -9.5%</td></tr></table>The above shows that while there was an overall decrease of some 9.5% in total awards in Mayo in 2012/13, the number of new awards made by SUSI actually represents an increase from 2011/12 of some 4%. The creation of SUSI, a single grant awarding agency, and the electronic compilation of data will enable greater visibility and analysis of trends in this area in coming years.</p></reply>

These arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the needs and priorities of the service are met.  Given the importance of the teaching experience and expertise required for the role, it is a requirement for teachers to be a) registered with the Teaching Council and b) in a full-time position recognised by my Department in order to be considered eligible for secondment to the support services.  The support services recruit as needs arise and these positions are advertised through the national media.</p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Teaching Council also has a statutory remit in relation to CPD for teachers. When the relevant section of the Teaching Council Act is commenced, the Council will have a role in reviewing and accrediting programmes of CPD as well as in relation to research on, and promoting the benefits of, CPD.</p></reply>

The circular required all Boards of Management to immediately commence the necessary arrangements for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.

No change has been made to these arrangements.</p><p>  The Guidelines that accompany the &quot;Primary School Curriculum, 1999&quot; acknowledge that carefully selected textbooks may play a role in supporting the implementation of the curriculum but they also warn against an over-reliance on textbooks, stating, for example, in regard to history, that &quot;it should be noted that textbooks, of their very nature, cannot adequately cover local history studies and should therefore be regarded as only one source among many for the teaching of history.&quot;  I am conscious of the additional costs that may have to be borne by parents if workbooks are used extensively in schools and the &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot;, published by my Department in 2012, outline a number of strategies that can be used to obviate the need for such workbooks.</p></reply>

The Occupational Health Strategy comprises of the Employee Assistance and Occupational Health Services and caters for about 64,000 Teachers and 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in 4,000 Primary and Post Primary schools.</p><p>  Medmark Occupational Healthcare is the current provider of occupational health services for teachers and SNAs. The Occupational Health Service encompasses health management and incorporates pre-employment health assessments, sickness absence management referrals, medical assessments of fitness for work and ill health retirement assessments and appeals. </p><p>School authorities have responsibilities for ensuring the health, safety, well-being and educational progress of students. They also have a duty under Section 8 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to &quot;ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of his or her employees&quot;. In order to discharge these management responsibilities effectively, it is essential that employers have access to professional occupational health advice on medical fitness. The Occupational Health Service is in place to assist employers and employees in the timely management of medical problems that arise in the context of work.</p><p>  There are currently 81 Primary and 44 Post Primary teachers on unpaid sick leave. These figures are not broken down on a county by county basis. The number of referrals by schools to Medmark in 2011 was 1,289 and in 2012 was 1,842. Budget 2013 provided for the harmonisation of sick leave referrals with those in the civil service.  This means that schools are required to refer teachers to the Occupational Health Service, after four weeks of sick leave resulting in the number of referrals increasing to 3,566 in 2013.  The level of absenteeism due to sick leave has reduced in recent years with almost an 8% reduction in the past year.</p><p>  Teachers, in accordance with the Education Act 1998, are employed by the school management authority of each individual school. Schools nominate eligible teachers for the payment of incremental salary grant and withdraw nominations on the departure of a teacher for whatever reason. My Department does not require that the school, when withdrawing a nomination, indicate the reason for that withdrawal.</p></reply>

In general, existing eligible and catchment boundary children including those who are not attending their nearest post primary centre retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances. Siblings of these children and other children who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme. Only children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge.</p><p>  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis.

It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils. My Department therefore does not hold details of the number of pupils being supported within each category through this mechanism.

I wish to advise the Deputy also that the NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs has recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.

The findings of this study would have been informed by their previous research in 2004.  The 2004 study found that students who take Transition Year differ in a number of respects from those who do not take the programme.  On average, students who took part in Transition Year achieved higher Leaving Certificate exam grades and were more likely to go on to higher education than non-participants.</p><p>  First, students receive greater exposure to the kinds of subjects they will take for Leaving Certificate.  Second, while being a year older does not seem to enhance academic performance the emphasis on self-directed learning and the perceived consequences of participation for maturity may enhance the study skills of students. Third, research has indicated higher academic performance among students who have had positive interaction with their teachers and a number of students reported improved relations with teachers as a result of taking part in the programme.</p><p>  A number of negative findings were also highlighted by the ESRI. It was found that students who took part in the TY were more likely to work part-time in Senior Cycle and this tended to cancel out the performance gains associated with programme participation. The ESRI also noted that students in predominantly working-class schools where the programme was compulsory did not achieve higher Leaving Certificate grades than their counterparts who had not participated in TY. It was also noted that students in schools where Transition Year was compulsory tended to have higher drop-out rates than their counterparts in schools where it was not compulsory - because they may be unwilling participants in the programme.</p><p>  Transition year is found to have definite academic benefits for students and is thought by the majority of principals nationally to have a positive impact on student development. I am currently awaiting the findings of the Irish Second Level Students' Union study of Transition Year which explores the students' experiences. My Department has funded this study.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making this payment to the Institutes of Technology and apprentices themselves will pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution. From January 2014 up to the end of the academic year in June, apprentices will be due to pay &euro;833 (1/3 of &euro;2,500) per typical attendance block of 10 weeks. The exam fee is included in this payment.</p><p>  Apprentices will pay the same contribution as students, apportioned for the time they spend in the Institutes. Apprentices are not eligible for grants under the Student Grant Scheme as they do not meet the funding condition of participating in an approved full-time course in an approved institution. Unlike students, apprentices are paid a training allowances by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in Institutes of Technology. This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and is unaffected by the budgetary changes.</p></reply>

The document referred to by the Deputy is outdated in that it refers to specific models of provision. My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.</p><p> Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled. I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department provides for a comprehensive system of continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers in the area of special educational needs including teachers of children with autism. Central to this is the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was established in September 2003. The brief of the SESS is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of CPD and support for teachers in mainstream schools, primary and post-primary special schools, and special classes.</p><p>  My Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism.  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism.</p><p>  This child-centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. I have not personally read the research to which the Deputy refers.  However, the National Council for Special Education's 2009 publication &quot;International Review of the Literature of Evidence of Best Practice Provision in the Education of Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot; makes reference to both experts referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is currently developing policy advice on the educational provision for children with autism which is being prepared at my request.  The SESS has a number of teams involved in the provision of CPD and support to teachers of students with challenging behaviour; the Challenging Behaviour Team, the Autism Team and the Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis Team.  One full-time SESS team member holds a BCBA qualification with three others currently having post-graduate qualifications in this area.</p><p>  As outlined in my previous response, it is a matter for schools to determine the approach or mix of approaches which they will use in each individual case.  In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  In general, the Board has the responsibility to ensure that the school operates efficiently and effectively.  However, it is the Class Teacher and, to a lesser extent, the Principal, who interact with the children on a daily basis.  The approach towards each child's education would be based on the individual educational needs of the child and would have regard to the child's individual education plan and supporting professional reports, etc. and would require the interaction of all school personnel involved in the provision of education to the child.  Details on the numbers of early intervention classes for children with autism who use ABA are not available as this information, while available in individual schools, has not been collated by my Department.</p></reply>

The Council also operates in accordance with the European Directive for the mutual recognition of qualifications 2005/36/EC for the teaching profession. The Council does not register persons for professions other than teaching.  The Council does not limit a teacher's period of registration to three years. In circumstances where a teacher does not meet all of the registration requirements at the time of registration, he/she may be granted conditional registration for a period of time in order to meet all of the registration criteria.  The period of conditional registration does not normally exceed three years (which is the case for teachers registered in accordance with the European Directive).  The three year period is normally adequate for a teacher to meet the additional registration requirements and get full registration.</p><p>  Since April 2013, all registration applicants are required to have a teaching qualification at the time of application.  Those who do not have teaching qualifications are not eligible for registration under regulations 2, 3 or 4.  For those who are seeking registration under regulation 5 (and do not have a recognised teaching qualification), registration is granted on a conditional basis for a period of three years to enable the teacher to complete a recognised teaching qualification.  If the teacher does not complete a recognised teaching qualification within the three year period or if the specified period is not extended on the basis of extenuating circumstances then his/her registration will lapse.</p><p>  In situations where a teacher cannot meet the requirements of a registration condition due to extenuating circumstances, he or she can apply for an extension to the specified period.</p></reply>

However, it is considered unlikely that funding conditionality would include explicit prohibitions such as those stated by the Deputy. In addition to the issue of the appropriateness of imposing such prohibitions, the question of effectively assessing compliance with them would arise.</p><p>  As I advised in my reply of 6 February to an earlier question from the Deputy, the conditionality linked to receipt of Departmental funding generally requires compliance with a number of standard criteria, including: satisfying eligibility requirements of the scheme or programme in question; reporting of projected and actual expenditure; assessment of programme activities and impacts; and full receipting of income and expenditure, with independently audited accounts.</p><p>  In relation to State bodies in particular, the 2009 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies specifies the framework agreed by Government for the internal management and the internal and external reporting relationships of commercial and non-commercial State bodies. It also advises state bodies involved in service provision to develop service level agreements. While the Code does not specify particular clauses that are required to be included in such agreements, it requires State Bodies to serve the interests of the taxpayer, pursue value for money in their endeavours and act transparently as public entities.</p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to table a further question regarding a specific aspect or specific recipient of Departmental funding I will arrange to have this considered.</p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have therefore arranged for the Deputy's questions relating to provision at post primary level to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p><p>  SENOs are also a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children or on deciding the most appropriate placement for their child. SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie. The NCSE has published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School. This guide is also available on their website.  The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Educational Welfare Services, Child and Family Agency, can be contacted at 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  Where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p></reply>

This report has been developed following a review of best practise in both national and international research, and follows a wide process of engagement and consultation with parents of children with special educational needs, representative groups, educational partners, voluntary bodies and advocacy groups.</p><p>  The report proposes that a new model for the allocation of supports for children with special educational needs should be introduced and it includes a number of recommendations on how this could be achieved.</p><p>  I will now consider the Report's recommendations carefully with my Department and consult with my colleagues in the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy, before bringing this report forward to Government in the near future.  Subject to Government approval, it is envisaged that the NCSE would then publish the report, and that my Department would begin the process of planning for the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p></reply>

Following the tender process and before a contract is put in place, the recommended bidder must satisfy the standard requirements which are taken from the Department of Finance Capital Management Works Framework. These requirements include confirmation of tax clearance.</p><p>  With regard to building projects funded by my Department, contractors wishing to tender for major projects must sign a Personal Situation Declaration under Oath confirming that they are in compliance with Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006. Any contractor failing to provide this declaration is excluded from tender competitions.  Contractors must also produce a Tax Clearance Certificate, or, demonstrate a satisfactory level of tax compliance before they are awarded a contract.</p><p>  A building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc. In general all sub-contractors employed on education sector building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors.</p><p>  Following a tender process last year, my Department appointed a private company to conduct random audits on school building projects to verify compliance with the relevant clauses in the Public Works Contracts. If an audit uncovers any matters of concern regarding tax compliance such matters will be referred by my Department to the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that issues relating to tax compliance fall within the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. The Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) system introduced in 2012 applies to all payments made by a principal contractor to a subcontractor under a relevant contract (this is a contract to carry out, or supply labour for the performance of relevant operations in the construction, forestry or meat processing industry). RCT applies to both resident and non-resident contractors operating in the construction, forestry or meat processing industry.</p><p>  If the Deputy has information of instances where irregularities have occurred then my Departments advice is that these should be notified by the Deputy to the Revenue Commissioners. </p></reply>

Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland. </p><p>  The core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Study.  The CFRAM Programme, currently  being undertaken by OPW with its technical consultants, and in partnership with local authorities and other stakeholders, entails comprehensive catchment-based studies.  Under the Programme, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design.  These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan. More information on the Programme is available on <i>.</i></p><p>  The Shannon CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.  The Shannon River Basin District covers some 17,800kms2 and includes parts of 17 counties.  A total of 66 locations along the Shannon have been identified for further assessment under the Study. The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.</p><p>  Under the Study, work on Draft Flood Maps will be finalised during 2014 and Flood Risk Management Plans are due to be finalised in 2015.  The Shannon CFRAM Study involves public consultation with individuals and organisations who have an interest in the Shannon including property owners, recreational users, the farming community and environmental stakeholders.  The extensive consultation with stakeholder groups under the study is a recognition of the multifaceted nature of the Shannon river system and its diverse uses and functions.  The examination of flood risk management options for the Shannon will also give due consideration to its varied uses and functions through the application of a Multi Criteria Analysis which takes into account Environmental and Social criteria as well as Economic and Technical criteria.

It is open to all members of the public regardless of gender, political affiliations or location to apply for appointment to these vacancies.  I am satisfied that the new arrangements introduced by the Government in 2011 have significantly improved transparency in the making of appointments to State Boards compared with the making of appointments in previous years.</p><p>  A new website portal,<i></i><i>,</i> created by the Public Appointments Service is offering a single dedicated point of contact to all Government Departments as a support to existing Board member selection procedures.  This portal facilitates:</p><p>- The advertising of opportunities to express an interest in state board vacancies and the terms and conditions pertaining to same;</p><p>- The registration by prospective Board members of their general interest in a position on a state board;</p><p>- The sending of alerts to those registered on   (and formerly on publicjobs.ie) of state board vacancies as and when they arise.</p><p>  There may have been a different ethos in the public sector compared to the private sector a few years ago but large changes have been made in the public sector in recent times leading to very similar fundamental values now.  I agree that there may still be a need for a more proactive approach in attracting expressions of interest but I think the public is beginning to realise now how much the public service has changed which will hopefully alter any negative perceptions of the public sector as an employer in the future.  The work expected of a candidate would be very challenging and the remuneration package would reflect this. Being previously employed in the public sector does not gain any advantages for a candidate.</p><p>  Persons being proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State Bodies/Agencies may be required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach which they will take to their role as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or Board in question and, following that discussion, decisions will be taken by either the Government or myself, as appropriate, to confirm the nominee as chairperson.</p><p>  Since the formation of this Government 22 members have been nominated to the two State Boards under my remit.  In view of the statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Public Appointments Service, there is limited scope for me to make such appointments.</p></reply>

Significant damage to OPW assets on the River Maine catchment occurred during the recent storms.  The OPW is currently in the process of rectifying these issues, but it is difficult to provide a time-line on when exactly specific areas of damage will be addressed due to many of the sites being inaccessible at this time and the solutions complicated. The works at these sites require planning and preparation and must take into account environmental considerations and other factors.  However, I am advised that any major blockages within the system have been addressed to date and the OPW is continuing to deal with the issues as quickly as possible with the resources available.</p></reply>

The OPW will be writing to the Council shortly in relation to the matter. </p><p>  Details on the funding sought by Galway County Council in relation to the repair of damaged infrastructure other than coastal protection and flood defence structures is not available to the OPW and the Deputy should request this information from the relevant Departments concerned i.e. the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to damage to piers and harbours and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to damage to roads and other coastal amenities.</p></reply>

Significant damage to OPW assets on the River Maine catchment occurred during the recent storms.  The OPW is currently in the process of rectifying these issues, but it is difficult to provide a time-line on when exactly specific areas of damage will be addressed due to many of the sites being inaccessible at this time and the solutions complicated.  The works at these sites require planning and preparation and must take into account environmental considerations and other factors.  However, I am advised that any major blockages within the system have been addressed to date and the OPW is continuing to deal with the issues as quickly as possible with the resources available.  </p><p>  Staff from the OPW's South West Region Arterial Drainage Maintenance Division are currently working at Laghtacallow, where they are building haul roads allowing for access to import subsoil and rock armor to repair the affected defences at this location.  There are approximately 1.5 km of defences here requiring some form of attention.  It is hoped that works at Ardcanaght can commence by late April or early May.</p></reply>

In addition, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in Pathways to Work, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. </p><p>  The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, published by the Central Statistics Office in February, showed that the number of people in employment increased by 61,000 year-on-year in the fourth Quarter of 2013, net of a reduction of 5,500 people in the public sector. This was the fifth quarter in succession where employment has grown year-on-year.</p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs was published by the Government on 27th February and builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans. This year&rsquo;s Plan includes targets for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) will target the creation of 13,000 new fulltime permanent jobs and target &euro;17.5 billion in exports by client companies in 2014. IDA Ireland will also target 13,000 new gross jobs in 2014 and work to win another 155 new FDI investment projects, with 20% of those from growth markets. In addition, a further 10,000 jobs (6,000 direct and 4,000 indirect) will be created over a five year period. It is expected that these new jobs, will in turn, lead to many thousands of additional jobs in the domestic supply and services industries.  EI is focussed on job creation and export growth and offers a broad range of supports for entrepreneurs, start-ups and business growth, in addition to supporting the work of other players, public and private, in stimulating job creation at local and national levels.</p><p>  With particular regard to Dublin&rsquo;s Northside, funding for a Business Development Manager was approved for Coolock Enterprise Centre, Ballymun Enterprise Centre, Darndale Belcamp Initiative Ltd, SPADE Enterprise Centre and Balbriggan Enterprise Centre, under the Community Enterprise Centres (CEC) Funding Scheme.  A total of 630 people are employed in these five CECs.</p><p>  In 2013, 50% of the investment announcements made by IDA Ireland were for Dublin and in 2014 to date, there have already been five company announcements for Dublin.  Additionally, there have been announcements by four high-growth start-ups for Dublin with a combined total of 102 jobs requiring a variety of skillsets.  IDA is actively engaged with its existing client base, existing pipeline clients and key stakeholders such as the HEA, Third Level Institutions, Solas and the Department of Social Protection etc. regarding the provision of the skills required in respect of Foreign Direct Investment<i>.</i></p><p>  Dublin City and Fingal County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can provide supports, both financial and non-financial, to all micro-enterprises in the start-up or expansion phase in manufacturing and services, subject to certain conditions.  The soft supports include the provision of business advice, mentoring and training to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area. Anyone interested in starting or expanding their own business should, in the first instance, contact their local County and City Enterprise Board (CEB).  Contact details for the CEBs are available on .</p><p>  In Budget 2014, the Government has provided a total of &euro;18.5m for the CEBs to support enterprise development, an increase of &euro;3.5m on the Budget 2013 Estimate.</p></reply>

I understand from IDA Ireland that the Agency has identified a number of locations where the private sector is unable to develop property solutions at present.  In order to boost regional development and win new business, IDA Ireland proposes to build new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone, and office space in Letterkenny.  These particular locations have been chosen on the basis of projected opportunities, for which IDA Ireland are competing at present.  The Agency is also reviewing the available property stock in Galway and Limerick.</p><p>  I should add that IDA Ireland has already invested in a number of Business and Technology Parks in Galway city and county - Parkmore, Oranmore, Ballinasloe, Tuam, and Loughrea - and has purchased land for future strategic development in Athenry. The Agency also partners with the private sector in the promotion of appropriate property solutions for FDI. </p><p>  With regard to the specific requirements of the Manufacturing Sector, the availability of suitable property at the right price and in the right place has long been an essential contributory factor in Ireland&rsquo;s success in developing this sector.  I am committed to ensuring that policy initiatives will address our ability to deliver property solutions which will cater in particular for the next wave of investment in advanced manufacturing.  The shifting nature of the sector in higher technology activities is likely to place greater demands on high quality water, waste water, waste infrastructures and energy, which will also be addressed.</p><p>  It is also worth remembering that County Galway has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment particularly in the areas of Medical Technologies and ICT.  There are currently 60 IDA Ireland client companies employing some 13,615 people in Galway, city and county.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.548.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100062#WRL01200"><p>On 16 January 2014 the Government approved the text of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill, subject to such drafting and technical changes as may be agreed with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am informed that work is progressing on these necessary technical changes and that the Bill will be published at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>  The overriding objective of this Bill is to provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s skills needs.  The Bill will:</p><p>  - update provisions for the employment permits schemes in line with policy and economic developments since 2007;</p><p>  - provide the flexibility to deal with changing labour market, work patterns and economic development needs which often require rapid response;</p><p>  - provide for a robust employment permits regime with greater clarity; and</p><p>  - address deficiencies identified in the legislation with the potential for employers to benefit from (at the cost of the employee) from the un-enforceability of employment contracts in situations where an employee does not hold an employment permit but is required to do so.</p><p>  The law is clear on the matter of employment of third country nationals - it is illegal for such a third country national to be employed without the State&rsquo;s permission and it is an offence for both the third country national and the employer concerned. It is not my intention to change this legal principle in any way.  Illegal employment of third country nationals creates two problems. Firstly, it creates a serious problem for the employees concerned in that they do not have a legally binding contract of employment and cannot therefore rely on such a contract in asserting their rights under the contract and under the wide spectrum of employment rights legislation.  We saw the result of this in the High Court judgement concerning Mr. Younis which overturned a decision of the Labour Court to award Mr Younis back-pay on the basis that by virtue of Mr Younis not having an employment permit, the contract of employment was illegal. The Employment Permits Acts do not currently provide for any defence for an employee, which suggested to the High Court that it could not take into account any mitigating circumstances and had little discretion but to consider the contract of employment as illegal. The Bill will amend the legislation in order to provide a defence for the employee which will then give the courts some discretion on the matter.</p><p>  I am also very mindful of the second problem created by the illegal employment of 3rd country nationals namely, that it enables unscrupulous employers to undercut legitimate competitors and places the third country national in a position which can be exploited to the employer&rsquo;s benefit. Therefore, the Bill will introduce new safeguards that will ensure that the situation which arose in the Younis case will be prevented in future in a manner which does not undermine legal principles and ensures that an employer cannot benefit from the fact that such contracts of employment are illegal and therefore not legally binding.</p><p>  Another key feature of the new Bill will be the establishment on a statutory footing of an Employment Permit for dealing with third country nationals who have, to use a parlance, &ldquo;fallen out of&rdquo; the Employment Permits regime. I recognise that there can be situations where such a third country national can find themselves falling out of the Employment Permit&rsquo;s regime through circumstances beyond their control or even as a result of their omission to keep their Employment Permit up to date. I recognise that such people may have established roots in Ireland and that it can be in the public interest to facilitate a reactivation of their inclusion within a legal employment framework through the granting of an Employment Permit. </p><p>  I should also point out that it continues to be the case that an employer can be prosecuted for breaches of employment law including the Employment Permits Acts and it is the National Employment Rights Authority&rsquo;s policy to pursue such breaches. NERA has secured convictions of a number of employers in respect of violations of employment law in cases involving the employment of workers without permits or immigration permissions.</p></reply>

While there are excellent and committed people working in the five existing Workplace Relations Bodies, often with challenging workloads, clearly the system itself has not performed and needs to be changed. Indeed, there is universal acceptance of the need for root-and-branch reform of the existing structures and processes which have evolved in an ad hoc fashion over the last eighty years. These deficiencies have given rise to, among other matters, complexities for practitioners and users of the service, multiple points of entry to the system, forum shopping, long delays<b></b>in<b></b>scheduling hearings and issuing decisions.</p><p>  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  A new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. </p><p>  A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes. The Draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage.  My intention is to publish the Bill during the Spring/Summer Dail session 2014 with a view to having the new structures in place during 2014.</p><p>  The Workplace Relations Bill will provide for the following measures:</p><p>  -  The services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to come together under the remit of the WRC.  The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.</p><p>  -  The establishment of the Office of Director General of the WRC; appointment of the Director General by the Minister on specified terms of appointment; the statutory powers and functions of the Director General.</p><p>  -  The staffing of the WRC by officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  -  A statutory basis for the use of innovative measures such as Compliance Notices and Fixed Charge Notices to enhance the compliance functions of the WRC.</p><p>  -  The sharing of employment related and other specified information between the WRC, the Labour Court and other official agencies in the context of promoting compliance with employment legislation.</p><p>  -  The appointment of additional members to the Labour Court to facilitate the increased workload of the Court in the new system.</p><p>  -  A new more transparent system of appointment of adjudicators of the WRC and Chairs, Vice-Chairs and ordinary members to the Labour Court.</p><p>  -  A new streamlined system for the enforcement of awards under employment legislation.</p><p>  -  Necessary and consequential amendments to existing employment, industrial relations, equality and other legislation.</p><p>  -  Better enforcement of employment rights awards and better compliance and enforcement measures for employment rights.</p><p>  Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, insofar as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme are concerned. A Single Contact Portal, e-complaint facility, Staffing and Structures Plan, Workplace Relations website, early resolution service and enhanced technologies and processes have already been put in place. Tenders for the supply and commissioning of a customer relationship management solution are currently being evaluated. This solution will underpin and support effective and efficient service delivery. Arrangements for the recruitment, selection and training of adjudicators and the rationalisation of accommodation and hearings venues are at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

To date, there have been 4 schemes and 159 centres have been approved for financial support, of which 117 have been completed. </p><p>  The question posed by the Deputy regarding the breakdown of the total spend by year requires a significant volume of information to be gathered and correlated by Enterprise Ireland and it has not been possible to provide the information within the timeframe concerned.  Consequently, I will provide this information, when it is provided by Enterprise Ireland, to the Deputy as soon as possible in written format.</p><p>  In January 2014, the results of a survey confirmed that CECs accommodate 1,119 companies employing 4,759.  55 of these companies are Enterprise Ireland clients and 174 are clients of the CEBs.  The NACEC is a network of the 117 community enterprise centre managers. Its primary role is to support and develop the interests of community enterprise centres on a national basis. Many centres were developed in areas of low employment and population, with the support of Enterprise Ireland, the CEBs, Local Development Groups and other local community organisations.  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that, since 2008, they contribute &euro;10,000 to the NACEC each year to run their operations, such as website build, bi-monthly meetings, promotion and advertising and national co-ordination of the 117 CECs.</p><p>  At present, there are 46 Business Development Managers in the CEC network throughout the country, which have been supported by Enterprise Ireland under the 2012 CEC Business Development Manager Scheme.  I have also been informed by Enterprise Ireland that there are 16 other managers across the network, which have not been funded by Enterprise Ireland.  All of these managers are part of the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres (NACEC).  </p><p>  The City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can only fund CECs that are already being funded by Enterprise Ireland and can only fund to a maximum of 50% of the Enterprise Ireland contribution.  The detailed information sought by the Deputy is not readily available within the CEBs and its compilation, which would involve a search through over 20 years of records in each of the 35 CEBs, would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach's visit, which included stops in Philadelphia and Cleveland, was aimed at delivering a message to international business people, investors and the Irish diaspora, that Ireland is open for business.  Over the course of the visit, the Taoiseach:</p><p>  - Officially opened the new US headquarters for Enterprise Ireland client, Zenith Technologies, in Philadelphia;</p><p>  - Travelled to the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Ohio, a globally renowned and leading US hospital across a variety of specialties. Enterprise Ireland, working with the Cleveland Clinic, arranged for the Taoiseach to speak at the City Club of Cleveland which was hosted by the Clinic on the main campus of the hospital.</p><p>  - the Taoiseach and Frank Ryan, the then CEO Enterprise Ireland, were given a guided tour of the Cleveland Clinic by the Clinic&rsquo;s CEO, Dr Toby Cosgrove, a key figure in advising US policy on healthcare reform.  As part of this event, the Taoiseach formally announced the investment by Enterprise Ireland and Cleveland Clinic in Irish-based High-Potential Start-Up (HPSU) company i360 Medical &ndash; the first time the Clinic had invested in a company overseas.  The Taoiseach subsequently met with a variety of Irish companies which, through the work of EI, have established a relationship with, and subsequent presence at, the Clinic.</p><p>  - Enterprise Ireland also hosted a private dinner for its clients with the Taoiseach, senior leadership of the Cleveland Clinic and the CEO of North Shore Long Island Jewish, another high-profile hospital in New Jersey.</p><p>  The companies that attended at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to the Cleveland Clinic did so in a private capacity and were not part of the official mission.

In this regard, I note that the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation has indicated that around half of its members expect to experience some level of pay increase over the next 18 months.  However we must not lose sight of the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s economy had become increasingly and critically uncompetitive in the five years up to 2008. Regaining cost competitiveness, which has included wage restraint among other things, has been key in our fight to recover. We must be very careful that the gains so hard fought for over the past few years are not eroded. </p><p>  Indeed, it could be argued that we have further to travel in this regard. According to the 2013 Forf&aacute;s Report on Labour Market Competitiveness, despite some reductions, labour costs in Ireland remain above OECD averages. The Report found that Ireland has the 17th highest total labour cost level in the OECD-32 and the 11th highest net wage level in the OECD-32. </p><p>  We know that some sectors are expanding at a faster pace than others while some are only beginning to stabilise and return to growth. In this context, I have noted IBEC&rsquo;s view that local bargaining based on company-level realities is the appropriate manner in which to deal with wage pressures at this stage.  It is my sense that, for the moment, firms and employers are taking stock of how the next 24 months will possibly pan out. Each assessment will be different and I do not believe that there is a homogeneous model for all Irish business at the moment. Rather, I think that employers must make their own assessments based on their personal experience of how their own business and sector is performing. These assessments, in turn, will inform their view as to the level of wage increase, if any, they see themselves as being able to afford.  It is vital that any wage increases negotiated are not excessive, do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities, increase costs locally or impact on our competitiveness internationally.</p><p>  With some exceptions, Ireland has been through a period of industrial peace. IBEC and ICTU have agreed two separate Private Sector Protocols for the Orderly Conduct of Industrial Relations and Local Bargaining. This has played a significant role and I would hope that any disagreements arising during pay negotiations where they arise at company level do not cause industrial unrest.</p><p>  It is an area I am monitoring closely. The next 18 months will be key in terms of getting the economy expanding again and I am determined to ensure that the gains achieved and the image of Ireland as the best small country in the world in which to do business is not damaged.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s 2013 report on Ireland&rsquo;s industrial performance acknowledges that, while challenges remain, the economic adjustment programme that has been implemented by the Government has had a positive impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.</p><p>  More widely, Ireland is rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to compete in global markets.  Ireland has moved up to 17th place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013, having being ranked 24th only two years ago.  Ireland ranks 6th of the 28 EU Member States in this index.  Ireland is ranked 15th in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2014 Report and rates 5th of the EU 28 in this report.  In addition, Ireland was recently named by Forbes magazine as the &ldquo;Best Country for Business&rdquo;.</p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops the various global competitiveness rankings, including in relation to:</p><p>  -  business impact of rules on foreign direct investment;</p><p>  -  inflation;</p><p>  -  FDI and technology transfer;</p><p>  -  availability of skilled labour;</p><p>  -  flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and</p><p>  -  investment incentives.</p><p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years, we must continue to do more, to ensure that these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover.</p><p>  Through the Action Plans for Jobs process, the Government has focussed on measures aimed at restoring our competitiveness position and creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, which was published at the end of February, places a particular focus on improving competitiveness in all areas of economic activity and contains a range of specific measures which will deliver further improvements in our international competitiveness performance.  These measures include the regular monitoring of competitiveness issues by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs, which will consider specific initiatives to make it easier to do business in Ireland.  The Government will receive a report from the Cabinet Committee on a quarterly basis on these issues.</p><p>  Other competitiveness measures in the Action Plan for Jobs cover improving cost competitiveness, supporting competitive regions, aligning skills with enterprise needs and using research and innovation to drive job creation.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s exit from the Troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.</p></reply>

The focus is on prioritising public investment in research and development while better exploiting results in order to lead to an acceleration of growth and job creation.</p><p>  A number of initiatives are being rolled out across Government in support of this strategy, including the following:</p><p>  -  Research Prioritisation seeks to maximise the impact of our spend by focussing the majority of public competitive research funding on 14 priority areas which are most likely to deliver societal and economic impact, particularly in the form of jobs.</p><p>  -  The remit of Science Foundation Ireland has been expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities.</p><p>  -  In order to ensure industry are in a position to exploit opportunities to commercialise the fruits of state investment in R&amp;amp;D, the Intellectual Property Protocol gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research. A Central Technology Transfer Office has been established to provide an effective interface between industry and the research community.</p><p>  -  The R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme continues to encourage business to invest in research as seen in recent figures which show Business Expenditure in R&amp;amp;D continuing to grow, creating new product and service innovations that will drive exports, growth and jobs.</p><p>  -  Smart investment in research centres of scale with critical mass will deliver maximum impact on jobs and research excellence.</p><p>  Evidence, both from the EU and internationally, shows that this strategy is paying off.  It was most encouraging to see that the 2014 European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published last week, shows Ireland increasing its position from tenth to ninth in the overall ranking of 28 EU Member States. It is particularly encouraging to see that Ireland is the overall leader in the indicator of the economic effects of innovation - this captures the economic success of innovation in employment in knowledge-intensive activities, the contribution of medium and high-tech product exports to the trade balance, exports of knowledge-intensive services, sales due to innovation activities and license and patent revenues from selling technologies abroad. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s recent ranking of 10th in the Global Innovation Index 2013 which is also a very positive affirmation of our capabilities in this area. Additionally, we are in the top 20 in global international scientific rankings and in particular, Ireland is ranked:</p><p>  -  1st in molecular genetics,</p><p>  -  2nd in probiotics,</p><p>  -  3rd in immunology,</p><p>  -  6th in nanotechnology,</p><p>  -  8th in materials science and</p><p>  -  10th in computer science.</p><p>  We have also set an ambitious target for Irish researchers of winning funding of &euro;1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.  A comprehensive national strategy is being implemented which will direct our engagement in Horizon 2020 and ensure that we maximize the benefits for Ireland.  </p><p>  Finally, despite the economic downturn, we are still on track to achieve our research intensity target under the Europe 2020 Strategy which is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels in this sector to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP). The latest available data show that the research intensity rate for 2012 is 2.13% of GNP (1.72% of GDP).</p></reply>

SMEs make up over 99% of businesses in the enterprise economy in Ireland and account for almost 70% of people employed.</p><p>  One of the measures introduced by Government is the &ldquo;Action Plan for Jobs&rdquo; which contains a suite of actions specifically aimed at supporting small businesses.  The Deputy will be aware that significant progress has been made in a number of areas, including:</p><p>  -  Improving Access to Finance through the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme;</p><p>  -  Reform of the County Enterprise Boards through the establishment of new Local Enterprise Offices;</p><p>  -  Improving access to examinership for small companies through the Companies Bill;</p><p>  -  Tackling the issue of late payments through the transposition of the EU Late Payment Directive into Irish legislation; and</p><p>  -  Development of a Single Licensing Application Portal.</p><p>  Also contained within the Action Plan for Jobs is a Government commitment to publish a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.  This Policy Statement, which is due to be published in Q1 of 2014, will complement the existing business support initiatives to ensure that the operating environment is more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship.  </p><p>  A key Government priority in 2014 is to raise awareness amongst SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full suite of developmental business supports available through a comprehensive communications strategy involving the widest possible range of stakeholders.  The new Local Enterprise Offices, as an interface with business at local level, will have a central role to play in this regard, especially in relation to SMEs. </p><p>  The Action Plan 2014 continues on from the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 commitment by Government to support SMEs.  Almost all actions contained in this year&rsquo;s Plan will impact on the SME sector generally or specific groups of SMEs.  Actions around the skills agenda, support for research and innovation, support for management development and other capacity building measures are set out in the Plan.  Sector-specific actions in areas such as food and drink, retail, construction, tourism, creative services, eHeath and the Green Economy aim to provide new opportunities for SMEs to win business both in Ireland and overseas.  </p><p>  In addition to work under the Action Plan for Jobs and measures contained in Budget 2014, the Government has ensured that on-going dialogue with the small business sector is in place so that businesses and Government can work together to identify necessary actions to support SMEs in Ireland.  This is being facilitated through the Advisory Group on Small Business and the High Level Group on Better Regulation, both chaired by the Minister for Small Business, Mr. John Perry, T.D.</p></reply>

A return to wage bargaining is already visible in certain sectors of the economy. In this regard, I note that the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation has indicated that around half of its members expect to experience some level of pay increase over the next 18 months.</p><p>  However we must not lose sight of the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s economy had become increasingly and critically uncompetitive in the five years up to 2008. Regaining cost competitiveness, which has included wage restraint among other things, has been key in our fight to recover. We must be very careful that the gains so hard fought for over the past few years are not eroded.  Indeed, it could be argued that we have further to travel in this regard. According to the 2013 Forf&aacute;s Report on Labour Market Competitiveness, despite some reductions, labour costs in Ireland remain above OECD averages. The Report found that Ireland has the 17th highest total labour cost level in the OECD-32 and the 11th highest net wage level in the OECD-32. </p><p>  We know that some sectors are expanding at a faster pace than others while some are only beginning to stabilise and return to growth. In this context, I have noted IBEC&rsquo;s view that local bargaining based on company-level realities is the appropriate manner in which to deal with wage pressures at this stage.  It is my sense that, for the moment, firms and employers are taking stock of how the next 24 months will possibly pan out. Each assessment will be different and I do not believe that there is a homogeneous model for all Irish business at the moment. Rather, I think that employers must make their own assessments based on their personal experience of how their own business and sector is performing. These assessments, in turn, will inform their view as to the level of wage increase, if any, they see themselves as being able to afford.</p><p>  It is vital that any wage increases negotiated are not excessive, do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities, increase costs locally or impact on our competitiveness internationally.  With some exceptions, Ireland has been through a period of industrial peace. IBEC and ICTU have agreed two separate Private Sector Protocols for the Orderly Conduct of Industrial Relations and Local Bargaining. This has played a significant role and I would hope that any disagreements arising during pay negotiations where they arise at company level do not cause industrial unrest.</p><p>  It is an area I am monitoring closely. The next 18 months will be key in terms of getting the economy expanding again and I am determined to ensure that the gains achieved and the image of Ireland as the best small country in the world in which to do business is not damaged. </p></reply>

It is a novel Scheme in an Irish context and it is currently developing a position in the Irish financial arena.  </p><p>  My Department, along with the CGS operator, Capita, and the participating lenders has committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of this Scheme. While demand for the scheme has been lower than anticipated, it has, nonetheless to year end 31 December 2013 supported additional lending of some &euro;9.788 million to 72 companies and supported 409 new jobs, while maintaining 236 jobs. The recently completed review of the Scheme has recommended some changes that could lead to increased take-up if they are addressed. We are nearing completion of the review process, having consulted widely with stakeholders on the proposed changes. I will shortly be bringing a Memorandum to Government seeking approval to amend the Credit Guarantee Act and I am confident that the necessary legislative amendments will be made by the Oireachtas in the coming months, with a view to the earliest possible re-launch of the scheme. </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund is aimed at a very different type of enterprise and was introduced following demands from business interests for the introduction of supports for microenterprises in a difficult economic environment.  Microfinance Ireland (MFI) has now developed a presence in the Irish financial market.  To year-end 31 December 2013 &euro;2.159 million has been approved to 137 microenterprises supporting 310 jobs. While take-up is lower than expected, the Scheme is demand-led and may be a reflection of the muted level of demand for credit as evidenced in the Department of Finance commissioned SME Credit Demand Surveys.</p><p>  I intend to commence a review of the operation of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Acts 2012 by Q2 2014.  The purpose of the review will be to seek to enhance the uptake and impact of the Fund and I can assure the Deputy that I will take all recommendations into consideration with a view to improving the overall take-up of the Fund.</p></reply>

The most recent invitation took place in December.  Appointments made on foot of Expressions of Interest have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.

In general, people are only permitted to access their pension savings at the retirement age defined in their pension schemes. Schemes may have early retirement provisions from age 50 and when retirement is caused by ill-health, benefits may be paid regardless of age. In the case of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs), benefits may be taken at any time after age 60 and from any age in the case of ill-health.</p><p>  The Minister for Finance announced, as part of Budget 2013, that access to 30% of Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) on pensions will be allowed subject to a marginal tax rate of 41%. This option to withdraw is available for 3 years from the 27 March 2013. The introduction of this measure is designed to allow people, who have provided for a good retirement through a core pension but who have an immediate financial need, to access a portion of their pension pot before they retire. There are no plans to extend this limited access option further.</p><p>  There are a number of reasons why early withdrawals of pension savings are generally not permitted, the principal one being that funds, and the associated tax relief on contributions, are designed to support people in later life to ensure they have an adequate income. This requires that pensions must be long term vehicles based on the principle that savings will be &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; until retirement.  The issue of early access has been considered in detail by an inter-departmental ad-hoc group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection. The group concluded that the principle of pension savings being &ldquo;locked away&rdquo; until pension age should be maintained. The Interdepartmental Group on Mortgage Arrears also examined the issue of early access to pensions and did not recommend such an approach.</p><p>  If people are allowed to access their pension savings early, the resulting reduction in pension savings could have significant negative consequences in the longer term. Younger people in pension schemes are unlikely to have significant pension savings and where their pension scheme has incurred losses, as many have over the past number of years, early withdrawal of funds would mean very poor value for money. There is no guarantee the funds could be repaid or that people could make up these losses. Where people are close to retirement, an early withdrawal of funds could significantly diminish the pension they receive as they may not have time before retirement age to fill the gap left by such a withdrawal.</p><p>  At present, only 51% of people in employment aged 20 to 69 have pension coverage. This relatively low rate of pension coverage is a major concern. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage and allowing people access to their pension savings before pension age would run totally counter to the policy of encouraging more people to save more for their retirement.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are currently approximately 8,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for in 2014.</p><p>  Since June 2012, to ensure that those who were in mortgage difficulty engaged with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and avail of its forbearance arrangements, mortgage interest supplement has not been payable until applicants had agreed with their lender and complied with an alternative payment arrangement for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months. The expenditure on the scheme was some &euro;55 million and provisionally &euro;35 million in 2012 and 2013 respectively, in line with a reduction in the numbers of customers in receipt of the supplement from 18,700 in January 2012 to 9,800 in December 2013.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:</p><p> - Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers.</p><p> - A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent).</p><p> - Comprehensive advice to borrowers.</p><p> - Personal Insolvency Reform.</p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient. </p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over the next four year period. It is expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme is aimed at employers with a view to incentivising the employment of people with disabilities in the open labour market. The WSS is payable where the employee works a minimum of 21 hours per week, and the employer must apply the same conditions of employment as for other employees &ndash; including minimum wage, PRSI, PAYE and annual leave requirements. The scheme is not statutorily-based and the operational guidelines require employees to surrender their primary social welfare payment if they take up employment for which the employer will receive a payment under WSS.</p><p>  However, the legislation governing disability allowance (DA) allows claimants to avail of an earnings disregard (up to &euro;120 per week without affecting their DA payment) if they take up employment (certified to be of a rehabilitative nature) and in practice, the WSS operational guidelines are not taken into consideration, so DA remains in payment.  I should state that the Department is carrying out a comprehensive review of the employment support schemes which transferred from F&Aacute;S with a view to ensuring that the range of measures in place is fit for purpose &ndash; to facilitate and support people with disabilities to avail of employment opportunities.</p></reply>

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS. </p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to people on the live register by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with people who are unemployed and in particular those who are, or become, long term unemployed. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.  It is in this context that the Department took a decision to rebalance resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location. </p><p>  In the instance where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service. All affected customers have been written to advising them of the dedicated email addresses and phone lines that have been set up allowing in many cases, for customer queries to be processed without having to attend a clinic. In addition, customers have also been advised of the new postal addresses of the Intreo offices and the clinic opening hours. In the event that a face to face meeting is still necessary, but the customer is unable to travel to the public clinic, for example due to illness, an officer will arrange a visit to the customer&rsquo;s home. </p><p>  The relocation of services coincides with greater integration between the community welfare service and other locally based staff of the Department. This process is being enhanced by the recent roll-out of a full Intreo service to Achill, Belmullet, Castlebar and Ballina and to Westport later this year. This roll-out has resulted in the frequency of available public clinics being increased to 5 days per week in Castlebar and Ballina, 3 days per week in Westport, and 2 days per week in Belmullet. In addition, the number of staff available in these offices will be increased, giving customers improved access to services.</p><p>  The Department is continuously reviewing the staffing needs for all areas of its business, to ensure that the best possible use is made of available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society. </p></reply>

At no time did she state her intentions regarding the course, i.e. that she planned to partake in a single semester only. In January 2014 she submitted her application and the Deciding Officer subsequently informed her that her application could not be approved. The reason for this is that a single semester is not considered to be full-time education as set out in the operational guidelines for BTEA. This scheme is designed to support a person for study for the full academic year rather than on a modular or semester basis.  Given the nature of BTEA, no provision is made to allow a person to complete an individual semester of a full-time course.</p><p>  Following a comprehensive review of this case, there are no records that the person concerned was informed by any officer of the Department that she could intermit her back to education allowance payment and resume it at a later date for a semester. Only general advice regarding the application process is given by staff to applicants; confirmation is not given as to whether or not a person qualifies for BTEA.  The BTEA guidelines provide that any person who is not satisfied with a decision may request in writing a review by an officer of the relevant Social Welfare Local Office enclosing new evidence in support of the review. BTEA is a non-statutory scheme and as such decisions cannot be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;31.3 million for the scheme in 2014.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Reductions announced as part of Budget 2014 will be achieved by on-going review of recommended payment rates under the ENP scheme to ensure consistency with regard to payment levels on a national basis.</p></reply>

The exclusive function of the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, SIU, is to investigate and report on fraud and abuse of social welfare schemes.  It involves a broad range of management, liaison, enforcement, investigative and intelligence gathering duties and operates at the high or more organised end of social welfare fraud and abuse.  The Unit carries out a wide range of control activities and projects and it also works closely with Revenue staff in Joint Investigation Units, with staff from the National Employment Rights Authority, the Garda&iacute; and other compliance and enforcement agencies. </p><p>  There are currently 91 staff in the SIU.  In addition, 5 others are seconded to the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and 2 are in the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  The secondment of 20 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Department to assist the SIU with fraud investigation work has been agreed by myself, my colleague Alan Shatter T.D., Minister of Justice and the Garda Commissioner.  This proposal is being progressed at present and I expect the officers to be seconded to the Department over the coming months.

A dedicated phone number and a facility on the Department&rsquo;s website is available for this purpose.  It should be borne in mind that while there is often a perception of fraud, when a case is examined the individual may, in fact, be doing something that is allowed under the rules of the particular payment that they receiving. For example, a person can work and receive a One Parent Family Payment, provided their earnings are within the limits and the Department is aware of the situation.  </p><p>  All anonymous or confidential reports are examined and, where relevant, are referred to scheme areas or inspectors for follow-up action.  While a payment is not suspended or stopped on the basis of an anonymous report, the report may, however, &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; a review of a customer&rsquo;s entitlement.  Anonymous reports are not available to Deciding Officers when they are making their decisions on cases.  The Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision must be based on the full facts and circumstances of the case and, as a result, statistics are not available on the outcome of anonymous reports.  The following are the number of anonymous reports received in the Department&rsquo;s Control Division in the period 2011 to 2013: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013 </th></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>16,917</td><td>28,022</td><td>24,720</td></tr></table></p><p>  There were 22,420 reports processed in 2013.  A report of suspected fraud was referred to the relevant area for examination in 15,431 of these cases and 6,989 other cases were not referred for various reasons such as, not possible to process due to lack of information, no claim being in payment or the information reported had no impact on entitlement. </p><p>  The following is the scheme breakdown of the reports referred to scheme areas for further investigation:<table><tr><th>Scheme Breakdown</th><th>No.</th></tr><tr><td>Jobseekers cases (include JA &amp;amp; JB)</td><td>6,196</td></tr><tr><td>SWA</td><td>3,177</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family cases (include WOPS)</td><td>3,892</td></tr><tr><td>Illness</td><td>2,151</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>462</td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>3,462</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19,340</td></tr></table></p><p>  The total scheme breakdown is more than the 15,431 cases referred as some clients may be in receipt of more than one payment.</p><p>  As outlined above, anonymous reports are used to &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; or instigate investigations but they do not form any part of the evidence and are not taken into account when the review of the customer&rsquo;s payment is being decided.  Therefore, detailed statistics of the timeframe taken to investigate anonymous reports, the number of investigations pending or the outcomes of anonymous reports are unavailable.  Furthermore, anonymous or confidential reports of abuse do not form any part of the evidence when a case is being considered for prosecution.</p></reply>

Based on previous attendance rates at similar Department of Social Protection events, some 5,000 customers were expected to attend over the course of the day. </p><p>  However, it was decided before lunchtime to close the event due to the unexpectedly high numbers attending in the first hour and the consequent traffic difficulties this was causing in the area.  The Department is now conducting a review of the arrangements put in place for the Fair, with a view to ensuring there is no repeat of the problems at future such events.  Of the invitation letters issued in advance of the Fair, 1,000 stated that if the customer did not attend, it could be taken into account at a later stage.  However, in light of the situation which arose these customers will not be affected in any way.</p></reply>

The Operating Procedures for CE schemes outline the required ratios of supervision to number of participants; 1 to 25 participants on mainstream CE projects. Where the number of participants exceeds 25, an assistant supervisory post can be approved. However CE schemes involved in the drug rehabilitation strand have a lower participant to supervisor ratio due to the different nature of the clients participating on those schemes. The standard ratio is 7 drugs rehabilitation-referred participants and 2 mainstream participants to 1 supervisory post for dedicated drugs rehabilitation schemes.  This adjusted ratio was agreed, in consultation with statutory, community and voluntary sector representatives, under the nine special conditions to support the delivery of drug rehabilitation places on CE.</p><p>  Departmental officials met with representatives from the Community Lynks Special Drugs CE scheme on Thursday 27 February 2014 to discuss matters in relation to a particular situation that has arisen in the scheme; a six month contract for a temporary supervisory post was a due for completion on Friday 7 March 2014.  However, this has been extended for one month to facilitate the scheme with regard to maintaining a sufficient number of participants to warrant this post.

However, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA). </p><p>  A humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009.  The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  Levels of payment under the scheme depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses.  </p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the DSP generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p><p>  - Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer.  Payments are made immediately following the impacts of severe weather mainly in respect of food, clothing, toiletries and accommodation. </p><p>  - Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  Payments are being issued under this stage to customers affected by the recent severe weather with payments ranging between &euro;2,000 and &euro;4,000. </p><p>  - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response.  The type of work carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring, painting etc.  Payments under this phase will generally take longer to process as homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders&rsquo; estimates and the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor, in cases where significant amounts are claimed. </p><p>  Department officials are liaising with local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected by the recent flooding as swiftly as possible.  Any person who is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.</p></reply>

The vacant place can then be taken up by another eligible person.  A full 52 week placement is deemed to be of sufficient duration for the majority of participants to become &ldquo;job-ready&rdquo;.

This includes information regarding participants&rsquo; options on exiting the programme, such as progressing into further training e.g. with the local Education and Training Board to enhance their skillsets and qualifications, or by availing of the services of the local Job Club to assist in gaining employment.</p><p>  As a general rule, for a person who has exited CE to be considered<b></b>for re-entry, 12 months need to have elapsed since any previous participation and he/she must have been in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment for that 12-month period (i.e. they requalify for further time on CE under the standard CE eligibility conditions).  This is subject to availability of places and compliance with the participation time limits i.e. 3 years cumulative participation for those under 55 years of age, or 6 years cumulative participation for those of 55 years of age up to state pension age.  Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-related social welfare payment can qualify for 1 additional year&rsquo;s participation on top of those maxima.

The review envisages the complete or partial de-designation of 46 existing NHAs where turf-cutting may continue into the future. In these de-designation cases, it will not be necessary for individuals to seek consent to cut turf.  The effective cessation of turf cutting is on 36 NHAs by 1 January 2017, in order to preserve their conservation value. Management plans, which will be subject to environmental assessment, will be prepared for each site. Turf-cutters on these sites will require consent from my Department before cutting this year.  The proposed designation of 25 new sites as raised bogs NHAs later this year is to replace the habitat lost through de-designation of the more heavily cut sites. Many of these proposed sites are in public ownership, or have relatively few or no turf cutters.  </p><p>  It may be noted that it has been possible to subdivide seven current NHAs in such a way as to allow for a continuation of turf-cutting in one part and conservation elsewhere on the site. This has resulted in a total of 82 separate units within the original 75 NHAs. </p><p>  Any turf-cutter required to cease turf-cutting on an NHA is being offered compensatory measures similar to those available to turf-cutters from raised bog Special Areas of Conservation. Such compensation will be available to qualifying persons with effect from 2014.  The maximum payment available under the scheme is &euro;23,000 currently made up of payments of &euro;1,500 per annum (index linked) over 15 years with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500, upon completion of a legal agreement with me as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

These applicants may opt for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while awaiting relocation.

Under the Wildlife Acts, hares are a protected species and may only be hunted during the Open Season, as prescribed by the Wildlife (Wild Mammals) (Open Seasons) Order 2005.  The NPWS statement referred to comes from the 2006 Report to the EU on the status of Habitats and Species protected under the Habitats Directive. That part of the Report references a number of scientific research papers which are used to inform the comments on hare population demographics. The quote reflects an opinion that further scientific research would be useful to ascertain the effect of hare coursing captures on hare population demographics. However overall, the evidence suggests that that the impact of coursing on the conservation status of hares nationally is negligible and may in fact have direct and indirect benefits for hare populations.</p><p>  In 2013, Ireland submitted a second such report, which is available online at www.npws.ie. This second report identified changes in agricultural practices as the main pressure facing this species, in particular intensification of grassland usage. The scientific assessment was that the species is in favourable conservation status and the report on the hare concluded that &ldquo;the hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche. None of the identified threats are considered likely to impact on its conservation status.&rdquo;  The most recent population estimate for the species was 535,000 animals. Coursing Clubs affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club capture in the region of 5,600 hares each coursing season, equivalent to approximately 1% of the national resource, and figures show that an average of 97.5% of the hares used at hare coursing meetings are returned to the wild.</p></reply>

This decision has been made in view of the economic downturn, the ongoing cost of maintaining the airstrips and the position that my Department is unlikely, at any time in the near future, to have the resources to subsidise a regular air service between the island and the mainland. My Department is currently assessing the disposal options available to it and a decision in this regard will be announced in due course.  The airstrips on Inishbofin and at Cleggan in Co. Galway are not open or licensed for use by the Irish Aviation Authority at present. Therefore, landing aircraft on the airstrips is currently strictly prohibited.</p></reply>

The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets.  It was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets.  However, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans.</p><p>  I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project within the current fiscal constraints. In this regard, I established an Inter-Agency Group on the Ulster Canal to explore ways to advance the project and to examine possible funding options for it, including existing funding streams and the leveraging of funding from other sources.  The Inter-Agency Group has met four times, last meeting on 9 December 2013.  The Group continues to examine leveraged funding opportunities for the project.  This includes the exploration of EU funding which may be potentially available in the next round of structural funds covering the period 2014 - 2020.  </p><p>  In the meantime, the Ulster Canal project is progressing on an incremental basis. Planning approvals have been received for the project in both jurisdictions. Compulsory Purchase Order land maps are in preparation and consideration is being given to how the construction work and other technical aspects of the project will be structured and the necessary lands secured.</p></reply>

The VFM Review and public consultation will inform proposals on the shape of the charge, including decisions with respect to the collection agent, which I will bring to Government in due course. As the Deputy will appreciate, the replacement of the existing funding system based on the collection of television licence fees with one based on the imposition of device-independent charge on eligible households and businesses is a complex process and the logistics involved require thorough attention.

In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.

Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.784.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100066#WRP04600"><p>In May 2012 the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture published its Report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration. The Report contains a number of recommendations in respect of the fiscal and regulatory framework applying to oil and gas exploration in Ireland. At my request the Report was debated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 27 June 2012 and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 14 May 2013, with the debate concluding on 9 July 2013.</p><p>  Some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations are both sensible and desirable, others are already provided for in the existing licensing and regulatory regime while there are a number of recommendations that could usefully be explored further, including several which have wider public policy implications. There are also a number of recommendations in respect of which I have strong reservations and remain to be convinced that their adoption represents the best way to proceed.</p><p>  With regard to the recommendation in respect of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, this Act provides the legislative underpinning to the regulatory framework applying to oil and gas exploration in Ireland. Since it was enacted, a broad body of legislation at national and European Union level that is directly relevant to petroleum exploration and production activities, including planning, safety and environmental legislation, has been passed. Against that background, my Department is currently engaged in a review of the 1960 Act.  I concur with the recommendation that there should be no changes to the fiscal and licensing terms applying to existing agreements, given the need for the licensing regime to communicate both stability and certainty to industry. This is especially true where Ireland is competing with other countries to attract investment and where the nature of the business requires the taking of a long-term view.</p><p>  With regard to the recommendation in respect of obtaining geological data from all licensees, this provision is already included in the work programme of licences issued by my Department. The recommendations relating to the maximisation of production from a commercial field, the principle of unitisation and the issue of flaring of gas are already addressed to a considerable degree by the existing licensing terms, together with my Department&rsquo;s own industry-specific rules and procedures.</p><p>  On the matter of public consultation, all major infrastructure consent processes in this State involve a public consultation phase, which generally includes an oral hearing. These requirements are not industry-specific and they flow from both national and European legislation. This means that any future oil or gas development project would be subject to a number of consent processes, each of which would have a detailed public consultation phase.</p><p>  The &ldquo;community gain&rdquo; concept discussed in the report is clearly not industry-specific. The Strategic Infrastructure Act now enables Bord Plean&aacute;la to attach specific community gain conditions to a planning consent. The Government fully supports a community gain approach in the delivery of energy projects. This is explicitly referenced in the Government&rsquo;s<i></i>  Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which was published in July 2012 and which now guides the planning authorities in their decision-making. That Policy Statement stresses the need for developers to examine appropriate means of building community gain considerations into project budgeting and planning.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy regarding oil and gas exploration is outlined in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Statement of Strategy 2011-2014. My Department has also contributed to the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth: An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland policy document.  <font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></p><p>  Regarding the recommendation that my Department should have on-going contact with other countries, my officials have regular interaction with their equivalents in other administrations at EU and International fora.</p><p>  In respect of the recommendation that a forum comprising key stakeholders be established to improve communications between stakeholders and maximise the potential for the Irish people of Ireland&rsquo;s hydrocarbon resources, I would point out that my Department engages on a regular basis with elected representatives, other state bodies, industry interests, community interests, non-governmental organisations and the general public on this issue.</p><p>  Insofar as the changes in the tax regime proposed by the Report are concerned, these are not minor or modest in nature. The Report proposes a fundamental re-positioning that would raise Ireland&rsquo;s tax to a similar level as that of the UK and, in the case of very profitable fields, would impose a higher tax here than would apply in Norway. During the course of the D&aacute;il debate I stated my intention to seek further independent expert advice on the &ldquo;fitness-for-purpose&rdquo; of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal terms, such expert advice to focus on what level of fiscal gain is achievable for the State and its citizens and, equally important, on the mechanisms best suited to produce such a gain.</p><p>  On 5 March 2014 I announced that my Department had selected international oil and gas experts Wood Mackenzie to advise on the &ldquo;fitness-for-purpose&rdquo; of Ireland&rsquo;s current oil and gas fiscal terms. Wood Mackenzie, who have considerable experience in providing fiscal advice to a broad range of clients, including governments, have now commenced their work and I look forward to receiving their expert advice. It is intended to bring consideration of this matter to a conclusion in the coming months. This will ensure that the next licensing round can be launched against a backdrop of regulatory certainty and encourage new investment in exploration.</p></reply>

Exploring offshore the west coast of Ireland is expensive relative to other petroleum producing areas due of its remoteness and deep water depths. For example, in the Atlantic Margin water depths are 7-8 times greater than that of the North Sea. This is reflected in the cost of drilling a single deep-water well in the Atlantic, which can be expected to cost in excess of &euro;100m.</p></reply>

The introduction of Postcodes will give rise to significant economic and social benefits including:</p><p>- Enabling organisations to improve existing services and develop new service offerings, including the SME sector;</p><p>- Delivery of improved efficiencies with regards to logistics including emergency service response;</p><p>- acting as a strong support for the development of digital applications in the Irish economy;</p><p>- Improved efficiency and accuracy of internal business processes as a result of improved accuracy and consistency of databases across public and private sectors;</p><p>- Better planning and analysis capabilities across public and private sectors;</p><p>- Providing a stimulus to mail volumes through improved direct marketing capabilities;</p><p>- Facilitating improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector; and</p><p>- Better targeting of services to local areas and development of customised services for localities.</p><p>  An Post will be highly involved in the dissemination and the rollout of the National Postcode System and will see a substantial sustained benefit as the introduction of postcodes is likely to result in an immediate and sustained increase in mail volumes as businesses update database systems to include postcodes.</p></reply>

Critical among these, are initiatives in relation to the digital economy and improvements to energy efficiency. The National Digital Strategy was published in 2013 and contains a series of actions aimed at stimulating digital engagement. A key initiative in the Action Plan for Jobs, reflecting commitments in the National Digital Strategy, is the implementation of a Trading Online Scheme. This initiative aims to help Irish businesses improve their competitiveness and grow by having access to new markets and a wider customer base. A Trading-online Voucher scheme is being designed and will be rolled out nationally later this year. The scheme will target 2,000 small Irish businesses over a period of two years. A study by the European Commission estimated that companies that have a meaningful online trading presence, grow twice as fast, export twice as much and employ twice as many people. With 70% of Ireland's annual online spend currently going overseas, targeting Irish businesses for online trading is a key jobs and economic imperative.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs and the National Digital Strategy also underline the importance of ensuring young people are equipped with the skills required for the modern economy. My Department and the Department of Education and Skills are funding an ambitious programme that will see all second level schools in Ireland having a 100Mbps broadband connection by the beginning of the 2014- 2015 school year. In tandem with this, my Department is engaging with schools to optimise the use of technology in the classroom. Together with curriculum developments being overseen by the Department of Education and Skills, these programmes aim to position Ireland's future workforce to compete and contribute in an increasingly global jobs economy. </p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs also includes the further implementation of the National Broadband Plan as a priority action. The National Broadband Plan will facilitate the provision of high speed broadband across the country. This in turn should help smaller non-urban businesses to realise the full potential of trading in a digital economy and stimulate growth in rural areas. </p><p>  As set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, over the period to 2020, it is intended to transform Ireland into one of the most energy efficient economies in Europe, yielding a significant jobs dividend in a range of areas, including retrofitting, energy management services and the development and manufacturing of energy efficient products.</p><p>  Under the 2014 Plan, &euro;13.5 million will be provided for the Better Energy Communities scheme, &euro;20 million for the Better Energy Homes scheme and &euro;20 million for the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme in 2014, which collectively will sustain 3,500 jobs in energy efficiency installations.  2014 will also see a broadening and deepening of supports to industry. A key initiative in this regard is the financing of energy efficiency improvements through the Energy Efficiency Fund. It is envisaged that the Fund will make commercial finance available to two main types of energy efficiency projects in public and commercial sectors, Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) where funding is lent to an Energy Services Company (&ldquo;ESCO&rdquo;) and direct lending to the client company.</p></reply>

It is estimated that around 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its commitment of 40% of electricity demand being met by electricity generated from renewable resources by 2020. This is necessary to meet our overall target of 16% of our energy demand being met by renewables by 2020.The issuing of grid connection offers under the Gate 3 process was largely concluded towards the end of last year.</p><p>  Oversight of the Gate process is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Operation of the process is carried out by the independent system operators, ESB Networks as the Distribution System Operator, and EirGrid as the Transmission System Operator. I am advised by EirGrid that the total number of grid connection offers made by the system operators under Gate 3 was 162. This equates to 5,327 MW of generation capacity and includes both renewable and conventional generation projects. To date 140 applicants have accepted their offers. This equates to 3,697 MW of generation capacity, the bulk of which is renewable. A further 14 grid connection offers are still live. This equates to 1,037 MW. The remaining 8 connection offers, which equate to 593 MW, have lapsed. This information is available on both the EirGrid and ESB websites.</p><p>  I understand that the full cost for a developer of connecting to the grid is a combination of many factors, only one of which is the cost of connection charge payable by each developer to the relevant system operator. Therefore, the full cost of connection to the grid for an individual developer varies greatly according to the nature of each connection, and, consequently, is not known to the system operators.</p></reply>

It has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  A report on the &ldquo;State of Broadband&rdquo; published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2013 ranks Ireland 35th of 183 countries for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants; 19th of 170 countries for mobile broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and 31st of 192 countries with 79% of the population accessing the internet using broadband.</p><p>  Comparisons of broadband statistics by the OECD and other statistical reporting bodies concentrate on the headline speeds or averages of broadband speeds marketed by the largest operators in each country. These reports demonstrate the international trend in markets delivering higher broadband speeds over time. These comparisons do not measure how accessible those higher broadband speeds are within countries. Such comparisons must be interpreted with caution, as the OECD itself advises. The most recent OECD report on marketed broadband speeds, up to September 2012, ranks Ireland 11th  highest, equal with countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the highest marketed download speed available at 100Mbps. These tables do not, however, quantify the proportion of households, located in less densely populated areas, who cannot access these higher speeds. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and </p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  The commercial market is now delivering speeds up to 200 Mbps in areas served by UPC and eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps. I have recently introduced legislation to enable ESB to utilise its extensive distribution network to provide next generation broadband services. In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.</p><p>  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the requirements set by the EU Commission in its &ldquo;<i>EU Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation to the rapid deployment of broadband networks</i>&rdquo;. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout the country. I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.839.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100068#WRR00600"><p>The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation porfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Figures for 2012 show that 19.6% of electricity demand was met from renewables.</p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, around 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. Further increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio will reduce our dependency on expensive imported fossil fuels. Analysis undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland shows renewable electricity has displaced over &euro;1 billion worth of fossil fuel imports - mainly gas - in the last five years and has reduced CO2 emissions by 12 million tonnes.</p><p>   EirGrid's most recent Generation Capacity Statement, covering the period 2013 - 2022, deals with both renewable and conventional sources. The median electricity demand scenario is based on the ESRI&rsquo;s Recovery scenario in their Medium Term Review and Eirgrid generation portfolio assumptions. The results for Ireland show it to be in surplus of over 1,000 MW for most years. This begins to fall off towards the later years as older plant is assumed to come to the end of its useful life. EirGrid has also made a high demand forecast, based on the possibility of a very cold winter (the coldest out of ten years). In this scenario, the surplus is reduced by about 100 MW from the Base Case. However, EirGrid has also stated the need for reinforcment and upgrading of the high voltage transmission grid to ensure that reliable electricity supplies can be maintained to all regions, and allow Ireland to attract and retain investment and create jobs. This work is being carried out by EirGrid through their Grid 25 programme and is also essential if we are to leverage our abundant, indigenous, renewable energy resources and realise the potential they offer for reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels. The renewable energy sector has also been identified by both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as a key growth area in their clean technology strategies. Therefore, increasing the renewable element of our energy mix will contribute to improving our energy security and our economic development.</p></reply>

Technology advances will continue in the sector, with the biggest developments expected to take place in the areas of range increases and reduced recharging times for electric vehicles. EVs currently on the market are offering ranges under 200km per charge. This compares to ranges of approximately 170km two to three years ago. It is expected that similar evolutionary increases in range will continue. This will be delivered through improved battery technology and vehicle design. Such increases in range will impact on the longer term requirements for charging capability such as public charging points and I understand that this is being evaluated by the ESB on an ongoing basis including as part of its current electric vehicle trial.</p><p>  The ESB is also actively monitoring developments in charging technologies and is working closely with motor manufacturers, charging equipment suppliers and international standards bodies to ensure that Ireland is well prepared for such developments.  The level of electricity system impact over the next twenty years of electric vehicles will depend on the level of uptake in the vehicles over that period. The EV Roadmap prepared by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is an estimate of the possible long term electrical energy requirements for electric vehicles operating on Ireland&rsquo;s electricity network and the associated benefits out to 2050 based on a number of different deployment scenarios. </p><p>  The report, available on the SEAI website, shows that the electrical demand on the system is unlikely to impact the business as usual development requirements for the electricity grid until 2040. Even then, it finds that charging strategies and time of use pricing methods could be employed to avoid the need for additional grid capacity development until beyond 2050. The reason for this is the high energy efficiency of the EV and the drop in electrical power demand at night time. EVs, therefore, could increase the utilisation of this spare night time capacity and, in doing so, make better commercial use of the existing electrical network assets.</p><p>  The ESB is also evaluating, through the current EV trial, the impact that electric vehicles are likely to have on the overall energy requirements and the resulting network implications in order to plan for and accommodate the expected increase in demand for electric vehicles over this period. In addition, SEAI has a demonstration project on the Aran Islands which is used to provide evidence of the effect of using electric vehicles on energy imports and energy efficiency gains. I understand that the results of this work will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

EirGrid has set out its vision for development of the national transmission system through the Grid25 Strategy which was published in October 2008. In accordance with its statutory and licence responsibilities as the Transmission System Operator (TSO) the company has prepared a Transmission Development Plan (TDP) for the period 2013&ndash;2023. The TDP presents the developments which will be required to deliver the Grid25 Strategy, meeting future requirements as they are known at this time including the requirement to accommodate renewable generation. The vision articulated in the Grid25 Strategy is assessed and reassessed on a regular basis having regard to current and future demand and other factors, and is consulted on through the TDP. Details of the Strategy and the TDP for 2013-2023 are available on the EirGrid website. In addition, at a project level, detailed needs assessments for each of the major Grid25 projects have been undertaken and are available on Eirgrid's website. Grid requirements for wind energy produced for export would be dealt with separately from that produced for domestic energy needs, and are in not related to the Grid25 Strategy. </p></reply>

Our choices on the nature, type, and origin of fuels we use to provide heating, facilitate transport and generate electricity are profoundly important to our energy and decarbonisation policy objectives. Ireland has made significant progress towards achieving our legally binding target of 16% renewable energy by 2020, with overall renewable penetration at 7% in 2012. Further work will be necessary to realise the 2020 objective. Alongside our renewable targets, oil and gas remain a critical component of our energy mix, providing 76% of primary energy requirement in 2012.   The Government has also put in place a set of supports, ranging from capital supports for certain types of renewable energy technology, across the industrial, institutional and industrial sectors. These include the REFIT Scheme, a fixed feed in tariff system, which is leveraging investment in renewable electricity capacity, which is critical to Ireland delivering our targets under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>  Ireland has excellent renewable energy resources, which will be a critical and growing component of Irish energy supply to 2020 and well beyond. Indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in the country&rsquo;s domestic fuel mix, increasing sustainability through the use of clean power sources and enhancing energy security by reducing Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fuels. Wind, bio-energy and ocean energy could yield additional economic opportunities for both Irish workers and businesses. Under the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, Ireland is committed to produce at least 16% of all energy consumed from renewable sources by 2020. This will be met by 40% from renewable electricity, 12% from renewable heat, and 10% from renewable transport sector. The ambition to have 40% of electricity consumed from renewable sources by 2020 is one of the most demanding in the world. </p><p>  Looking to the longer term, my Department is participating in the low carbon road-mapping process envisaged in the planned Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill. I have published a scoping report on a low carbon roadmap for the electricity generation sector that details how my Department will pursue the development of a roadmap for the electricity generation sector to 2050.</p><p>  The SEAI publication &lsquo;Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020&rsquo; projects annual primary fuel requirement through to 2020, assuming that Ireland meets current renewable energy and energy efficiency targets set by the EU. These projections, which are available on the SEAI website, show that Ireland will remain dependent on fossil fuels in the medium term. Oil and gas will remain central to the economy, particularly in the heating and transport sectors, until affordable, secure and viable alternatives become available. In the intervening period, certain fuels, including gas, will enable the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p></reply>

This ineligibility does not apply in the case of separated persons where the alternative accommodation is occupied by a spouse, from whom the household member is separated or divorced. Under the regulations, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility and it is not necessary for the couple to be judicially separated or divorced.

Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models. To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments. Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  </p><p>  The Housing Agency is developing a strategy, in collaboration with my Department, for the utilisation of lands in its ownership which will support Government policies in developing sustainable communities. This will involve consultation with the relevant local authority and other appropriate parties. The proper management of all State land is critical; accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and local authority held lands suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any targeted social housing building programme developed in the years ahead. </p><p>  This year, it is intended that in the region of 5,000 new social housing units will be delivered across all social housing supply routes including local authority and voluntary housing construction programmes, the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the Social Housing Leasing initiative.  Earlier this year, I announced some 1,000 new social housing construction starts over the 2014-2015 period. Earlier today, I announced details of a &euro;68 million investment in new construction projects which will see some 449 new houses constructed at 56 locations around the country over the next two years. I intend to announce details of a new &euro;35 million voluntary housing construction programme early in Quarter 2 which will see some 250 special needs housing units commencing construction over the next two years. Under the national Regeneration Programme, some &euro;70 million is being invested this year in the refurbishment of houses and the construction of replacement homes. Around 350 new housing starts are anticipated up to end 2015.   </p><p>  In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587m, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. In addition, a special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses is intended to bring 400 homes back into productive use. </p><p>  The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 to review progress on our <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>, has submitted its first report to me, and this is available on my Department's website. The report considered the supply and access to housing units throughout the country, and the Government has approved the establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team and an implementation unit tasked with delivery of its recommendations.  I remain committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing.</p></reply>

However, tenants seeking to fund the purchase through loan finance from the housing authority must meet the criteria that apply to such loans, which are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012 and associated credit policy.  This policy provides that loans are not available to social welfare recipients, except where these constitute long-term Department of Social Protection payments in conjunction with a primary income of a permanent and salaried nature.  The final decision on whether or not to approve a loan in a particular case lies with the relevant housing authority, which must satisfy itself as to the borrower&rsquo;s capacity to service the loan over its full term.</p></reply>

Earlier today I announced the approval of some 56 social housing construction projects with an overall value of some &euro;68 million under the Local Authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015. This new construction programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list. Projects were selected for funding approval on the basis of the proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities, the relative priority afforded to each of these projects and the overall level of housing need locally. </p><p>  Under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) funding is provided to Approved Housing Bodies, through the local authorities, for the provision of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need, including older persons, persons with a disability and homeless persons.  In January, 2014 my Department requested local authorities to submit by 28 March, 2014 a prioritised list of new CAS projects to be progressed over the next two years. It will be a matter for local authorities to determine the relative priority of projects on the basis of their contribution to meeting local housing need and to shortlist these in order of merit. Further consideration of the CAS projects for funding approval over the next two years, including projects in County Wicklow, must await the receipt of submissions from the local authorities.</p></reply>

These changes were made on foot of the recommendations of a review group, established in 2013 by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability.</p><p>  Membership of the group included the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority personnel and my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability. The aim of the review was to spread the benefits of the schemes as widely as possible and to ensure fairness and value for money in their operation. My Department circulated a template for the revised application forms to local authorities on 7 February, 2014. It is a matter for each local authority to insert details of address, contact persons, logo etc. and to make copies of the forms available to potential applicants. There is no impediment to local authorities processing applications for the schemes.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers. </p><p>  An interdepartmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. This includes the examination of issues arising for those with specific medical conditions, which require high water usage.</p><p>  The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014. In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for a free allowance and any proposed affordability measures.   </p><p>  The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply. The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households. Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER. I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly.</p></reply>

The HAP Oversight Group is co-chaired by the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Social Protection and includes representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, City and County Managers Association and the Housing Agency.</p><p>  A Project Board is also in place to drive and oversee delivery of the project and to report to the Oversight Group.

My Department has engaged and will continue to engage as appropriate, with other stakeholders outside the governance structures outlined.  In this regard, my Department has recently provided a progress update to the Irish Council for Social Housing and Traveller representative groups, and is scheduled to meet with landlord representative groups shortly to discuss HAP and the implications for landlords.  A communications and engagement plan is being developed as part of the implementation strategy, this will provide for consultation as appropriate with stakeholders in advance of the introduction of HAP.</p><p>  My Department is working closely with key stakeholders in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to an early pilot phase and phased roll out of the scheme later in 2014, subject to the enactment of the Housing Bill providing for HAP and associated items.  Limerick local authorities have been identified as lead authority to drive implementation in the local government sector including the delivery of the early HAP pilot in 2014.  Subject to the required legislation being in place the full HAP scheme will then extend to the other 6 local authorities (Cork, South Dublin, Monaghan, Kilkenny, Louth and Waterford) identified for participation in the first phase of HAP.</p><p>  Implementation by the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin in 2015.  During implementation, it is envisaged that authorities will initially focus on taking across new applicants, before moving on a progressive basis to dealing with those already in receipt of rent supplement.  This is a reasonable approach to implementation, which will allow any issues that arise to be dealt with in a graduated way and give local authorities sufficient time to scale up the operation of HAP.</p></reply>

Since 1 March 2014, a building owner, prior to commencing work on a new building, must assign a competent builder, have the design certified by a competent registered professional and assign a competent registered professional to inspect the works during construction and, in conjunction with the builder, to certify the building on completion for compliance with the building regulations.</p><p>  Empowering competence and professionalism on construction projects in this way is an important and necessary step forward and will, I believe, greatly improve the quality of construction.  It is not the function of the local building control authority to quality assure construction projects.  Owners, builders and designers must at all times take responsibility for their statutory obligations in line with the Building Control Act 1990 and take whatever steps are necessary in order to achieve compliance in respect of the building or works concerned.</p><p>  Requirements in relation to independent verification and third party certification have not been imposed for the reasons already outlined in the reply to Question No. 528 of 18 February 2014.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the primary responsibility of owners, designers and builders to comply with the law, local building control authorities also have extensive powers under the Building Control Acts which they can and do use to enforce compliance with the Building Regulations.  These include the powers to <b>scrutinise</b> proposals and inspect works in progress; to approve, as noted, designs in respect of fire safety (Part B of the Building Regulations) and accessibility (Part M of the Building Regulations) in the case of buildings other than dwellings, to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance; to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements; and to seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.  Independence by local authorities in relation to the use of such powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts is necessary and appropriate.</p><p>  I see no inconsistency between the requirement to demonstrate by way of certificates of compliance that owners, builders and designers have fulfilled their statutory obligation to design and construct in accordance with the requirements of the Building Regulations and the use by a local authority of its powers of inspection and enforcement where reasonable and appropriate to do so. </p><p>  Enforcement activity under the Building Control Acts and the Fire Safety Act is a matter for local authorities and I have no function in relation to this aspect of the matter.  I have urged, and will continue to urge, local authorities to use all of the powers available to them to address failures to comply with statutory requirements and my Department continues to liaise closely with local authorities in this regard.</p></reply>

Water meters will be installed, where possible, at the stop valve on the public footpath or verge outside a property.  Meters are the property of Irish Water and it is illegal to tamper with a meter.  However, it will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings.</p><p>  A study commissioned by Irish Water on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections, has been recently submitted to my Department for consideration.  Any proposals for the metering of such properties would need to be considered by the Government in the first instance. </p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.   In particular, the CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plans prepared by Irish Water, and for approving codes of practice to be prepared by Irish Water.  The Act also requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water.   In discharging its functions, the CER proposes to undertake public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs during 2014.  This will include the approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the transfer of water services functions from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water.  Section 14 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that the Minister may, from time to time, designate the transfer of rights and liabilities from a water services authority to Irish Water.  This would include contracts entered into by local authorities for the provision of water services.  An Order providing for the transfer of 642 Design-Build-Operate (DBO) and capital project contracts to Irish Water was signed by me on 20 February 2014.  It was only possible to proceed with the transfer of contracts when the appropriate legislation was enacted.</p><p>  Steering Group meetings between my Department and each local authority were held on a quarterly basis during the lifetime of the Water Services Investment Programme.

This involved a key role for the existing partnership companies in that implementation.  That approach is now under active consideration by the Working Group in respect of the LEADER programme.

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years.  It is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the roll-out of a new Programme in January 2015.  Management of current contracts and Programme oversight will transfer to the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) of the Local Authorities from 1 July next.  The new Programme will be subject to the EU procurement Directive, and the competitive process for it will be open to LDCs, other not-for-profit community groups and commercial firms that can provide the services to be tendered for, to deliver the new Programme.</p><p>  All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified with the tender documentation and the contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of that assessment.  While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a procurement process, I expect, given their experience, that LDCs will apply to deliver the Programme in their areas.</p><p>  My Department has no role in the internal operations of LDCs and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage.  Each funding Department is responsible for its own funding and contractual arrangements with the LDCs.  While business continuity remains a key concern for all stakeholders it is not possible to predict what impact, if any, the outcome of the competitive process for the new Programme will have with regard to those entities, which are independent limited companies.</p></reply>

A household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  In determining whether a household has a local connection with its area, a housing authority must have regard to whether a household member:</p><p> - lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period at any time in the past;</p><p> - is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area;</p><p> - is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area;</p><p> or - has a relative (defined in the Regulations) living in the area for 2 years or longer.</p><p>  A household meeting either the residence or local connection condition may specify up to 3 areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities.  Thus, a household that applies to Dublin City Council could, if qualified for support, be entered on the waiting list of 3 of the four housing authorities in Dublin city and county.</p><p>  A qualified household that moves house within the county and city concerned remains on the waiting lists of the housing authorities for its areas of choice , provided the household continues to fulfil the relevant eligibility and needs criteria for social housing support.  Such a household does not, therefore, lose the time that it spent on waiting lists when residing at its previous address.</p><p>  A qualified household that moves to reside in another part of the State may continue to qualify for support in the county and city for the area from which it moved on the basis of its local connection with that area.  Alternatively, the housing authority managing the household&rsquo;s social support application at the time that it moved may decide, at its discretion, to retain the household on its waiting list.  However, a household that moves to another part of the State and applies for social housing support to the housing authority for its new area of residence ceases to be qualified for support in the county and city for the area in which the household no longer resides.</p></reply>

The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out by the water services authorities (which are the 34 county and city councils) in the 12 month period up to July 2014. Details of the minimum number of inspections to be carried out in each county are included in the Plan.</p><p>  An IT system, developed by the EPA for use by the water services authorities, underpins implementation of the National Inspection Plan. The system facilitates the selection of treatment systems for inspection , based on the risk to human health or the environment, and captures all information relating to inspections. This will ensure a consistent approach to inspections nationally. Implementation of the Plan is a matter for the individual water services authorities, under the supervision of the EPA. The IT system in use enables individual water services authorities to track progress in completing inspections against the Plan&rsquo;s requirements and enables the EPA to monitor the progress by all authorities.

Last month, I approved proposals by the committee for the carrying out of an exercise to get an estimate of the number and costs of new group water schemes that might have gone ahead if CL&Aacute;R funding remained in place. The results of this exercise, which is underway, are awaited.</p></reply>

The Government decision was based on estimates provided by local authorities, including those received from Mayo County Council. Requests for funding of new works to protect coastal areas have been referred to the Office for Public Works and are not covered by the Government decision of 11 February 2014.</p><p>  The Report on the Severe Weather from 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 contains details of estimates of the cost of damage caused on a county by county basis and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website ().  The arrangements for the drawing down of the funds by local authorities on foot of the Government decision were finalised following discussions between local authorities, my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  Local authorities, including Mayo County Council, have been notified of the sums being made available to them and have been requested to prioritise works which are significant for economic activity, with particular regard to the forthcoming tourist season. It is proposed to make a sum of up to &euro;6,396,900 available to Mayo County Council for a programme of repair works to roads, piers and harbours, coastal protection repairs, tourism infrastructure and other facilities which are classified as necessary community infrastructure. The sum of &euro;6,396,900 for Mayo is based on Mayo County Council&rsquo;s estimates of repair costs provided to my Department and is allocated across a number of headings, as shown in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Roads Infrastructure </th><th>Piers and Harbours </th><th>Coastal Protection Repairs </th><th>Tourism Infrastructure </th><th>Other Facilities </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council </td><td>1,620,500 </td><td>382,500 </td><td>4,205,800 </td><td>189,900 </td><td>0 </td><td>6,396,900 <br /><br /></td></tr></table>  Each Local authority has been requested to prepare and submit a programme of works for the projects identified showing the indicative timescales and drawdown profiles. These will be submitted directly to the relevant funding Departments/ Agencies. Local authorities have been informed that there will be a degree of flexibility available for prioritising projects to include works necessary as a result of more recent storms within the sub-headings of the overall funding envelope, pending preparation of more comprehensive assessment of the impacts of these recent storms. The flexibility in prioritising projects indicated above is permissible within individual programmes (e.g. roads) and not across the various programmes.</p><p>  In addition to the above funding arrangement, a once-off allocation of &euro;509,000 is being made to Mayo County Council to recoup the costs associated with the response to the storms from the period 13 Dec 2013 to 27 Jan 2014. This includes the costs of response, clean-up works and necessary immediate works which were undertaken in the aftermath of the storms. This allocation will be drawn down from my Department on provision of appropriate documentation.</p><p>  Further considerable damage has been caused by flooding and storm events that have occurred since 27 January. Details on damage caused and estimated repair costs in relation to these more recent events will be assessed when they are available.</p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years. It is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 pending implementation of   a new Programme in January 2015. Management of contracts and Programme oversight will transfer to the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) of the Local Authorities from 1 July next.</p><p>  Local Community Development Committees will be established in each local authority area over the coming months in line with the provisions in the recently enacted Local Government Reform Act 2014. These Committees will bring together both statutory and not-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas. The Committees will have responsibility for community and local development programmes funded by my Department and I am confident they will bring a strong, strategic focus to their implementation.</p><p>  This implementation will involve local development actors and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally. In the case of the LCDP and in accordance with public procurement rules, the Local Community and Development Committees will procure the programme locally. While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a procurement process, I expect, given their experience in the area, that the LDCs will apply to deliver the programme in their areas.</p><p>  The Local Community Development Committees will comprise stakeholders from local government, local development, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector and will focus on identifying the local and community development needs and priorities for their area. They will draw up Local Economic and Community Plans that will prioritise the needs of the most socially deprived communities and the means of addressing these needs, especially in the context of ensuring that programmes deliver best value for the scarce resources available at this time.  In this way, we are strengthening the operational management, oversight and planning arrangements for local and community programmes.</p></reply>

The Impact Assessment, published in tandem with the Commission Communication on a policy framework for climate and energy in the period 2020 to 2030, provides indications of where the burden would fall in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions in the event that the proposal is accepted as presented and in its entirety. The technical work by my Department is focussed on making an assessment of both the robustness and affordability of the proposal.  A definitive comparative analysis would require a breakdown of the results of the Commission&rsquo;s analysis at a level that is currently not available to Member States.</p><p>  Pending further information from the Commission on its impact assessment, the initial analysis by my Department is being carried out, using assumptions about sectoral impacts of the proposal. This on-going work points to significantly higher levels of marginal abatement cost and a larger impact on energy costs as a percentage of GDP for Ireland than estimated by the Commission. These are matters of serious concern for Ireland in terms of the overall fairness of the proposed framework, including the economic impact.</p><p>  It is important to stress that this initial analysis is based on a number of assumptions and that a further round of analysis, based on a more detailed breakdown of the Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment, may differ in nature and degree.  My Department has initiated engagement with the Commission regarding the technical analysis underpinning its Impact Assessment, to gain a clearer understanding of the analysis and further refine our own assessment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.1004.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100071#WRU01000"><p>The Government&rsquo;s 2011 Housing Policy Statement clearly outlines that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models. To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part as long term social housing supports. I am also fully committed to the principle that there should be a social housing gain from private developments. I believe that we need to strike a balance between stimulating the construction sector while capturing a proportionate social housing gain from any increased construction activity. Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  </p><p>  In July 2012, I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. In 2014 funding of over &euro;587 million is being made available across a range of housing programmes. This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. When this is taken into account funding for housing for 2014 is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.   </p><p>  With the benefit of the additional capital for new housing construction, the new social housing construction programme for 2014 - 2015 is expected to deliver close to 700 new social and voluntary homes. Earlier today, I announced a &euro;68m social housing construction programme for local authorities that will see some 56 individual projects being progressed over the 2014-2015 period and will deliver 449 new homes. I intend to announce details of the projects to be progressed by AHB&rsquo;s under the Capital Assistance Scheme as early as possible in Quarter 2, 2014. In addition, a special investment of &euro;15 million for the retrofitting of boarded-up local authority houses is intended to bring 400 homes back into productive use for persons in need of social housing.   </p><p>  The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me.  The report considered the supply and access to housing units throughout the country.  A copy of this report is available on my Department's website, </p><p>  On 25 February 2014, the Government approved the establishment of a Homelessness Policy Implementation Team and an implementation unit.  The team is tasked with implementing the Homelessness Oversight Group's First Report.  In spite of the financial constraints within which we are required to operate, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units. I am committed to continuing to develop innovative and sustainable approaches to the provision of social housing into the future.</p></reply>

My Department oversees the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS) which aims to ensure sustainable and responsible recreational use in the countryside. </p><p>  Measures to address erosion include the Walks Scheme which represents an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of many of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails. The main point of the Scheme is that it brings in the landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the trails in line with agreed work plans. The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 39 trails supported by over 1,800 landowners and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies around the country. </p><p>  A pilot Mountain Access Scheme is currently being implemented at Mount Gable in Connemara and a more extensive scheme is being developed for Carrauntuohill and the MacGillicuddy Reeks in Co. Kerry. These pilot Mountain Access projects are being progressed with a view to developing best practice in relation to sustainable trails and walking routes in the uplands. A focus of these pilots will be the management and repair of erosion and other negative consequences arising from increased activity in sensitive landscapes.   </p><p>  Restrictions on the use of bikes, motorbikes, quads etc are generally a matter for the landowner. Where trails cross State lands, this is a matter for the individual State Agencies to manage through byelaws and subsequent enforcement. In areas designated as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas or Natural Heritage Areas, I understand that use of quads, scramblers and other motor vehicles is generally proscribed by the National Parks and Wildlife Services.</p></reply>

The purpose of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) is to allow Member States to request financial aid in the event of major natural disasters.  There is a damage threshold per Member State which is set at 0.6% of GNI. The estimated costs of damage caused by the storms between 13 December 2013 and 6 January 2014 was &euro;69.5 million. The estimated costs for subsequent damage caused by severe weather from 27 January to 17 February 2014 are currently being collated but indications are that these will not exceed the costs of the damage for the 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 period. These total estimated damage costs are well below the non-negotiable GNI threshold of 0.6% (&euro;770 million in the case of Ireland) of the Solidarity Fund. </p><p>  The possibility of a regional application has also been considered. This is also subject to a series of impact criteria, including one relating to more than 50% of population of a region being directly affected by a natural disaster. Taking Munster as an example for regional designation purposes, with a population of 1.254 million it would have to be demonstrated that at least 627,000 persons were directly affected. Or, if a single county was designated as a region for the purpose of an application, and taking Galway as an example of one of the worst affected counties, 126,000 persons would have had to be directly affected. Therefore, the situations which have occurred do not appear to meet the criteria for application purposes.</p></reply>

Some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and other relevant statutory provisions.  High quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  Persons who are refused refugee status are notified of their entitlement to apply for subsidiary protection.  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.  This is invariably followed by the so-called leave to remain process. Each of these processes which determine whether an applicant can remain in the State are hugely complex and subject to oversight by the courts and have to be examined in accordance with a large body of Irish and international law. There are no shortcuts as the outcomes can lead to the most fundamental life-changing event for the applicants.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.</p><p>  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible timeframe consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.</p><p>  Legislative reform in the area of protection remains a key priority.  Work on a new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which remains part of the Government's Legislative Programme, is being advanced to enable publication later this year.  The Bill will provide,<i> inter alia</i>, for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion.</p><p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal. Direct provision provides for full board accommodation supports while a final decision is awaited by a person on their protection or any related leave to remain application.</p><p>  The operation of the Direct Provision system is kept under review and I have consistently acknowledged that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  I have no desire for applicants to remain in the protection system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  The Direct Provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State in providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State.  It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is under financial difficulty.</p><p>  The numbers of asylum seekers residing in direct provision has reduced significantly over the last five years. At the end of December, 2013 there were 4,360 residents in direct provision compared with 6,494 at the end of December, 2009. This represents a reduction of 2,134, or 33%, in the number of residents in direct provision in that period. Compared to the numbers residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), there has been a reduction of 46% or 3, 720 persons in the intervening nine years.</p><p>  A comprehensive review of the operation of the asylum seeker accommodation programme was carried out and the subsequent report -<i> &quot;Value for Money and Policy Review - Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&quot; </i> - which was published in May 2010, found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system.  No Government can afford to ignore the likely consequences of any change to the Direct Provision system.  The system cannot exist solely in its own context.  It is inextricably linked to the surrounding international protection process.  By its very nature, the processing of applications for international protection is a solemn and complex task which does not always lend itself to achieving speedy outcomes.  The time needed to determine the outcome of any legal proceedings also impacts on the length of the process.  A substantial proportion of cases in the High Court relate to judicial review proceedings taken or decisions reached in the international protection arena.</p><p>  In relation to the right to work, there are no plans to review the prohibition on the right to work for asylum seekers. Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996 provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.  The key concern in the light of past experience is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system could be undermined by giving immigrants who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum, the same access to employment as immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment. There is an effective immigration and visa system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.</p><p>  In terms of access to training, eligibility for former FAS training programmes provided through the Education and Training Boards, under the auspices of SOLAS, is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  However, it should be noted that currently asylum seekers who do not have an entitlement to work are entitled to free access to adult literacy, English language and mother culture supports only.</p></reply>

They are best placed to deal with violent offenders and to investigate offences.  </p><p>  The Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011 addresses those unfortunate situations where a householder comes face to face with a burglar and clarifies the law concerning defence of the home.  It recognises in a very practical manner the special constitutional status of an individual&rsquo;s dwelling and makes it clear that a person may use reasonable force to defend themselves in their home.  It allows for the use of such force as is reasonable in the circumstances, to protect people in the dwelling from assault, to protect property, to prevent the commission of a crime, or to make a lawful arrest.  The Act:</p><p> - extends the right to use such reasonable force to the curtilage of the dwelling;</p><p> - explicitly provides that a person attacked in the home is not required to retreat; and</p><p> - provides that a person who uses such reasonable force cannot be sued by a burglar in respect of any injury, loss or damage arising from it.</p><p>  Section 2 of the Act sets out the criteria for  use of reasonable force by a householder against an intruder entering the dwelling with criminal intent.  The householder must believe that the intruder has entered the dwelling to commit a criminal act.  The force used against the intruder must only be such as is reasonable in the circumstances as the householder believes them to be, to protect people in the dwelling from assault, to protect property, to prevent the commission of a crime or to make a lawful arrest.  Section 2(4) provides that it is a matter for a court or jury to decide whether the householder's belief with regard to the amount of force used was honestly held and provides as follows: <i>It is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held but in considering whether the person using the force honestly held the belief, the court or jury, as the case may be, shall have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for so believing and all other relevant circumstances.</i></p><p>  The Act achieves the correct balance in providing protections to the householder.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 prescribes that in any repossession proceedings concerning a borrower's principal residence, the Court may adjourn the proceedings so that a Personal Insolvency Arrangement may be explored as an alternative to repossession. This protective measure is of great importance to mortgage holders struggling under the burden of unsustainable debt. Lending institutions will not be allowed to proceed directly to the repossession stage without first engaging in good faith in the alternative measures provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.</p><p>  I understand that this is also reflected in the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which came into effect from 1 July 2013 and sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers who are facing or are already in mortgage arrears. Cooperating borrowers must now be given at least eight months, from the date arrears first arise, before legal action can commence and at the end of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) lenders will be required to provide a newly introduced three-month notice period to allow borrowers to consider their options, such as voluntary surrender or an arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, before legal action can commence.</p><p>  With regard to costs of the various debt solution processes, the application fees prescribed by the Insolvency Service of Ireland are as follows:</p><p>  - application for a Debt Relief Notice (DRN) &euro;100;</p><p>  - application for a Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) &euro;250;</p><p>  - application for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) &euro;500;</p><p>  - application fee for bankruptcy &euro;650.</p><p>  Insofar as Practitioner fees associated with the development of DSAs and PIAs are concerned, these fees will be negotiated with an individual debtor by the Personal Insolvency Practitioner in advance of a case proceeding and will be deducted from the amount of money an individual debtor is calculated as having available to pay their creditors during the term of the arrangement.</p></reply>

Details of the duration of stay by residents in asylum accommodation centres are shown in RIA's monthly reports published on its website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.</i>  The latest published report is December, 2013.  At the end of 2013, RIA was accommodating 4,360 persons, a decrease of 481 residents (10%) over 2012.  This was the 5th straight decline in a row. There has been an overall decline of 37% (2,642 persons) in the period end December 2008 to end December 2013 in the numbers being accommodated by RIA. </p><p>  The Direct Provision system facilitates the State in providing full board accommodation for those seeking protection or the right to remain in the State.  It allows the State to do so in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  There are no workable cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with associated social welfare payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' towards the State it would clearly create, the cost to the exchequer could be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.</p><p>  I remain committed to reducing the time persons spend in the direct provision system. The asylum system is in need of reform if we are to achieve this.  Work is at an advanced stage for the re-introduction to the Oireachtas of a revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. This is pursuant to the current Government policy of reform in this area, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way. </p><p>  The new legislation should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  In advance of the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing in the area of international protection, new arrangements have already been introduced for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.</p></reply>

The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.</p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children &amp;amp; Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 also sets out procedures to allow the disclosure of &ldquo;Specified information&rdquo;. This is information other than a criminal conviction record. For example, &ldquo;specified information&rdquo; could include details of offences which have been struck out, withdrawn or where the Probation Act has been applied by the court.  Such information could only be disclosed if the information provides a bona-fide reason to believe that the person would pose a threat of harm to a child or vulnerable adult. The Act also provides that a disclosure of such information must be assessed for its reliability and relevance, <i>and</i>   the disclosure must be in accordance with principles of natural justice. For example, if a person had been charged with an offence of assault or sexual assault, but the Probation Act provisions were applied, then that information could be considered for disclosure. The procedures set out in the Act are designed to ensure that the human rights of the person being vetted are adequately protected. It is important to note that before specified information can be disclosed, the person who is the subject of the information must be given a copy of that information and must be given the opportunity to challenge the proposed disclosure. The Act provides for the appointment of an independent Appeals Officer who will be responsible for assessing and deciding appeals against the proposed disclosure of specified information. The Act also provides that a decision of an Appeals Officer may be appealed to the High Court, on a point of law.</p><p>  I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in the autumn of 2014.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides ongoing support to the Revenue Customs Service and searches are regularly undertaken by the Garda&iacute; as part of intelligence-led operations led by the Revenue Customs Service.

These concerns were addressed by both the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the recent debate on the proposed legislation at the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on 21 January 2014.  I can assure the Deputy that the illicit tobacco environment will continue to be monitored closely by our law enforcement authorities. </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>   An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification. As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments. It is a matter for these Departments to determine whether any actions are required to address the issues in advance of ratification and report back to the committee. This work is ongoing in all Departments. At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>   For my Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation. The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.</p></reply>

An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  There is no legal provision to waive or reduce the applicable statutory fees in any circumstance.</p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  Every application must be assessed to establish if the statutory requirements are met.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p></reply>

The Act also sets out the duties of PIPs and AIs to debtors, creditors and the Courts.  PIPs and AIs are authorised and regulated under the Act by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  All debt resolution arrangements under the Act first have to be agreed by the debtor.</p><p>  As regards creditor consent, the Act provides for 3 types of arrangement.  The first, a Debt Relief Notice, does not require creditor approval (other than for adding an &quot;excludable debt&quot;).  This type of insolvency resolution arrangement is suitable for an insolvent debtor with very limited disposable income and assets, whose qualifying debts do not exceed 20,000 euro.  The second type, a Debt Settlement Arrangement, has to be approved by creditors representing at least 65% of the debts.  The third type, a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, has to be approved by creditors representing at least 65% of the overall debts, at least 50% of secured debt and at least 50% of unsecured debt.</p><p>  Similar creditor approval requirements apply in comparable jurisdictions.  For example, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, an individual voluntary insolvency arrangement has to be approved by creditors representing at least 75% of the overall debts.  I believe that the creditor voting rules provided in the Personal Insolvency Act follow a common-sense approach, which strikes a fair balance between debtor and creditors, while taking account of constitutional constraints.</p><p>  The Personal Insolvency legislation also gives the debtor an alternative option, as he or she may seek bankruptcy if creditors do not agree to a responsible proposal for an insolvency arrangement proposed on behalf of the debtor.  We have just reduced the term of automatic discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to 3 years.  This greatly strengthens a debtor's hand in their dealings with the banks.  If creditors refuse to engage fully and fairly with a debtor's proposals, the debtor has the option of filing for bankruptcy.  If the bankruptcy petition succeeds, any property of the debtor is transferred to the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy, and the net proceeds are paid to the creditors: when the bankruptcy is discharged (normally after 3 years) all remaining debt is written off.  This legislation will lead financial institutions to take a more realistic view of how to address issues of unsustainable debt, where substantial sums are owed and individuals are simply unable to pay them.</p></reply>

They were first issued in April 2013 and reissued in June 2013 to include changes in the Consumer Price Index.  The ISI chose a model which is a modified version of the consensual budgeting standards model originally developed in Ireland by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice backed up by over 12 years of research.</p><p>  The guidelines are intended to give a debtor protection in that they establish a minimum standard below which a debtor cannot be obliged to live.  They are based on the expenses a person necessarily incurs in achieving a reasonable standard of living defined as one which meets a person's physical, psychological and social needs.  This does not mean that a person should live at a luxury level but neither does it mean that a person should only live at subsistence level.  The guidelines were broadly welcomed by consumer and advocacy groups upon their publication.  They were seen as essential to the process of moving towards long-term restructuring measures in that they enable the debt-servicing capacity of a distressed debtor to be calculated in a fair and consistent manner so that the sustainability of repayments can be established over the course of the arrangement, be it three years or six years.</p><p>  Where an arrangement is proposed, the decision on the reasonableness or otherwise of living expenses will be a matter for debtor and creditors to determine on a case-by-case basis with the personal insolvency practitioner acting to facilitate an arrangement acceptable to both.  The guidelines on a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses strike a balance between the interests of the debtor and those of his or her creditors and so enable arrangements to be put in place which are capable of lasting the specified duration.  It is worth noting that each arrangement is subject to an annual review at which time variations to the arrangement are possible.</p><p>  I should also like to advise the Deputy that a mechanism exists for sending comments or observations on the reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses guidelines directly to the ISI by emailing: rle@isi.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Currently, there are over 4,300 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.  Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports.  The 2013 Annual Report will be published at the end of this month.  Only one centre closed in 2013 - Cliffview in Donegal - so the contract details shown in the 2012 Annual Report remain otherwise unchanged.</p><p>  In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather, it contracts in a comprehensive range of services and facilities, including accommodation, housekeeping and so on, for a fixed sum over the period of a contract.  It is a condition of contract with the RIA that the contractor has good title to the centre, but this does not specify either owning, renting or leasing the building concerned.  There is no contractual requirement for companies providing services to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department that they be registered in Ireland, although RIA understands that all contracting companies are so registered.  In certain cases, it may well be that the company concerned is unlimited or that the beneficial owners or part-owners include companies registered in off-shore jurisdictions but those are business decisions for the contractors concerned.  It is a condition of the contract that a valid Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners is provided every year.  From RIA's perspective, the critical criterion is that the contractors can fulfil the terms of their contracts with RIA.</p><p>  The registration status of a company is no prohibition to the release of information concerning payments under the relevant contract, with the proviso that details of <i>current</i> contract rates are not provided.  It is not possible to provide values for current contracts entered into by RIA.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA.</p><p>  RIA's policy on the release of contract information is that it updates the table of contracts at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously.  For example, at the end of January, 2014 the records were updated to end of December 2011.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.  RIA currently makes available on request contract details for all contracts to the end of 2011, the tables for which provide a context for the monies paid for each contract, such as the length of the contract and the number of persons for which services are contracted.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.1133.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100073#WRW01900"><p>The Direct Provision system, which system is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, is constantly evolving to take account the number of asylum seekers entering or leaving the system and, generally, to meet the aim of improving and maintaining standards.  This Government came to office on 9 March, 2011.   From then to today, the number of asylum seekers residing in direct provision asylum accommodation centres has declined from 5,975  to 4,299  i.e. a reduction of 28%.  Further, the yearly cost of the system has declined from E79.073 million in 2010 to E55.29 million in 2013- a reduction of 30%.</p><p>  In relation to inspection regimes, RIA has always had, and continues to have, three unannounced inspections of its centres every year - two by internal RIA staff and one by an external inspection company.  To ensure transparency in the system, the inspection regime changed last year.  Inspection forms were re-designed to ensure greater detail to the process, RIA staff were re-trained and all completed reports in respect of inspections which took place from 1 October, 2013, began to be published on RIA's website - www.ria.gov.ie.  The website itself was improved and re-launched in 2011.</p><p>  It is not just the inspections process that ensures the maintenance of standards.  RIA engages with service providers to ensure that, from a contractual perspective, standards are improved.  For example, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities.  Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA continues to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom/toilet facilities.  A number of centres are currently engaged in refurbishment work to ensure that families have sole access to such facilities.</p><p>  Of the 34 centres currently in the RIA portfolio, 7 are State owned i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State.  With the cooperation of RIA, the OPW began in 2013 a major refurbishment process in relation to six of these 7 centres. Work on the two 'system built' centres in  Knockalisheen, Co. Clare and Kinsale Road, Cork is continuing on a rolling 'block by block' basis and is expected to be completed this year.  In relation to the remaining four centres in Kerry, work in Atlas House Tralee is finished and work is ongoing in Johnson Marina, Tralee.  Work on Park Lodge, Killarney and Atlas House Killarney will commence later this year.  The seventh State owned centre, the mobile home campus in Athlone, whilst not undergoing the same level of refurbishment as the other six centres, is nonetheless undergoing significant ongoing maintenance work.</p><p>  In relation to information provision generally, this has improved too.  The  Asylum &amp;amp; Immigration Strategic Integration Programme (AISIP), the first ever project to address immigration related issues and transactions by taking a &quot;whole of system&quot; approach from the perspective of the client, went live in October 2011.  AISIP has allowed RIA provide more a more detailed breakdown in its Annual Reports, beginning in 2012, <font color="#000080">i</font>n relation to family profiles in each of the centres.  The Annual Reports now include full details of facilities available to children in each of the centres.  RIA also developed a new internal contracts payments database in 2013 to make payment processing and reporting easier.  RIA has also been engaged in a revision of its comprehensive Child Protection Policy the aim of which is to make it more user friendly.  The final draft document is with the Child and Family Agency for observations and once these are received the policy will be published on the RIA website and a training process will begin.</p><p>  Finally, in the next few weeks it is expected that a Sexual harassment and Domestic Violence policy will be agreed between RIA and NGO's such as AkidWa and Ruhama and the UNHCR. This policy will be implemented early in 2014.  A training programme for staff and residents will follow from agreement on this policy.  Already, in advance of this, the working group has approved an information poster which has already been distributed to all RIA centres.  These posters - available in five languages including English - provide information on accessing professional help if residents have suffered or are suffering from domestic, sexual or gender based violence or harassment.</p></reply>

Where a member of the public feels aggrieved over the level of service he or she has received from the Ombudsman Commission they may take this up with the Commission itself.

This will be the first intake of recruits to the Reserve following on from the reorganisation of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force in line with the 'Single Force Concept' whereby Reserve Units are embedded into Permanent Defence Force Formations. </p><p>  The new recruitment campaign is designed to attract enthusiastic and committed men and women from all backgrounds and ethnicities to a career in the Defence Forces.  With the changes in the makeup of Ireland's population, it is important that we raise awareness and attract recruits from all backgrounds, including the new Irish, so that our Defence Forces, Permanent and Reserve, reflect the society that they serve.  As part of the recruitment campaign the Defence Forces are contacting various groups representative of the different ethnic groups in the State.  There is also extensive engagement with schools, colleges and sports clubs and organisations.  The Defence Forces are particularly interested in attracting applications from women.  The Defence Forces is committed to full equality among all its personnel irrespective of gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. </p><p>  Applicants for recruitment to both the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force will be required to complete broadly similar assessments including physical fitness and interview assessment.  The recruitment competition for both the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force will be run through a centralised online application system on the Defence Forces website .

Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, as amended, provides that &ldquo;Any compensation which may be received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity which might be awarded under this Act to or in respect of such person and if such compensation is received after the award of any such pension or allowance the Minister may review the award and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, either terminate or reduce the amount thereof.&rdquo;  The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration compensation paid &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; for the same disablement.  Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Minister for Defence, but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.</p><p>  In April 1986 the person in question was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of a wrist injury that he sustained while serving in the PDF. The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and was awarded compensation of &euro;37,457 (&pound;29,500) by the High Court in July 1986. The annuity value of the compensation was assessed at &euro;3,648 (&pound;2,873) a year. The disability pension payable was therefore reviewed under the provisions of section 13(2) of the 1923 Act and it was decided to reduce it by the annuity value of the total compensation which he had received.</p><p>  Subsequently, the person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision to reduce the disability pension. The High Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew. A fresh review of the disability pension was accordingly undertaken.  All aspects of the case (including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors) were fully considered and in March 1988 it was decided to reduce the disability pension payable by the annuity value of the total compensation received by him. This reduction took effect from 1 April 1988. The effect of this decision was to reduce the current rate of disability pension payable from &euro;13,373.17 a year to &euro;9,725.17 a year.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the abatement of the disability pension in this case has been properly determined in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. </p></reply>

Under the Act, the two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners &ndash; one a civilian doctor and the other an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the civilian doctor are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since the Government took office.

Charges for the use of facilities and services at each of the Fishery Harbour Centres are levied by virtue of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates &amp;amp; Charges) Order 2012.  My Department is not responsible for charges levied for the use of facilities and services at other harbours throughout the country.</p><p>  With regard to the Fishery Harbour Centres, most of the charges levied on fishermen are as a direct result of fish landings. Fishermen who were unable to fish and whose vessels remained tied up in these harbours during the periods of inclement weather would not have incurred these charges in any event.  That said, I am acutely aware that the severe weather conditions experienced in recent months had an adverse effect on the fishing opportunities available to large numbers of fishermen. I have consulted with fishermen and their representatives, and been advised by them regarding possible measures to alleviate the impacts the weather has had on their activities.  </p><p>  In recognition of the limited fishing opportunities and the resultant low uptake of fish quotas in January and February, my Department met with industry representatives at the monthly meeting of the quota management advisory committee. A decision was made to increase quota levels and fishing opportunities in March to re-balance the landings and bring them more in line with expected quota uptake over the first three months. The level recommended by the industry took account of concerns not to glut the market and depress prices with very high landings in a single month. The situation will be kept under review and if necessary a similar exercise may be under taken for April quotas.</p><p>  On 12 February 2014, I informed the House that as part of its overall co-ordinated response to the impact of the recent unprecedented weather conditions, the Government had decided to allocate an additional &euro;8.8 million for the repair of the public pier, harbour and slipway network linked to fisheries and aquaculture and to allocate up to &euro;1.5 million to assist inshore fishermen in replacing lobster and shrimp pots lost or destroyed in the storms. </p><p>My Department has invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of projects which relate to the repair of public Fishery and Aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events. The closing date for applications was Friday, 28 February. The applications are currently being assessed.  BIM has also opened, for applications, a new scheme providing aid of up to &euro;2,400 for the replacement of pots lost in the storms. </p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because due to adverse weather conditions. </p></reply>

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  There is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem.  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.   </p><p>  The farming of commonages lands has a long tradition in Ireland. It is by its very nature a complex area &ndash; there are issues about the legal right to claim and there have always been disputes about the grazing of the commonages. In the vast majority of cases, however, commonage shareholders work well together on a co-operative basis to maintain the commonages in GAEC or where there is under-grazing to return the habitat to GAEC.</p><p>  My stated intention is to achieve this by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant state agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders. It will not be an easy task but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis. It is expected that this process will commence shortly.</p></reply>

All entitlements were fully used from 2005 until 2010. In 2011 the person named submitted an application to transfer 4.02 entitlements on a 7 year lease. The application was successful and the entitlements were transferred effective from 16 May 2011 to 31 December 2017.

When carrying forward the value of leased entitlements to the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, such value will be assigned to the owner of the entitlements (where the owner is eligible to participate in the Basic Payment Scheme) and not to the lessee. The value of entitlements which the person named has leased out therefore will not be lost but will be attributed to him as the owner of the entitlements. </p><p>  If the person named wishes to continue the existing lease of land and entitlements to the lessee, he may do so by way of a Private Contract Clause, presuming that he proceeds to establish entitlements in 2015 in his own name.  I recommend that the person named contact the 2015 Direct Payments Information Centre at 0761 064438 or    to discuss his individual circumstances in more detail.</p></reply>

Frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available in the Tralee office.</p><p>  The transfer of the administrative functions out of the Tralee office arises from an extensive review of the local office structure which was carried out by the Department over the last number of years.  This review concluded that, arising from investment in technology and the substantial reduction in disease levels in recent years, significant efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative functions in two centres, thereby giving rise to significant scope for redeployment of administrative staff from existing local offices.  The process of centralising the administrative functions commenced in 2012 and is on-going.</p><p>  In line with Government policy, my Department has actively sought redeployment opportunities for administrative staff in local Offices and staff have already been transferred from the local offices in Limerick, Tipperary, Enniscorthy, Waterford and Tullamore to other Departments and agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, in order to enable those bodies to provide important services, including the property tax, Garda vetting etc.  My Department will continue to maintain a public office in Tralee and, indeed, in all of the locations from which the administrative functions are being transferred.

As an indication of Government support for the sector, actions identified in Food Harvest and the subsequent Beef Activation Group Report as necessary for the development of the beef sector have been implemented. Indeed in 2014, I announced operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. Among the measures in this investment package are &euro;23m for a Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the beef sector. </p><p>  It would be unrealistic to think that the vision laid down in Food Harvest would never be challenged by market or other conditions. However, to view the significant progress made in the beef sector in recent years as a result of the commitment of Government, farmers and other stakeholders, through the prism of the current market difficulties alone, would, in my view, do a disservice to all of the stakeholders in this critically important sector. The principles laid down in Food Harvest constitute a vision for the sector which I am confident remains valid, despite the current price and specification difficulties. I am committed to ensuring that the measures announced this year, and the new Rural Development Programme, provide the tools to enable beef farmers to reduce costs and improve profitability and to make their enterprises more sustainable. </p><p>  In relation to the current difficulties between farmers and processors, the Deputy will appreciate that ultimately questions of price and market specification are matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly on these issues. Nonetheless I recently met farmer representatives and processors to discuss the current situation. Following that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each of their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain and to address supply chain issues in such a context. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p></reply>

The Irish Coursing Club is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.  Alongside its function of maintaining the Irish Greyhound Stud Book the Irish Coursing Club has also the main function of the regulation of coursing.</p><p>  The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon. The ICC has assured my Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing.  </p><p>  Regarding the supervision of coursing events the ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  </p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of hares and greyhounds alike.</p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012/2013 season.  Against this background as outlined, I have no plans to change the current arrangements for greyhound registrations.</p></reply>

I am aware that the Commission has encouraged Member States to make use of article 33c to contribute to mutual funds established by fishermen to assist fishermen with economic losses caused by adverse climatic events.  However, distribution of the EMFF funds amongst Member States has not yet been determined by the EU Commission and pending that, Ireland has been allocated no specific funding under the EMFF at this point.  </p><p>  My Department is working to prepare a new 7-year Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  Work on that Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and the allocation of funds by the Commission, so given the likely adoption date of June, the Programme is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  Decisions on what to do with the finite resources available to Ireland under that Operational Programme will be a key element of that work and I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile alternative investment priorities.

Among the measures in this investment package are &euro;23m for a Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p><p>  In addition suckler farmers will benefit from the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which was agreed under the Irish Presidency last year. Under Pillar I suckler farmers will continue to receive an annual direct single farm payment and under Pillar II there will be a new Rural Development Programme (RDP). As yet no final decisions have yet been made on the measures to be included in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 but it will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas. </p><p>  I recently published a consultation document on the new RDP, which sets out a range of proposed measures for inclusion. The main areas proposed for support for the beef sector are:</p><p>-   a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>-   continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year,</p><p>-   incentives for on-farm capital investment, </p><p>-   knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, including the beef sector, </p><p>-   a beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd,  and</p><p>-   other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming, etc.</p><p>  Primary producers in the beef sector will be able to apply for any or all of these measures over the lifetime of the programme, as suits their particular enterprise, once the draft RDP has been approved. In keeping with the timelines agreed at EU level, it is intended to submit a draft of the new RDP to the European Commission in the second quarter of 2014. This draft will then form the basis for detailed discussions over a number of months with the European Commission.</p></reply>

A new scheme, known as the Single Payment Scheme, replaced those schemes from that date. The gross Single Payment is based on the average number of animals, and/or the average number of hectares in the case of Arable Aid, on which payments were made in the three reference years, 2000, 2001 and 2002.  The above named received 59.90 Standard entitlements @ &euro;107.29 with a total net value of &euro;6,426.67 in 2005 through a transfer. In 2005 he submitted applications under Force Majeure, New Entrant and National Reserve, however he was unsuccessful under each category as he did not meet the required criteria.</p><p>  The Single Payment Scheme will cease on 31 December 2014 and will be replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme. While initially retaining the link with the Single Payment Scheme, the model of convergence that will be implemented in Ireland will gradually move all farmers towards a national average value over the five years of the new scheme. Under this model all farmers are guaranteed that they will achieve a minimum value of at least 60% of the national average by 2019. The purpose of this model is to achieve a gradual phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements. It will I believe introduce a fairer more equitable distribution of funds between farmers while avoiding the negative impact of a sudden move to a &lsquo;flat-rate&rsquo;.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-11a.1288.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014031100076#WRZ01300"><p>In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general this group holds low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme.</p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme. The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision the group of farmers who receive the Grassland Sheep Scheme will have the immediate benefit of an additional &euro;10.3 million in 2015 as part of their payment under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p><p>  Over the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised and while the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that for the third consecutive year Irish sheep throughput grew, reaching 2.61 million head, a rise of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach &euro;220m. </p><p>  I have recently announced details in relation to the measures proposed for inclusion in the new Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020.  These proposed measures form the basis for a public consultation in relation to the new RDP, and written submissions have been invited by 19 February.  Details in relation to the consultation process and the proposed measures for the new RDP can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The consultation process will inform the next stage of RDP design, including the detailed development of new schemes.</p></reply>

Under these provisions, arable farmers whose holdings include more than 15 hectares of arable land must ensure that at least 5% of that arable land is allocated to Ecological Focus Area. All arable farmers with less than 15 hectares are exempt from the EFA requirement. </p><p>  There are, of course, a number of further exemptions whereby farmers will be exempt from Crop Diversification and EFA greening measures. The following categories of farmers are the most significant for Irish farmers:</p><p>-   Where more than 75% of the eligible land of the holding is permanent grassland, used for production of grasses or other herbaceous forage or a combination of these, provided the arable area not covered by these uses does not exceed 30 hectares.</p><p>-   Where more than 75% of the arable land of a holding is used for the production of grasses or other herbaceous forage or land laying fallow, or a combination of these, provided the remaining arable area does not exceed 30 hectares.</p><p>-   Land that is subject to organic farming practices automatically fulfils all greening requirements. However such exemption only applies to that part of the holding which is farmed organically.</p><p>  The following areas can be classified as EFA areas under the EU Regulations:</p><p>- Lands lying fallow;</p><p>- Landscape features such as hedges, ditches and drains &ndash; including those situated adjacent to arable land;</p><p>- Buffer Strips; </p><p>- Short Rotation Coppice &ndash; no use of mineral fertiliser and/or plant protection products</p><p>- Eligible SPS Afforested Areas;</p><p>- Areas of catch crops or green cover;</p><p>- Areas of nitrogen fixing crops;</p><p>- Field margins &ndash; no agricultural production;</p><p>- Ponds &ndash; maximum of 0.1 ha</p><p>- Traditional stonewalls.</p><p>  With the exception of buffer strips which may also be situated on permanent grassland, and afforested areas/short rotation coppice, the EFA areas referred to above must be situated on arable lands. Arable lands are lands that were involved in crop rotation in one or more years during the previous five years. In relation to the areas referred to by the Deputy, I assume that the lands with tree cover and scrub are not arable lands and are, therefore, not eligible as an EFA area. The grazing part of such areas are eligible for payment under the Single Farm Payment and under the Basic Payment Scheme (from 2015) provided they are farmed by the applicant and maintained in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition. However, hedgerows, as already stated can be eligible as an EFA area provided they are situated in or adjacent to an arable parcel declared by the applicant.</p></reply>

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Educational Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency. </p><p>  Within the Child and Family Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service (EWS) has specific responsibility for the Agency&rsquo;s general function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Agency has advised me that the total number of Educational Welfare Officers in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014 are as follows: <table><tr><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 to date</th></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>57</td><td>59</td><td>58</td></tr></table>  In addition to these posts, there are 12 Senior Educational Welfare Officers and 3 Regional Managers employed nationally. The Agency has advised me that the Dublin 3, Dublin 5, and Dublin 17 postal districts do not have the services of an assigned Educational Welfare Officer at this time. To ensure continuity of service and a targeted approach to areas and cases of greatest need, all locations where an Educational Welfare Officer is not assigned or where a leave event exists receive a service provided by the Senior Educational Welfare Officer, responding to the most critical situations where children are out of school or have no place. The Agency has advised me that Dublin 13 area has an assigned officer who will be returning in April 2014.

This additional funding will assist the new Child and Family Agency in meeting identified service pressures.  This will include the filling of social work vacancies taking account of identified need, with a particular focus this year on the filling of vacancies arising from maternity leave. </p><p>  The Agency is also finalising proposals arising from the provision of this additional funding, for the targeted recruitment of graduate social workers.  This initiative will involve the introduction of a guaranteed and protected induction programme for newly qualified social workers.  Discussions with IMPACT and other parties are ongoing and the merits of the scheme will be clear when the details are finalised.  </p><p>  It is my view that the scheme will not discriminate against new graduates as it is being designed to create a stable and protected initial environment within which newly qualified graduate social workers can hone their skills in practice. The scheme will include protected workload as well as weekly tutorial and mentoring provision and therefore does not constitute equal workloads to that of staff who are   social workers with more experience and have a larger number of caseloads to manage.</p><p>  Full details of the scheme will be published after discussions with the trade unions have been completed.</p></reply>

The meeting of the 22nd October 2013 was very positive and detailed discussions took place between the Russian officials and officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the  HSE.  At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department, in early November 2013, forwarded to the Russian side further detailed proposals based on the discussions which took place.  Following this my Department prepared revised draft wording on a number of specific points which were recently forwarded to the Russian Authorities.  In transmitting these revisions to the Russian authorities it was suggested that should these revisions be acceptable to the Russian Federation, it would be useful for both sides to meet again for further discussions.</p></reply>

As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill.  A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues.  One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy.  I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution.  This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill.  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  </p><p>  I am not in a position to give a comprehensive account of the provisions of the proposed legislation until the Heads of Bill have been agreed by Government.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.  The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested parties.  In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound.</p></reply>

However, it should be emphasised that the vast majority of EU patients receive healthcare in their own country and prefer to do so.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the necessary statutory provisions to fully implement the Directive and will have them in place as soon as possible.</p><p>  Nevertheless, there are arrangements in place in respect of the key provision of the Directive in relation to a national contact point (NCP), which has been set up within the HSE and will administer the information and reimbursement aspects of the Directive.  The principal function of the NCP is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost, the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the rights, if any, that they may have through the legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP will be able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State.</p><p>  The Directive allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU member states that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, and which is not contrary to Irish legislation. The costs must be born by the individual and he/she then seeks reimbursement for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.  Costs will only be reimbursed up to the level that would have been arisen if the healthcare had been provided in Ireland or the actual cost of the healthcare in the other member state, whichever is the lesser. Where the medical treatment being sought is not available in Ireland, patients may, as at present, apply for the Treatment Abroad Scheme operated by the HSE under EU Regulation 883/04.</p></reply>

As a result, the nursing resource in Letterkenny General Hospital will be restructured, delivering benefits to both children and adults with Diabetes. The current resource of  two Clinical Nurse Specialist posts and one Staff Nurse post in the Diabetic service at Letterkenny General Hospital will remain unchanged. One of the two hospital Clinical Nurse Specialist posts will have a focus on children with diabetes and the other will have a focus on adults with diabetes. The existing midwifery allocation to support pregnant women with diabetes will also continue unchanged.</p><p>  The new post of Integrated Diabetes Clinical Nurse Specialist is an additional resource which will link hospital-based diabetic services to community-based diabetic care services.  This role is an essential resource in empowering patients to achieve optimum diabetes control by utilising clinically sound collaborative links between primary care and secondary care providers, as envisaged in the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme developed by the National Clinical Programme for Diabetes.</p><p>  The outcome of these changes will be that nursing support for children with diabetes within the hospital will remain at current levels. Overall services will be enhanced through the support of the Integrated Services Clinical Nurse Specialist, who will work across both the hospital and the community.  In addition to the enhanced nursing resources outlined above, the hospital is in the process of recruiting permanent Consultants to two vacant posts within the Paediatric service. One of these posts is being advertised as a Consultant Paediatrician with a Special Interest in Diabetes. In the interim, Consultant cover for children with diabetes is currently being provided by a locum Consultant Paediatrician.</p></reply>

There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines supplied under the community drug schemes since the mid 1990s. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.</p><p>  Price increases have only been allowed under the national pricing agreements in exceptional circumstances.  Approximately 60 products have been granted price increases since 2006. Included in this are essential medicines such as epilepsy medicines and cortico-steroids. Price increases are only allowed <i>in extremis</i> to maintain supplies of required medicines in the Irish market and require the provision of detailed supporting evidence including international pricing.</p><p>  In relation to hydrocortisone, it is appreciated that for an individual patient, the increase in its price is substantial. However, if an increase had not been agreed, the manufacturer was insistent that it would remove the product from the Irish market. If that had occurred, patients would have had to pay for an even more expensive unlicensed product. There is still only a single supplier of hydrocortisone in the Irish market, which suggests that the HSE made the right decision in allowing the price increase in order to maintain supply.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.</p><p>  As the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, there is no standardised national application procedure in place.  However, it works at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done in a number of ways such as by providing grant-aid to support pre-school provision in community pre-schools and by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases at local level disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible.</p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  However, there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team has been set up to examine the issues around the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, building on previous analysis in this area.  Representatives of the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and of the City and County Childcare Committees are members of this group and it is chaired by the Department of Health.  The issue of supports for children with disabilities in mainstream pre-school settings is being looked by this sub-group.</p></reply>

Of these, 295,815 are waiting less than 12 months, a level of 98.4% compliance with the Government target of 12 months.</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 12-24 months have reduced by 94%, from 67,529 down to 3,990</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 24-36 months have reduced by 97%, from 23,726 down to 706</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 36-48 months have reduced by 97%, from 7,802 down to 197</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 48+ months have reduced by 99%, from 7,795 down to 44</p><p>  Of course, referrals for first time appointments are only one part of the activity taking place in Outpatient clinics.  In 2013 the 736,960 new referrals seen by consultants accounted for approximately 30% of their total Outpatient workload: a further 1,720,850 return appointments brought the full number of attendances at Outpatient clinics to 2,457,810.  A key part of the management of  outpatient waiting lists, is addressing the loss of 16% of the total potential outpatient capacity due to patients not attending scheduled outpatient appointments (often referred to as the &lsquo;Do Not Attend&rsquo; or &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; rate). Through the introduction of validation of current waiting lists, revised control processes in respect of patients who fail to attend booked appointments, using texts and/or letters to prompt patients about forthcoming appointments, facilitating patient choice in the arrangement of appointments and the use of electronic referral systems, it is intended to reduce the &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; rate to 10% in 2014.</p><p>  Finally, it should be borne in mind that a patient's first point of call should always be to their GP, rather than seeking direct self-referral or referral from another source, as the patient's GP is most likely to have a greater knowledge of their previous medical history, current co-morbidities and other factors which may be essential to the consultant in order to provide the most appropriate and effective care.</p></reply>

The aim is to provide up to 95% of health and social care in local communities and this will be achieved by increasing activity in the primary care setting and the redirecting of services away from acute hospitals to the community.</p><p>  The Government has planned to implement the following key measures in primary care during its term in office and significant progress has already been made in these areas: </p><p>-   Introduction of a universal GP service free at the point of access;</p><p>-   Introduction of a new GP contract;</p><p>-   Phased roll out of chronic disease management programmes;</p><p>-   Expansion of the primary care workforce; and</p><p>-   Continued development of the primary care infrastructure.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the implementation of the above key measures will play a significant part in the re-focussing of health services in line with the Government's health reform programme and consequently, ensuring that more patients are treated in the community, reducing unnecessary hospital appointments.</p><p>  In relation to waiting times for public patients to see consultants, a maximum waiting time target of 12 months has been set for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE's National Service Plan.  The National Waiting List Management Policy, &quot;A Standardised Approach to Managing Scheduled Care Treatment for In-Patient, Day Case and Planned Procedures, January 2013&quot;, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>  With regard to arrangements for the referral of private patients to consultants, neither my Department nor the HSE have any function in the matter.</p></reply>

Smoking cessation is a key goal if we are to meet that target.  Treating tobacco addiction as a care issue is a critical principle underpinning Tobacco Free Ireland.  The appropriate management of tobacco addiction can significantly reduce the burden of chronic disease on individuals, their families and the healthcare services.</p><p>  The HSE is responsible for the provision of smoking cessation services, and as such the Deputy's question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.

The Authority will review the governance arrangements of pre-hospital emergency care services to ensure the timely assessment, diagnosis, initial management and transport of an acutely ill patient to an appropriate healthcare facility, but may not necessarily focus on any particular geographic area or any specific incident.  Planning for the review has now commenced and HIQA is currently in the process of designing an assessment framework against the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  The Authority will report on the findings and issue recommendations as soon as the review is completed.  In addition to the HIQA review of governance, the National Ambulance Service will undertake a capacity review, to determine current and future service delivery needs.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  Under the legislation, there is no (and has never been an) automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with  any specific condition or  illness.  While there is no legal basis for the HSE to award medical cards on the basis of a specific medical condition, the HSE has, however, discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances.  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds, set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances (medical or social), which might result in undue financial hardship in the arranging of medical services.  Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot arrange GP services for themselves and their family without undue financial hardship.</p><p>  Discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of undue hardship in arranging a GP service, having regard to his or her means.  Undue hardship can only be ascertained through an assessment of financial means, with the extra discretionary effect where a person's condition or illness is affecting his/her financial situation.  The HSE must operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.</p></reply>

Generally speaking, persons at known risk of anaphylaxis would be well advised to carry an adrenaline pen and, in the case of children, carers and teachers should be made aware of the child&rsquo;s condition and have access to, and be shown how to use an adrenaline pen in an emergency.

The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine (Fampyra&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website ().  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.

Of these, 295,815 are waiting less than 12 months, a level of 98.4% compliance with the Government target.</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 12-24 months have reduced by 94%, from 67,529 down to 3,990</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 24-36 months have reduced by 97%, from 23,726 down to 706</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 36-48 months have reduced by 97%, from 7,802 down to 197</p><p>  - Numbers waiting 48+ months have reduced by 99%, from 7,795 down to 44.</p><p>  A key part of the management of scheduled care, and in particular outpatient waiting lists, is addressing the loss of 16% of the total potential outpatient capacity due to patients not attending scheduled outpatient appointments (often referred to as the &lsquo;Do Not Attend&rsquo; or &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; rate). Through the introduction of validation of current waiting lists, revised control processes in respect of patients who fail to attend booked appointments, using texts and/or letters to prompt patients about forthcoming appointments, facilitating patient choice in the arrangement of appointments and the use of electronic referral systems, it is intended to reduce the &lsquo;DNA&rsquo; rate to 10% in 2014.</p><p>  As regards Inpatient / Day Case care, the total number of adults waiting more than eight months for an inpatient or day-case procedure at 31 December 2013 was 68. This, compared with a figure of 2752 at the end of 2012, is a comparative reduction of 97.7%.  If compared with the figure of 7,645 identified in August 2011, the comparative reduction exceeds 99%.  Of a total of 1,731 children awaiting inpatient / day case surgery, over 91% are waiting less than 20 weeks, with approximately 170 children in breach of the target as at 31 December 2013. Those who have exceeded the target are predominantly awaiting spinal surgery in Crumlin or ENT evaluation in Temple St.  It is anticipated that the appointment of a new Consultant and supporting team in Crumlin will increase the capacity for spinal surgery by 50 &ndash; 75 cases annually, which will facilitate the achievement of the 20 week target; in terms of ENT, the current shortfall is to be addressed through a combination of outsourcing across a number of appropriate sites and securing additional consultant capacity.</p><p>  In respect of GI Endoscopy, over 99% of patients waiting for routine endoscopy procedures are waiting less than 13 weeks. As at 31 December 2013, 73 patients were waiting over 3 months, thereby exceeding the 13 week target:  plans have been drawn up to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 13 weeks in 2014.  This will be achieved by opening additional endoscopy units, focusing on more robust levels of control of the GI Endoscopy programme and the use of periodic outsourcing where necessary, to increase capacity within the system.  All of these measures will enable the HSE to regain and maintain compliance with the 13 week target.</p><p>  The HSE Service plan includes a specific &euro;30 million fund to address hospital service pressures and every effort will be used to deploy this fund as effectively as possible to achieve and surpass service plan activity targets.   In order to ensure that patients who require emergency, acute or elective care can access that care,  the HSE is also seeking to maximise the discharge options available to patients who no longer require such care by opening additional sub-acute beds, where such capacity is available and providing additional home care supports so that as many older people as possible can be supported at home.  These measures will help to expedite the discharge of patients whilst ensuring they continue to receive the care appropriate to their needs, thus reducing delayed discharges further, easing ED trolley waits and reducing the risk of cancellation of elective procedures.</p></reply>

Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in additional price reductions being agreed. From 1 April 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay for generic products will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% currently to approximately 20%.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 introduced a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 resulting in a 70% reduction in the price paid by the HSE for these products since May 2013. Reference prices for esomeprazole 20mg products and esomeprazole 40mg products were implemented on 1 January 2014 and 1 February 2014, respectively, resulting in price reductions of 56% respectively compared to May 2013 price.  Reference prices were also set for rosuvastatin products with effect from 1 February 2014 resulting in a 40% reduction in the prices paid for these products. </p><p>  With effect from 1 March 2014, the HSE implemented reference prices for a further four groups of interchangeable medicines - Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Pravastatin - resulting in substantial reductions in the prices the HSE pays for these products. The reference prices are published on the HSE website at .</p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to four more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Lercanidipine, Pantaprazole, Ramipril and Quetiapine. It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 April 2014. The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation. It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end Quarter 1 2015. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p><p>  In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland. However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  However, I would be disappointed if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients.  The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website, plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. </p><p>  Finally, my Department has asked the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (the pharmacy regulator) to consider how to provide greater price transparency in retail pharmacies. This examination is ongoing.</p></reply>

Under the Act. the system of statutory registration comprises a registration board for each of the twelve designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters. To date, five registration boards are operational and it is expected that the registration boards and their registers for the remaining seven designated professions should be established by the end of 2015.</p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 also provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.  Whilst the immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the twelve professions currently designated under the Act,  I am committed to bringing counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.</p><p>  A number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups have come together as the Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice for the professions in so far as is possible.  However, a number of issues remain to be clarified.  These include decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists.  In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession. In addition, the standards of proficiency to be required of existing practitioners for registration will need to be established and the necessary qualifications prescribed. QQI produced a draft Report to which my Department furnished a response in November 2013.</p><p>  My Department will closely study the final QQI report as soon as it is available and will then engage with relevant stake holders in order to work through the outstanding issues with a view to achieving regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists as soon as possible in the best interests of the protection of the public.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 years and under with access to a GP service without fees.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation, which I expect to be published shortly.  A draft contract for the provision of free GP care to children aged 5 years and under, is currently the subject of a consultation process.  I would wish to emphasise that the document is a draft and I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text following the consultation process.</p><p>  The Deputies' questions raised a number of specific issues, which I will now address. </p><p>  The obligations set out in the draft contract in respect to the inspection of records by the HSE is a standard feature of most contracts for the provision of  health and social services on behalf of the HSE.  Among the circumstances in which they might need to be invoked would be where patient safety concerns arise; where concerns exist about the quality of services being provided; in processing complaints from patients/relatives; and for probity assurance purposes.  In exercising a provision of this nature, the HSE would be obliged to have due regard to patient confidentiality considerations, the need for patient consent and applicable legislative obligations.</p><p>  In relation to the limitation on the number of patients on a GPs list, a similar provision is included in the existing General Medical Services (GMS) contract.  </p><p>  Regarding visitation rates, research carried out for the Department in 2013 indicates that fee-paying children under 6 years of age have an annual GP visit rate of 2.7, whereas, medical card/GP visit card holding children in the same age cohort have an annual visitation rate of 3.1.  </p><p>  The term &quot;<i>medical practitioner</i>  &quot; rather than &quot;doctor&quot; is used throughout the existing GMS contract and throughout the draft contract for the provision of GP care for children under six years.  </p><p>  I expect that issues such as increased visitation rates, the capacity of the existing number of doctors to deliver the service and the proposed five year contract will be the subject of further discussions with the GP's.</p></reply>

Patients, family caregivers and health care providers all play vital roles in maintaining a patient's health after discharge, from whatever type of care facility. Effective discharge planning  is designed to help recovery, ensure that medications are properly prescribed and correctly given, assist in responsibility for caring,  and reduce the chances that a relative is re-admitted to care. Every effort is made by the Department and the HSE to ensure that these principles are reflected in relevant health legislation, policies and operational guidance documents, and carried through in the type of care provided by individual facilities to each patient.  Regulated health professionals adhere to codes of conduct which set out frameworks and guidelines of professional and ethical standards across a range of practices, including communicating with patients and their families on all aspects of treatment. These codes are revised at regular intervals.  </p><p>  In relation to acute care, the HSE National Integrated Care Guidance (2014) has been developed by the National Integrated Care Advisory Group under the auspices of the Quality and Patient Safety Division. The guidance is based on feedback received following extensive national and targeted consultation with service providers in both the acute and community healthcare settings, and on review of the HSE Integrated Discharge Planning Code of Practice (2008). This practical guide to integrated care is designed to support healthcare providers to improve their discharge and transfer processes from the acute hospital setting back into the community.  This guide will support service providers in demonstrating how they are meeting the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, and outlines nine key steps in effective discharge and transfer of care which will facilitate faster, safer discharges for patients.    </p><p>  In relation to psychiatric services, in 2009 the Mental Health Commission published a <i>Code of Practice on Admission, Transfer and Discharge to and from an Approved Centre,</i>  pursuant to Section 33(3) (e) of the Mental Health Act 2001. The code of practice is relevant to all partners involved in the delivery of mental health care and treatment. The Commission has also developed a similar guide for service users, carers and advocates. A primary aim of  Mental Health Commission  publications is to create a more positive approach to recovery for service users through in-patient mental health services, by improving the continuity and co-ordination of care and treatment provided. </p><p>  The national policy document, '<i>A Vision for Change</i>  ', recognises the vital role played by family members in the recovery process, which is accepted and supported by mental health professionals. It is acknowledged that patient outcomes are better where families and/or carers are involved, and healthcare professionals should actively encourage patients at all stages to involve their family and/or carer in the development of the patients care and treatment plan. However, it is also acknowledged that patient confidentiality should not be compromised and, in some cases, patients specifically request that contact is not made with families. If this confidence was breached, it could damage the health professional/patient relationship. The Medical Council's Ethical Guide does, however, allow a doctor to ethically breach confidentiality if, for example, he/she believes that the patient is at-risk of harming himself/herself or others. </p><p>  I have asked the Expert Group, which is currently reviewing the Mental Health Act 2001, to specifically consider the broader issue of whether mental health legislation should be amended to require health professionals to consult with the family of persons with mental health problems. The Expert Group is also expected to report on a range of other issues, including discharge planning from approved centres.

Competencies are developed and agreed in conjunction with relevant Boards, depending on their requirements.  The suitability of applicants is assessed against these criteria and a short-list is compiled from which I may make appointments.  Appointments may not necessarily be from one of the applications received through the advertising process, which is also in line with the Government Decisions.</p><p>  I welcome one of the main findings of the Merc Partners survey,  which showed that 80% of the those involved in the research would be happy to put themselves forward for a position on a State board.  Boards need a broad range of competencies in order to function effectively and it good to know that there is such enthusiasm among the private sector to contribute to public sector boards.  To date my Department has posted over 30 notices for expressions of interest to State boards on its website or through the Public Appointments Service and this process will continue as a way of ensuring the best mix of skills and experience both from public and private sectors is available to our Boards.  I am confident that the appointments made by me are contributing in a meaningful way to the important work undertaken by the various State bodies under the aegis of this Department.</p></reply>

The resolution of the funding difficulties in the scheme, which has a substantial and unsustainable deficit of over &euro;700 million, is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the regulator of such pension schemes - the Pensions Board.  The trustees have recently announced that they have decided in principle on a number of changes to address the funding difficulties.  The trustees, who are central to any solution to the funding difficulties, are required by law to act in the best interests of all members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members.</p></reply>

I intend to commence most of its provisions from the beginning of April.  Specifically, I am planning to commence sections 3-5, 7-9, and 14-26.  This will include most of the new driver licensing provisions, with the exception of section 6 which provides for the recording of accompanied driving experience in a logbook before learners make take the driving test.  Regulations will be required setting out the specific requirements of the logbook before section 6 can be commenced.  My Department is currently liaising with the Road Safety Authority regarding the drafting of the necessary Regulations.</p><p>  With regard to sections10-13, these include the new penalty points provisions, and the new measures to deal with intoxicated driving.  It is necessary to ensure that all of the appropriate administrative and technical issues have been addressed in the relevant organisations - the Road Safety Authority, National Vehicle Driver File, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - before these sections are commenced.  My Department is in discussion with the organisations involved in this regard and, while  I cannot provide the Deputy with a precise date for commencement of these sections, I intend it to be at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

During Ireland&rsquo;s term as Presidency of the European Council in the first half of 2013, the Road Safety Authority chaired the Working Group meetings at which this proposal was progressed.  Early in the discussions, Ireland made a submission that hybrid and electric vehicles would require the mandatory fitment of AVAS.  Other Member States were supportive of these proposals and by the end of the Irish Presidency a consensus was achieved which requires vehicle manufacturers to install AVAS in new types of vehicles within four years and then to all new vehicles within six years.  Once consideration of the proposal has been completed at official level, it will go to the Council of Ministers, where the mandatory measures for AVAS will receive my support.  Based on the progress being made so far, it is anticipated that a formal EU Regulation on vehicle noise will be adopted before the end of this year.</p></reply>
