I also announced that a process has been put in place by Tusla to manage these cases.  This is being led by experienced information and tracing social workers.</p><p>As an immediate step Tusla put in place a Helpline which is operating from 10am to 4 pm Monday to Friday.  Tusla has also put  relevant information on its website.</p><p>Each of the 126 cases has been assigned to a social worker and work has commenced on tracing the people concerned.  These include the person who was illegally registered as a child, the birth mother and the people who participated in the illegal registration and subsequently raised these children as their own.</p><p>The majority of the files containing information are more than 50 years old.  The implication of this is of course, that the information in the files is over 50 years old.  Some of the information was deliberately falsified.  People have changed addresses.  Some have emigrated.  Many are no longer alive. </p><p>Each file is being examined.  Information is being checked and updated where possible.  Some files will be more difficult to update than others but strenuous efforts are being made on every file.</p><p>The process of offering contact and support to those affected will be handled very carefully.  It will take account of each individual&rsquo;s requirements.  Some people may not wish to have any contact.  Others may wish to take their time in engaging.  I expect that there are others who may accept contact and support at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Offers of contact and support will begin at the end of the month in cases where there is sufficient information available to establish contact.</p><p>My focus in the first instance is the provision of information and support.  People have a right to their identity.  They have a right to honest answers and we have a duty to provide this if possible.</p><p>The question of redress does not arise at this point in the process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-13a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018061300071#WRC00400"><p>I welcome the publication of the latest report of the Child Care Law Reporting Project, which deals with lengthy, contested and complex child protection cases in the District Court.</p><p>The report&rsquo;s author, Dr Carol Coulter, notes that the issues raised cannot be solved by one branch of Government alone.  They require co-ordinated action from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, the legal profession, Tusla, and my own Department. </p><p>The Recommendations include: the need for Tusla to try too identify potentially complicated cases early on , and to develop a strategy to deal with them; the need for a unified national legal strategy in child protection cases; and the provision of national training for social worker to help strengthen their analytical abilities relating to legal issues. </p><p>I have been assured by Tusla that all of the recommendations are being given full consideration by senior management.  A number of ongoing reforms will address the key recommendation for better awareness of complex cases at all management levels.</p><p>Tusla has also informed me that Signs of Safety and the Empowering Practice and Practitioner Initiative are being rolled out.  It is anticipated that this will help to reduce the number of protracted court processes by requiring social workers to proactively work with families towards a solution, before considering an intervention. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla are working with the Garda&iacute; to develop and implement joint protocols on data sharing, specialist interviewing, and the investigation of child sex abuse.  This, it is hoped, will increase efficiencies and reduce delays in finalising these cases.</p><p>I  also plan to develop an Irish approach to the Barnahus and Child Advocacy Centre models for services to children who have suffered sexual abuse.  The centres to be established will support children who have suffered sexual abuse in a way that would minimise their trauma while accessing protective, therapeutic or health services, and engaging with the criminal justice system. </p><p>The first meeting of the Cross Agency Interdepartmental group, which I established together with my colleagues Minister for Justice and Equality and Minster for Health, to examine the development of an Irish model for children who suffered child sexual abuse, was held in February 2018.  The Group is working towards establishing dedicated Cross Agency centres for these children, in line with best international practice and standards.  The Group continues to meet regularly to progress this work.</p><p>The Child Care Law Reporting Project was established to bring transparency to child care proceedings, and to collect information that will assist in the better operation of the Child Care Act 1991. </p><p>The Report, and the recent submission from Dr Coulter, will assist my Department in the review of this Act, and its findings will help ensure that any new child protection and welfare legislation will work for the benefit of our most vulnerable children.</p><p>Finally, I am delighted to confirm that the Project will be funded by my Department for another three years.  I look forward to more concise and empirical research on this very important topic.</p></reply>

When an inspection is carried out by HIQA, the process requires the service inspected to develop an Action Plan in response to the findings made by Inspectors.  </p><p>This Action Plan is agreed with HIQA in advance of the publication of the report.  All elements of the Action Plans are time-bound, and a designated Tusla official is responsible for executing the Plan.</p><p>HIQA undertakes follow-up inspections to examine the progress being made against Action Plans. </p><p>In 2017, HIQA carried out themed inspections across the 17 Tusla areas, in the area of foster care.  The inspections assessed the recruitment, assessment, approval, supervision and review of foster carers and inspected against eight of the 27 Standards in Foster Care. </p><p>A number of positive findings were reported. Assessments of foster carers were of good quality, as were supports for foster carers caring for children with complex needs, and reviews of ongoing placements.  Families with allocated link workers were satisfied with the quality of the service and support they received.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that County Tipperary falls within two of the Tusla regions - the MidWest, and the region of Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary. </p><p>HIQA published inspection reports for these regions in August and October 2017, respectively. </p><p>HIQA found that aspects of the standards were not met in both areas.  The clear themes coming through were the need for better oversight by the Foster Care Committee, how the overall system is working, management of complaints and allegations, recruitment of staff, the replenishment and broadening of foster care panels, improved supports and supervision of foster carers. </p><p>By and large children in foster care do well and that is in large part due to the dedication of the foster carers, supported by their social work team.  However, HIQA raises some consistent and worrying concerns.  I, and my officials, are actively engaging with Tusla with a view to addressing the findings in HIQA reports and delivering the best possible service to children in foster care. </p><p>I am pleased to note that HIQA accepted Tusla&rsquo;s action plans in relation to the inspection reports in both areas. </p><p>I value the work that HIQA does to assess and monitor the quality of the foster care service provided by Tusla.  In future inspections HIQA will, I understand,  speak directly with children in foster care placements, so that  we can learn from their views and experiences.</p></reply>

During every stage of this process, their right to their identity will be the key determinant of the next steps that we take.</p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy of children transported to other jurisdictions, and the payment of fees/donations in relation to the placement of children, are other features of our history which are already in the public domain.  </p>  <p>  Indeed in approximately 20 of the current 126 identified cases of illegal registrations, the children were subsequently brought outside the jurisdiction.  The people affected in these cases also have an assigned social worker and will be offered contact and support.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about whether such activities are ongoing in recent times, I understand that in relation to intercountry adoption, the payment of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; expenses is allowed.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested in the work of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission which is examining adoption practices in the cases of mothers and children who were resident in specified institutions within its terms of reference.  The Commission is also examining the interaction of Mother and Baby Homes with other institutions, organisations and individuals involved with the placement of children from these institutions.</p>  <p>  The Social History module which will form part of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission&rsquo;s final report should prove to be a very valuable insight into our past treatment of mothers and their children in Ireland.</p></reply>

It works closely with my Department in this regard.</p>  <p>  Tusla has an important role to play in regard to a number of elements of the National Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  It is represented on a number of key interagency fora, including the Homelessness Interagency Group and the Dublin Joint Consultative Forum alongside the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). </p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the joint protocol is fully operational. I want to replicate this form of Inter-agency  co-operation nationally.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the DRHE have agreed a joint protocol to facilitate an inter-agency response to the many challenges posed by homelessness.  The main aim of the joint protocol is to work in partnership to address the family support needs of homeless families and to promote interagency cooperation.</p>  <p>  As part of the protocol, Tusla provides support to the DHRE&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres.  Here the role of Tusla staff is to participate as required with regard to issues involving child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) services.  </p>  <p>  Referrals received from Case Workers located in Assessment Centres are responded to as appropriate.  The Tusla Homelessness Liaison Officer provides broad-based supports to the centres.</p>  <p>  Tusla is also working together with the DHRE and the Family Resource Centres, themselves part-funded by Tusla, to coordinate family support services for families in family hubs and other forms of emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  Tusla collects a broad range of data and information relating to child protection.  However, Tusla does not currently collect national metrics on homeless families. </p></reply>

It should be noted that children living in direct provision are in the care of their parent(s). </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of Justice and Equality has responsibility for the direct provision service, which is  provided through a dedicated Reception and Integration Agency. Senior officials from my Department are currently engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of Standards for Direct Provision Centres, and I look forward to the results of this work. </p>  <p>  A senior social worker from Tusla is seconded to the Reception and Integration Agency, providing social work advice to the Agency, and working directly with Direct Provision Centres to develop their child safeguarding practices and links to community supports.</p>  <p>  Concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in direct provision are reported to Tusla, in line with Children First Legislation.</p>  <p>  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children where there are welfare or safety issues. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals, such as those I have named, to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold, to Tusla without delay. </p>  <p>  Direct Provision Centre managers are categorised as Designated Persons under Children First, and so are required to make mandatory reports of concerns relating to children resident in their centres. </p>  <p>  Direct Provision Centres are also required to have child safeguarding statements and practices in place. </p>  <p>  Unaccompanied, asylum-seeking children who seek the assistance of the State are placed in the statutory care of Tusla. Their needs are assessed by an allocated a social worker from a specialist team who work exclusively with unaccompanied minors. They receive appropriate educational, social, medical and counselling support.</p></reply>

My Department also works closely with the local City and County Childcare Committees in this regard.</p>  <p>  From September 2018, the ECCE Programme will revert to one single entry point in a given ECCE Programme Year (September).  From this time, children will be entitled to two full years of ECCE provision.

The additional funding secures much needed additional resources for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and provides a full second year of the ECCE free pre-school scheme. It also recognises the importance of improving conditions for our early years workforce.</p>  <p>  Tusla has received an additional &euro;40.6 million or a 5.7% increase which is additional to the &euro;37 million increase it received in 2017.  The total financial allocation to Tusla in 2018 is &euro;754 million.  This level of funding allows it progress a number of key priorities including the introduction of mandatory reporting under Children First, continue to address unallocated cases, address gaps in out of hours services and further invest in Family Resource Centres delivering services to families in disadvantaged areas across the country.</p>  <p>  The additional funding for early years childcare is another significant step in ensuring access to high quality, affordable early years care and education.  The total allocation to early years and childcare schemes for 2018 is &euro;485 million.  From September 2018, all children will be entitled to a full two years of the ECCE scheme or free pre-school, as it has become known.  This is a further enhancement that delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.  </p>  <p>  A total of &euro;62 million is being made available in 2018 to support the provision of youth services throughout the country including services for young people at risk of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the significant resources secured for 2018 facilitates my Department and its agencies to build on the good work by all involved in working with children and families to deliver on this Government&rsquo;s commitment to fundamentally reform the delivery of services.

Social workers review a child in care's situation at statutory child in care reviews, in consultation with the child's parents and other professionals.  </p>  <p>  If it is not possible to reach an agreement with a parent or guardian, or the parent or guardian seeks to resume care of the child, it may be necessary for Tusla to seek a direction or an order from the Courts.  The decision to make an application to the Courts is a serious step and Tusla makes every effort to identify supports or actions that could act as an alternate approach.  </p>  <p>  In light of this, I do not believe that steps are needed to reduce the numbers of children being received in to the voluntary care of Tusla with the agreement of their parents.  My Department is undertaking a review of the Child Care Act 1991 and submissions on this aspect of the legislation are being considered.</p></reply>

However there can be little doubt that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that  any  medium  to  long-term  period  living  in  a  hotel  or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be familiar with many of the initiatives undertaken by my Department and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to support children and families experiencing homelessness.  They include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate.  The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

The care order, including the length of time the order is to be in effect, is a decision for the Courts.  </p><p>Tusla does not publish data on the duration of individual care orders, and it is worth noting that, in certain circumstances, multiple care orders may have been made in relation to a single child.  Tusla does collate and publishes data on the length of time children are in care.  This annual figures for 2012 to 2016 are provided in the following table.</p><p><b>Table: Children in care by length of time in care</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>less than 1 year on</th><th>1 to 5 years on</th><th>More than 5 years on</th><th>TOTAL </th><th>% of Total less than 1 year</th><th>% of Total 1 to 5 years</th><th>% of Total More than 5 years</th></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>1151 </td><td>2842 </td><td>2339 </td><td>6332 </td><td>18% </td><td>45% </td><td>37% </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>1197 </td><td>2798 </td><td>2474 </td><td>6469 </td><td>19% </td><td>43% </td><td>38% </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>934 </td><td>3078 </td><td>2442 </td><td>6454 </td><td>15% </td><td>48% </td><td>39% </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>929 </td><td>2715 </td><td>2740 </td><td>6384 </td><td>15% </td><td>43% </td><td>43% </td></tr><tr><td>2016* </td><td>704 </td><td>2716 </td><td>2847 </td><td>6267 </td><td>11% </td><td>43% </td><td>45% </td></tr></table></p><p>*Pre-publication data provided by Tusla, subject to change</p><p>For children who are received into care for longer periods or until they are 18 years old, there will be clear reasons why this provides the stability and security for the child and that it is in their best interests. </p><p>In recent years, about 40% of admissions during the year are the result of a court order.  The remaining cases are received under voluntary care agreements, which are preferred where it is likely that the period in care is to be short.  It is also beneficial where there is a good relationship between parents and social workers.  For example a voluntary care agreement may be used where a parent is not able to care for their child while participating in a treatment programme or is in hospital for an extended period.</p><p>The time periods available for the consideration of the Courts are set out under each care order in sections 13 (Emergency care order), 17 (Interim care order) and 18 (care order) of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended.  Where it is in the child's best interests. the Court may make an order for a shorter period than the maximum provided for in the Act.  </p><p>To make a care order under section 18 of the Act, the Court must be satisfied that the child has been assaulted, ill treated, neglected or sexually abused; or that their development, health or welfare is or is likely to avoidably impaired if the order is not made.  The Courts may, for example, consider that the evidence of abuse is such that it is entirely inappropriate that the child would ever be returned to their parents.  Another example is, sadly, where a child comes into care because they have been orphaned.</p><p>One of the key principles of best practice in child protection and welfare is that children should only be received into care as a last resort, where other means of protecting them have been exhausted.  The child's written care plan would address the possibility of reunification with their family, where appropriate. The priority in all cases should be the best interests of the child, and consideration of the child's express wishes where it is possible to do so.</p><p>It is important to recall that the Courts can review a care orders at any point, and can then make a determination made as to whether the continuation of the order is in the child's best interests.  </p><p>A court decision is not required in order for a child to be reunited with family, if it is deemed to be appropriate. In some circumstances, a decision may be made by social workers that in their professional opinion, it is in the best interests of the child to remain in the care of Tusla in line with the Court's decision.</p></reply>

I am also conscious of the recommendations made in a number of reports, including the ESRI Report, in relation to the governance of the Programme. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Board of Tusla convened an expert panel to identify and examine a potential revised model of good practice and governance of the School Completion Programme. </p>  <p>  The panel comprised an external legal expert, representation of Tusla Educational Welfare Service, Finance, HR and Legal units, representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Department of Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It was chaired by the Tusla CEO.</p>  <p>  The expert panel has concluded its work.

To this end, I hosted a very informative School Completion Consultation event in Farmleigh House on January 29th last. </p>  <p>  Matters discussed included best practice and governance within the School Completion Programme.

I wish to see plans for the development of the SCP advanced in this quarter.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the positive outcomes that have been achieved within the School Completion Programme. </p>  <p>  For example, the proportion of students in DEIS schools who completed the senior cycle has increased from 68% in 2006/2007 to 82% by 2016.  This illustrates the benefit of the programme.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and Tusla Educational Welfare Service are fully committed to the future of the School Completion Programme and will continue to work to ensure that it will deliver the best possible outcomes for young people at risk of early school-leaving.</p></reply>

This includes funding for some 58 services throughout the country that offer a range of emergency accommodation and community-based supports to individuals and families affected by domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Many of these supports include counselling.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to avail of the opportunity to visit the centre in question, on the invitation of Deputy Funchion, earlier this year.  I support and value the work of these services.  I understand that Tusla has identified a need for development and expansion of outreach services in the region in question.  Tusla has advised me that it has allocated additional funding to the centre in question for the development and expansion of outreach services in the catchment area for this centre.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also completed a needs analysis project in the region, which will inform its future plans for service delivery in those areas, as well as the commissioning of services and allocation of funding. </p>  <p>  At present, I am not in a position to advise on the level of funding that will be available for services next year.  This issue will be clarified in the context of the 2019 Estimates process, and having regard to the overall level of funding available to Tusla next year. However, I can assure the Deputy that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services are a priority for me.</p>  <p>  It is important that the needs of victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are met in the best way possible, with due attention to the quality, accessibility, and outcome of services.</p></reply>

Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, such as the person referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I remain very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Bahrain, which I have spoken on in this House several times of late.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution are undermined by ongoing examples of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive approach, targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain.  In February of this year, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain, including the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017.  At the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March of this year, Ireland supported an EU statement under Item 4 (Human Rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) which reiterated calls on Bahrain &ldquo;to maintain its commitments as to the respect of freedom of speech and human rights defenders.&rdquo;  We also made reference to Bahrain in our national Item 4 statement highlighting our grave concerns over the ending of the defacto moratorium on use of the death penalty. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Bahrain, and will utilise every appropriate opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns with the Bahraini authorities.</p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome.  It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.  This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p><p>The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready.  Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. </p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published last November &lsquo;<i>Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and training&rsquo;</i>.  In total 34 reports analyzing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website:<i> . </i></p><p>Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan.  The Enterprise Strategy 2025 Renewed was recently launched and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. </p><p>Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.</p></reply>

Underpinned by the current shared EU regulatory framework, cross-border trade at present represents the first export market for 73% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium-sized companies.  More than 7,000 businesses trade from Northern Ireland across the island of Ireland, supporting over 165,000 jobs.Recent research has also shown a high degree of integration of the economies North and South, including in supply chains and trade in intermediary products.  Northern Ireland accounts for between ten and twelve percent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and seven to eight percent of imports.  Given that the population of Northern Ireland is less than three percent of the UK total, this shows the closeness of the economic ties between both parts of the island.</p>  <p>  This underlines the importance of securing an outcome in the Brexit negotiations that maintains an invisible border on the island of Ireland.  This objective goes beyond trade and is to protect the Good Friday agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.  Peace and prosperity are mutually reinforcing and cross-border trade is an important element in supporting jobs and building prosperity.</p>  <p>  I regularly meet the Foreign Secretary, including at meetings of Foreign Ministers in an EU context, and internationally, as well as other UK Ministers who are heavily engaged in the Brexit negotiation process.  Ireland&rsquo;s views on the importance of a workable resolution to the issues relating to the border on the island of Ireland are known to the UK Government and are discussed on a regular basis when Irish and UK Ministers meet.  Ireland and the United Kingdom share many areas of mutual interest and concern and we will continue to work on areas of commonality with the aim of reaching an outcomes that reflects Ireland&rsquo;s well-stated objective of achieving as close as possible a relationship between the EU and the UK after Brexit.</p></reply>

After its publication last week, Michel Barnier while also welcoming this step, raised questions and concerns about the proposal.  The absence of anything on regulatory alignment is clearly a major gap &ndash; though the UK has acknowledged that this aspect needs to be negotiated &ndash; as is the suggestion that the arrangement should be time-limited, though it is welcome that the date of end-2021 is aspirational.  The Commission, in its further analysis of the paper, has identified numerous issues related to the proposal&rsquo;s legal and technical viability, and to its compatibility with the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. It is the Commission which is the Union&rsquo;s negotiator with the British Government on these  issues.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus remains on the outcome we need to see, of which a key element is ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is welcome that the UK&rsquo;s commitment to this is reaffirmed in its proposal , and that the commitments and guarantees provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 and repeated by Prime Minister May in her letter to President Tusk in March have been reiterated.</p>  <p>  While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided. We must have certainty in all scenarios on the commitments made on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This certainty requires agreement on the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  I therefore very much hope that there will now be intense engagement between the British Government and the Commission over the next two weeks before the European Council on 28/29 June.  As we have repeatedly stated, substantial progress  is required by then.</p></reply>

Member States must introduce the ATAD exit tax, or bring existing exit taxes into alignment with the ATAD exit tax where relevant, no later than 1 January 2020.</p>  <p>  The objective of the ATAD exit tax is to impose a charge to tax when a company migrates out of a State while holding assets, or makes certain transfers of assets out of a State, in circumstances where those assets have increased in value and therefore hold an unrealised capital gain.</p>  <p>  The potential yields of an exit tax from 2010 to date at the Deputy&rsquo;s proposed rates ranging from 1% to 5% cannot be determined with certainty as such a calculation would require information on the unrealised gains, if any, latent within the value of assets transferred.  Similarly, any potential future exit tax yield from assets on-shored in recent years would depend on the increase in value of these assets, if any, before any future transfer offshore.</p>  <p>  However I would note that in many cases, intangible assets such as licence rights and patents in the pharmaceutical and high-tech sectors have a finite life-span and depreciate over their useful lives &ndash; for example over the period for which a drug is protected by a patent or the period until an IT sector IP asset is superseded by technological advancements.  Depreciating assets of this nature are unlikely to give rise to an exit tax on migration.</p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total)</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools. </p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>   I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector. </p></reply>

No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017 (S.I.

The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.   </p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act has not yet been commenced. Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits.  To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend the Adoptive Leave Act and will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.  </p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.   </p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.</p></reply>

However, the latter mechanism did not deliver the numbers envisaged and the Government has chosen to fill the gap by making additional pledges for programme refugees and through the recently announced IRPP Humanitarian Assistance Programme (IHAP), which will provide for the admission of up to 530 immediate family members of Irish citizens, persons with Convention refugee or subsidiary protection status and persons with programme refugee status.  </p>  <p>  Ireland had committed to accept 1,040 refugees by the end of 2017 under the resettlement strand of the programme and currently 820 people have arrived.   The remaining individuals are due to arrive in the coming months.</p>  <p>  I have pledged to take a further 945 refugees from Lebanon between 2018 (345) and 2019 (600).   At the present time it is intended to undertake two selection missions in Lebanon in 2018, one in June and one in September, in order to select the 345 refugees who will be part of the 2018 pledge. </p>  <p>  To date 1,022 people have arrived from Greece. This completed Ireland&rsquo;s current relocation programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has taken 41 unaccompanied minors from Calais to date and both IRPP and Tusla are in preliminary discussion with officials in Italy and Greece with a view to accepting up to 60 unaccompanied minors before the end of 2019.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the IRPP for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  </p>  <p>   As the Deputy will appreciate, a tailored and flexible approach is required to take account of differing family configurations and the availability of housing stock.  Given the current difficulties in the housing market it is taking about twelve months to source suitable accommodation that match the needs of refugee families.  The Irish Red Cross are also using pledged accommodation from the public to try and meet the needs of single persons as few accommodation options exist within the local authority sector for this cohort. Refugees, once resettled, largely fall under the auspices of the local authority "implementing partner" who provide appropriate services for a period of eighteen months to assist with integration.</p></reply>

The information can be found in the Information Centre &ndash; under Statistics &amp;amp; Information &ndash; Census Reports.  In accordance with the latest census on the 18th April 2018, there were 2,001 male prisoners accommodated in single cells.</p><p>Given the current number of prisoners in custody &ndash; 4,006 on 12th June 2018 - the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety. </p><p>It should be borne in mind that in some cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.  There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.</p><p>I am satisfied that there are adequate spaces for male prisoners in the prison estate, and these spaces are configured appropriately, to deal with all categories of prisoners.  The Deputy will appreciate that my officials are concentrating on aligning our prisoner population numbers with the Inspector of Prisons' recommended bed capacity in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p></reply>

In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted. The Criminal Justice Act 2017 also strengthened Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail providing a power of arrest without warrant, and made provisions to increase the use of curfews and to facilitate the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.  </p>  <p>  In terms of available statistics, the Deputy will appreciate that given the new bail laws were only introduced in 2017, the full impact of these provisions will not yet be reflected in the official recorded crime statistics. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have requested that the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistics body, provide the Deputy with the most readily available figures in relation to crimes committed by persons when on bail.</p></reply>

As the economy improves and we approach full employment, labour as well as skills  shortages are becoming apparent in some sectors with the consequent potential to constrict growth due to labour shortages.</p>  <p>  In recognising the changing economy and labour market plus the challenges faced by enterprises in attracting sufficient labour, officials of my Department are undertaking a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs. </p>  <p>  The review is overseen by an Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by this Department, and included a public and stakeholder consultation as well as an EU and international benchmarking exercise. A report is expected before the end of June with recommendations on a framework for the future operation of the employment permits regime.</p>  <p>  The occupations of labourers, mechanics and carpenters are currently  included on the ineligible list of employments for employment permit purposes. In order to remove an occupation from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages and not to other factors such as salary and/or working conditions.  </p>  <p>  To this end, the construction sector must engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as the relevant lead Department for the sector, in the preparation of a detailed business case setting out the necessary data and evidence to demonstrate that recruitment difficulties are solely due to labour shortages and not to other factors. This business case would then need to be put forward to my Department as part of the ongoing regular reviews of the employment lists. </p>  <p>  Details on how to apply for an employment permit, including the criteria required, as well as various checklist documents and a user guide which will assist in the application process are available from the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; www.dbei.gov.ie.  This section also includes a comprehensive Frequently Asked Questions document which answers the majority of the most common queries received from applicants regarding employment permits.  A helpline for information on the employment permit regime can be contacted on (01) 417 5333 or Locall 1890 201 616 and any e-mail queries can be directed to employmentpermits@dbei.gov.ie</p></reply>

This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;). The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens. Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rightsholders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been thoroughly engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal and have been successful in achieving a number of amendments to address the concerns of our stakeholders. On 25 May, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at Coreper and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate to commence negotiations with the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and while I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, I fully support the intention of this proposal which is vitally important to both the DSM and the digital economy. Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rightsholders, and citizens. To that end, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage positively with the negotiations on the proposal going forward to ensure that Ireland can benefit from its many merits as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The report analyses globalisation&rsquo;s effect on growth across a total of 42 countries.   The report found that Ireland is the most globalised economy out of the 42 studied and is highly integrated especially in global capital markets.  The average annual per capita income gain from 1990 onwards was &euro;1,261 placing Ireland 4th of the countries studied.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is an open, highly developed and well-connected economy that is dependent on international trade and investment for sustainable growth.  I am well aware of the shifting and evolving global challenges which may affect us in the future.  No open economy like ours can be fully shielded against global impacts.  However, I am confident that we have the right policies to build resilience where possible and firmly strengthen our competitiveness and innovative capacity, thus ensuring the economy is properly positioned to meet any external challenges.  </p>  <p>  From a Trade policy perspective, the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  We aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion, achieve 80% of indigenous export growth outside of the UK market and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.</p>  <p>  On the 12th of March, Enterprise Ireland announced that it is set to undertake over 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of Enterprise Ireland clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets.  The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, 70 of these export focused trade events will be led by Government Ministers.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our Enterprise Agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our all trading sectors.  The EU suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with third countries help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.  Brexit has reinforced the importance of accelerating the delivery of EU trade deals with leading economies and regional blocs.</p>  <p>  Most recently, the EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  This means that Irish companies may now take advantage of the all important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.</p>  <p>  The EU and Japan reached political agreement last year on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and the EU and Mexico reached political agreement earlier this year on the modernisation of the EU-Mexico Global Agreement.  The EU negotiations with the Mercosur countries continue.  Last month, EU Trade Ministers approved negotiating directives for free trade agreements with Australia and with New Zealand with the first formal negotiation rounds envisaged to take place in July 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements giving Irish based firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries, including SMEs.  To this end, my Department has commissioned a major examination of the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from EU Free Trade Agreements which will be available later this year.</p>  <p>  This week, the Taoiseach launched 'Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025' which represents the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken, seeking to double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint in the period to 2025.  Global Ireland 2025 will support Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE through the community drugs schemes, it must apply to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p><p>As outlined in the 2016 IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the applicant), whether to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine or refuse to reimburse it.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland. However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues to be addressed, in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p><p>I have indicated a willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill. </p>  <p>  The specific provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme. These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority. The Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  Commercial surrogacy raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates. In light of this the General Scheme explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy being conducted in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogates) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.</p></reply>

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child.</p>  <p>  Worldwide cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and HPV immunisation is an important part of our childhood immunisation programmes which protects women from developing cancer later in their lives. Ninety nine percent of cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of certain high risk types of the Human Papillomavirus, which is acquired during sexual contact. </p>  <p>  HPV is the most common infection transmitted by intimate or sexual contact in the world. Approximately 50 to 80% of people who are sexually active contract some form of HPV at least once in their lifetime.  There are over 100 types of HPV.  Around 40 types of HPV can infect the genital tract.  Some of these are low-risk types which cause genital warts, while others are high-risk types that are associated with the development of various cancers such as cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and throat.  </p>  <p>  Cervical cancer impacts the lives of a large number of women in Ireland every year. It is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged 25 to 39 years. In 2018 more than 90 Irish women will die from cervical cancer.  A further 280 women will need intensive treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, to help them overcome invasive cervical cancer. Unfortunately, 4 in 10 of these women will die within 5 years. A further 6,500 women will need hospital treatment to remove precancerous changes in the cervix.</p>  <p>  We are all aware of the old saying that prevention is better than cure, and this is especially true of cervical cancer. In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. In 2011 a catch up programme commenced for all girls in second level school and was completed in 2014.  Uptake rates for the HPV vaccine peaked at 87% in 2014/15 and have fallen since then.</p>  <p>  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland - Gardasil and Cervarix.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the Schools Immunisation Programme. It provides protection against two high-risk HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancers, and two HPV types that cause 90% of genital warts. It has been licensed worldwide since 2006 and is used in over 25 European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  The introduction of HPV immunisation has had a significant impact in many parts of the world.  Countries with high vaccine uptake rates have seen the highest impact: In Scotland where 90% of girls have been vaccinated since 2008 there has been a 90% fall in HPV infections in vaccinated girls. Precancerous growths of the cervix have been reduced by more than 50% in countries such as Australia, Sweden and Scotland.  Finland recently published the evidence that HPV immunisation protects against invasive HPV-associated cancer.</p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to make a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination. The HSE National Immunisation Office has developed a comprehensive range of materials for parents, schools and medical practitioners as part of the immunisation programme. The HPV website has been endorsed by the WHO. The HPV Vaccine Information Campaign helps parents access trusted sources of information.  This campaign will be supported through social and digital media activity and local and national radio advertisements.</p>  <p>  The initial evidence suggests that this campaign is having a positive effect. Provisional figures show uptake rates have increased by 11% this year to 62%.  While this increase is very welcome, we must continue to work to get back to we were before.  As recently as the 2014/15 academic year the uptake rate for HPV was 87%.  </p>  <p>  This Government fully supports the HPV immunisation programme and recognises its benefits. We must continue to focus on increasing uptake rates as the best way of reducing cervical cancer, and I would encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important vaccine.</p></reply>

To support this, the Department of Health is currently engaged in the development of a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-care. This will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service-allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner and will help to improve access to home-care services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home-care will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided. </p>  <p>  The development of a new home care scheme is a complex undertaking which will involve significant legislative, operational and financial resources. A significant amount of detailed work remains to be undertaken before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  Work in relation to the cost of the new statutory scheme is ongoing as part of this process.  </p>  <p>  However, on the basis of current demand and demographic projections, it is likely that increased investment will be required to support the implementation of the new statutory scheme. The HSE home-care services budget for 2018 is &euro;408 million, which it is anticipated will support the delivery of 17.094m hours of home support to 50,500 people. It is expected that there will be a significant increase in demand for home-care over the coming years. Furthermore home-care service-users have increasingly complex care-needs and there are sustained cost-pressures within the sector which are likely to inflate in the coming years. </p>  <p>  In relation to the request for an estimated cost I have asked the HSE to correspond directly with the Deputy to advise on the cost of servicing the current wait list for Home Help and Home Care Packages under the rules of the current scheme. </p></reply>

The strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural, and family life in their own communities for as long as possible. The strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the health and wellbeing of our ageing citizens.</p>  <p>  Many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.</p>  <p>  New arrangements to implement and monitor implementation of NPAS were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in 2016. The revised approach recommits to the core principles of the strategy, establishes a mechanism to give stakeholder groups effective and ongoing access to bodies and agencies relevant to older people through an annual forum for stakeholders, and monitors the effect of the implementation process through the publication on a regular basis of a Positive Ageing National Indicators Report. </p>  <p>  The inaugural stakeholder forum took place in 2017. Stakeholders were asked to identify key priorities to propose to Government to consider for its focus in the coming year. Through this forum, clear channels of communication between the stakeholder representative group and relevant Government Departments to discuss these priorities have been facilitated by the Department of Health. Based on the success of and interest in the forum, plans are currently advancing to hold another stakeholder forum in 2018.</p>  <p>  The strategy comprises four national goals, developed to address key aspects of older people&rsquo;s lives. The four goals, and examples of progress to date thereunder, follow.</p>  <p>  National Goal 1:</p>  <p>  - Remove barriers to participation and provide more opportunities for the continued involvement of people as they age in all aspects of cultural, economic, and social life in their communities according to their needs, preferences, and capacities.</p>  <p>  A key objective under this goal is to promote the concept of active citizenship and to encourage people of all ages to become more involved in their communities. Age Friendly, an organisation whose remit it is to help to create an inclusive, equitable society in which older people can live full, active, valued, and healthy lives under the guidance of the National Positive Ageing Strategy, have been very successful to date in this area. Age Friendly is a World Health Organisation inspired movement which embraces the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population. In Ireland each of the 31 local authorities have signed up to the Age Friendly Programme. Older People&rsquo;s Councils have been set up and are running throughout Ireland as part of this programme, as well, ensuring a voice for older people in local government and community concerns. Implementation on this front does not rest with Age Friendly alone; there are many NGOs engaged in making Ireland a better country in which to grow old and they do so with the objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy informing their work.</p>  <p>  National Goal 2:</p>  <p>  - Support people as they age to maintain, improve, or manage their physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy is strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where wellbeing is supported at every level of society. The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with accurate information on how to improve their health and wellbeing and to make the healthy choices easier choices. Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and wellbeing and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate.</p>  <p>  Commitments within Government that further the strategy in relation to health and wellbeing include the development of a statutory scheme for homecare, which will aim to improve access to the homecare services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way, thus enabling people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  National Goal 3:</p>  <p>  - Enable people to age with confidence, security, and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  Across communities many initiatives, strategies, and schemes are in place that firmly support this goal. One such is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Older People Strategy, which aims to ensure the policing needs of older people in Ireland are met to the highest standards. This supports the objective of empowering people to live free from fear in their homes and communities, as they age. With regards to facilitating older people to live in homes which are suitable to their physical and social needs, the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government and the Department of Health are consulting, through a Joint Committee on Housing and Health, on a framework for supported housing, to facilitate people to age well and healthily in place.</p>  <p>  National Goal 4:</p>  <p>  - Support and use research about people as they age to better inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of the strategy implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative (HaPAI) has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the strategy and establish an on-going system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing. The Initiative monitors changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. This is done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators which are published every two years. The initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first Positive Ageing National Indicators Report was published in November 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland. The second Positive Ageing National Indicators report is due to be published later this year.</p>  <p>  With regards to the cost of implementing the strategy, the HSE provide funding to many organisations that work with older people and further the objectives of the strategy.

In 2014, PHECC developed the First Aid Response (FAR) education and training standard, building on its foundational Cardiac First Response course.  </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is responsible for the enforcement of Occupational First Aid (OFA) provisions of Part 7 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007. I understand that since September last, FAR is now recognised by the HSA as the recognised standard to meet occupational first aid needs in the workplace.  Both the HSA and PHECC issued joint communications to inform OFA providers and instructors, recognised institutions, students and employers of the key activities and milestones over the course of the transition from OFA to FAR.</p>  <p>  Training institutions/individuals who wish to conduct courses and award PHECC qualifications must comply with and meet the PHECC Education and Training standard commensurate with the particular course they wish to conduct, and certificate they seek to award.  Therefore, training organisations, including sole traders, who wish to deliver FAR and FAR instructor training are encouraged to become Recognised Institutions (RI) with PHECC. This involves an application process and a commitment to adhere to Council rules for RIs and the Quality Review Framework.  </p>  <p>  There is no prohibition on any training provider being recognised by PHECC to deliver training, provided that they meet the standard set by Council. In the interest of protecting patients and the public, only approved organisations and individuals are permitted to advertise PHECC approved courses or use the PHECC logo on promotional material. </p>  <p>  PHECC provided 5 regional information sessions earlier this year for FAR instructors, OFA instructors, other individuals and organisations interested in its standards and model of course provision. In addition, it has launched online portal to stream line its application process for RI status and course approvals.</p>  <p>  I have been assured that PHECC has and will continue to meet organisations and/or individuals to address any issues or concerns that have arisen in relation to the transition from the OFA to the FAR standard.</p></reply>

In limited circumstances, the response period may be extended to two months, where requests are complex or comprise a number of requests.  An individual&rsquo;s access to his or her medical records may be restricted where the data controller believes that access is likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the data subject.  No fee is payable where the request is by an individual to access his/her personal records. However, where a controller believes a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, they may either charge a fee for administrative costs in dealing with the request or refuse to act on the request. The burden of demonstrating why a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive rests on the health service provider.</p>  <p>  Access to one's medical records may also be made under the Freedom of Information Act 2014 if the records are held by a public body within the meaning of the Act.  The FOI Act applies to the HSE and to voluntary hospitals as well as to a number of health agencies. It does not apply to private hospitals.  It applies to records kept by GPs in relation to patients who are medical card holders but not to the records of private patients.  The HSE is considered to hold the records of medical card holders for FOI purposes.  Under the FOI Act, an individual&rsquo;s access to his or her medical record can be restricted where the body holding it believes that to give access might be prejudicial to physical or mental health, well-being or emotional condition of the individual.  However, where that view is taken the body, access may still be possible through a health professional having expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the record.  No fees are applicable where the request involves access to an individual&rsquo;s own personal records.  FOI bodies have 20 working days to process such requests.</p>  <p>  I would also highlight to the Deputy the Medical Council&rsquo;s Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics (8th Edition) which states that patients have a right to get copies of their medical records except where this is likely to cause serious harm to their physical or mental health. </p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that patients should have timely access to their personal medical records with no additional cost or administrative burden and will be keeping this matter under review.</p></reply>

The WHO European Region adopted the first-ever Action Plan for viral hepatitis in September 2016. The Action Plan follows the 2016 WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis. It addresses viral hepatitis as a public health threat and aims to achieve these targets in the European Region by 2030. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) was established in 2015, following a key recommendation from my Department&rsquo;s 2014 Report, &lsquo;A Public Health Plan for the Pharmaceutical Treatment of Hepatitis C&rsquo;. The Programme is a multi-annual public health plan, which aims to provide treatment across a range of healthcare settings to all persons living with hepatitis C in Ireland. The National Programme's goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026.</p></reply>

This involved a multi-annual plan for the pharmaceutical treatment of Hepatitis C, based on clinical prioritisation. Patients with the highest risk were prioritised and a phased treatment process delivered over a number of years to ensure that resources were managed efficiently and effectively. An annual sum of &euro;30m has been provided in each year since 2015 to facilitate this treatment programme. At the request of my predecessor as Minister for Health, the HSE established a governance and management structure to oversee the implementation of the multi-annual pharmaceutical treatment plan. This was to ensure that clinical needs were addressed and that there was appropriate national direction and co-ordination such that treatment plans were cost-effective and matched to the level of funding available.</p><p>The Government remains committed to the objectives of the Public Health Plan for the Pharmaceutical Treatment of Hepatitis C and to the ultimate eradication of hepatitis C in the Irish population. In the light of experience with the programme to date and its success in treating more than 2,000 patients, the HSE is, as the Deputy will be aware, working to develop  proposals for integrated care models for hepatitis C treatment, in community and acute settings, and I will consider these, including any resourcing aspects, when I receive them.</p></reply>

Invariably the vet advises the owner/trainer on the treatment options be it with the intention of the dog returning to fitness for racing or in the case of more serious injuries that the greyhound will be kept as a pet by the owner or rehomed through an agency. However, where injuries are of a very serious nature, and in the interest of the long term welfare of the animal, the veterinary surgeon with the owner's permission will decide to euthanise the greyhound.</p>  <p>  In the period between July 2014 to the end of December 2017 there were over 336,000 starters at the Bord na gCon controlled tracks in Ireland. As with any sport where speed is a major element, injuries do occur. The numbers injured in this period averaged at 0.45% of starters. Bord na gCon endeavours to minimise the risk of injury to racing greyhounds and is proactive in ensuring that best practice in track maintenance is followed, with inspections by Bord na gCon racing/maintenance and project manager overseeing the work of local track groundsmen.</p></reply>

This is a requirement in the relevant EU Payment Regulations and is a long-standing EU audit requirement. GLAS 2017 balancing payments commenced payment week ending 18 May 2018 as per my Department&rsquo;s commitment at the beginning of the year.</p><p>To date, over 98% of eligible GLAS participants have received their balancing payment. A number of cases remain ineligible for payment as the GLAS participant and/or their Advisor need to take action. I would encourage any GLAS applicant with outstanding obligations, such as the submission of a Nutrient Management Plan or finalisation of a Commonage Management Plan to speak to their Advisor and ensure that this work is completed as a priority. Without the submission of all the required information, these applicants will remain ineligible for further GLAS payments. </p><p>Please find in the table a further breakdown of GLAS 2017 payments

The EU target is 22.5% and Ireland is clearly well ahead of this target.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, the European Commission published the European Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy. The strategy focuses on plastic production and use. It sets a goal of ensuring all plastic packaging will be recyclable by 2030. </p>  <p>  Since then, I have written to the European Commissioner with responsibility for the environment to welcome the plastics strategy. I assured him Ireland fully embraced the ambitions of the new strategy. I asked the Commission to focus, in particular, on the most difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items such as plastic straws. I am determined to make sure these products, if they come onto the market here or elsewhere in Europe will be recyclable or compostable and that they will not go into landfill sites. </p>  <p>  I have also welcomed very recent proposals by the European Commission to tackle the problems posed by plastic single use items.  I believe that working proactively with our European colleagues will achieve a greater environmental benefit.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, in line with the potential for European bans and restrictions, I am considering what financial incentives or penalties I can introduce , to tackle the problems caused by single-use plastic items in a way that is compatible with EU legislation.</p>  <p>  I am looking to bring forward practical solutions along with my government colleagues responsible for marine environment and fisheries that will work in an Irish context.</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p>  <p>  In light of its significant health benefits, I decided to extend the ban to the entire territory of the State.  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies and the residential fuel industry. Discussions with stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway with a view to introducing a national ban on a phased basis over twelve months commencing in Autumn 2018. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities, including those bordering Northern Ireland, are primarily responsible for the enforcement of legislation on solid fuel including the &lsquo;smoky coal&rsquo; regulations within their functional areas at present, and this will continue after the extension of the ban. The powers that Local Authorities have in this area are extensive and will apply nationally. For example:</p>  <p>- Local Authority staff may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples</p>  <p>- A Local Authority may bring a prosecution under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations</p>  <p>- The maximum fine amounts for breaches of the Regulations is &euro;5,000 on summary conviction</p>  <p>- Fixed payment notices (or &lsquo;on the spot fines&rsquo;) applied by the Local Authority are in operation for alleged offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of prohibited fuels in Low Smoke Zones (LSZs)</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures available to Local Authorities outlined above, my officials are currently examining other enforcement options to ensure the success of the ban, including the establishment of multiagency teams. This is in line with other areas of environmental enforcement such as waste, where such an approach has proved successful.</p></reply>

The cases were identified during an analysis of adoption records that were transferred to Tusla by the former adoption society St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.</p>  <p>  This is a very serious and sensitive issue. People have the right to know of their true origins and, where we have clear evidence, I believe we have an obligation to tell the people affected.  Some may know already, but for others it will be entirely new and very difficult information indeed.</p>  <p>  An experienced Information and Tracing social worker has been assigned to each of the 126 cases. They will be leading the process of making contact with those affected that can be identified. This includes the person who was incorrectly registered (the child), the birth mother and the people who participated in the incorrect registrations and subsequently raised these children as their own.  </p>  <p>  I would emphasise that the process will be measured, sensitive, and at the pace of the individual concerned.  People should also be aware that it is a detailed, methodical process, and will take some time. </p>  <p>  The assigned social worker will support individuals through the process and link them in to formal and informal supports and services, as required. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that as Minister I do not get, and nor should I, personal details of the individuals concerned.  If the individual to whom the Deputy is referring to is one of the 126, Tusla will be touch with her, but this process may take a little time, as tracing is being done on the basis of records that are in the main over 50 years old.  She can also, through the Tusla Helpline, apply for an information and tracing service, even if she is not one of the 126.</p>  <p>  In relation to other issues of concern listed by the Deputy, I am aware that an incorrect birth registration can impact on a number of areas of a person's life.  I will keep these issues under review, as they emerge, and will address in conjunction with my ministerial colleagues, as appropriate.</p></reply>

This will bring the total current youth funding available to my Department to &euro;58.9m.  The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country. </p>  <p>  These schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations.  The continued funding of voluntary youth organisations through the scheme is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people.</p>  <p>  Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund, Rounds 1 and 2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and certain other programmes including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and Youth Information Centres.  </p>  <p>  The Local Youth Club Grant Scheme supports youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through the local Education and Training Boards. Each year, in the region of 1700 local youth clubs are eligible to apply under the scheme. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken.  This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.</p>  <p>  Last year each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards (ETB), was invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for the establishment of new services and to nominate a project or service to be considered for augmentation. In total twenty-eight applications for new services were received.  Subsequently I approved the establishment of ten new targeted youth services across the country and the expansion of a further seven to respond to new demand from increased population and needs of young people.  Funding was also allocated for the establishment of 5 new sample projects in 2016. These projects provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions.</p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed last year which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with, and regularly meets, the national and major regional youth organisations, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, which has a representative role for the voluntary youth services.</p></reply>

The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department has set up a working group with five Youth Officers focussed on strategic planning for future capital funding for the youth sector. </p>  <p>  My Department also maintains close contact with the national youth organisations and I and officials from my Department meet formally with these organisations twice a year to share knowledge and information on developments in the youth sector. </p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. </p>  <p>  In 2018, &euro;58.9 m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services.   In 2018, a provisional allocation of &euro;539,283 has been made for the projects and services under Kildare Youth Services, which operates under Youth Work Ireland. My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.   </p>  <p>  In addition, I am pleased to approve the establishment the Capital Funding Scheme in 2018. The primary focus of this scheme will be to provide small to medium capital grants to qualifying youth projects which are in receipt of funding from DCYA.  Some &euro;2m has been made available nationally, and eligible youth projects in Kildare can make an application through Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board.</p></reply>

This is distinct from the interim TCA model being made available as an option for those affected by the 2012 rate band changes.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question may be based on an inaccurate report in a national newspaper last month.  There is no basis to state that all workers retiring from 2020 will only get a full State pension if they made PRSI contributions for 40 years.  The criteria required for a full pension under that new approach have not yet been determined, and are currently subject to a public consultation which I launched on 28th May.  Issues such as the number of years required for a full pension, transitional arrangements and treatment of the self-employed are addressed in the consultation questions, and in the accompanying documentation.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, I outlined at the launch that these final details will not be decided upon until I have considered the submissions received in this process, a point which was re-emphasised by two of my officials, in their presentations to stakeholders and press who were present. It was explicitly stressed in those presentations that, whatever the final model, it would have to accommodate those who were self-employed before 1988.</p>  <p>  It might be noted that if such matters had already been decided upon, there would be little point in conducting a public consultation on the design of the final system.</p>  <p>  This public consultation is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and I would encourage all interested stakeholders to contribute to the survey there.  The materials included as part of the consultation examine issues such as the extension of compulsory PRSI for self-employed in 1988, and seeks the views of stakeholders on how best to ensure they are not disadvantaged as a result of this reform.</p>  <p>  The position regarding part-time workers is complicated.  As in most countries, there are thresholds below which employees and self-employed persons are not compulsorily covered for pensions under the PRSI system.  Generally, the people below these thresholds receive lower pay than can be received while on Jobseekers benefit, and so they will often be either in receipt of a jobseekers payment (and credited contributions) in respect of the days they do not work, or they will be people who would not qualify for a jobseekers payment.</p>  <p>  In April 1990, the threshold for employees changed from being based on time worked (i.e. less than 18 hours in a week) to a monetary amount.  Some were affected by this change at that time but many others were not.  However, over time this monetary amount has been very significantly eroded by inflation, and is now only &euro;38 in a given week.  </p>  <p>  It is not the case that this reform disadvantages part-time workers.  Most of those who fell below the PRSI threshold in the past (and who do not have credited contributions for those periods), whether in the 1990s or today, generally have significant gaps which result in reduced entitlements under the current Yearly Average system.  In most cases, such workers facing a reduced pension under the current system are expected to fare significantly better under the TCA approach.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are three separate grants available and local authorities receive an overall allocation, with responsibility for the apportionment between the schemes being a matter for each local authority. </p><p>The recently announced funding allocation in 2018 for the schemes is &euro;66.25m, comprising &euro;53m Exchequer funding and &euro;13.25m from local authority resources.  Details of the allocations for these grant schemes in 2018 are available at the following link: .</p><p>At the end of May 2018, over 28% of this allocation has been spent.</p><p>Information on these grant schemes, including the numbers of grants funded per annum and the funding provided to each local authority, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link .</p><p>My Department also provides funding to local authorities under the Disabled Persons Grants Scheme, for adaptations and extensions to the existing social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants. Funding under this scheme has increased progressively in recent years; from a position of &euro;7m in 2013, funding of over &euro;13m was provided in both 2016 and 2017, supporting improvements in over 1,000 houses in 2016 and over 1,300 houses in 2017. The average grant in 2017 was approximately &euro;10,000.</p><p>As local authorities have delegated responsibility in the use of the DPG scheme and the distribution of the funding is a matter for them to administer, data in relation to the number of social homes improved or adapted was not collected prior to 2016.</p><p>Local authorities have submitted to my Department details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this scheme in 2018. These have now been evaluated and funding allocations will be confirmed to the local authorities shortly. In order to ensure that there were no delays for priority and urgent cases, all local authorities were advised that they can undertake works of up to 65% of their 2017 allocation, in advance of the 2018 full year allocation. This has allowed them to plan and progress works under the scheme and will support the full utilisation of the 2018 allocation by end-year.</p></reply>

Both are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland is obliged to monitor their populations and report to the European Commission on their conservation status. A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both species since 2009. The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in June 2013 and is available on the website <i>.  </i></p><p>As part of my Department's established seal monitoring programme, Grey Seal and Harbour Seal numbers have continued to be recorded around the country. The next conservation assessment of the status of both seal species is under preparation and is due for submission to the Commission in early 2019</p><p>Seals have a broad diet which varies depending on the species of seal, the geographic region and also the availability of fish and other prey. Studies of the interaction between seals and various commercial fisheries in Ireland are ongoing. This work by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Marine Institute and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, towards which my Department provides technical and licensing input under relevant conservation legislation, includes the recording of seal depredation (damage to fish or removal of fish by seals during fishery operations) as part of the National At Sea Catch Sampling Programme. It also involves targeted regionally based studies concerning seal bycatch for example and the ongoing development of acoustic deterrence to mitigate seal fisheries interactions. </p><p>In relation to seal predation on salmonids, for example, a study published in 2014 by Inland Fisheries Ireland, focusing on two estuaries of significance for native salmon, found considerable differences in the amount of salmonids in the diet of locally occurring seals and concluded that the removal of salmonids by seals and other predators must be placed in the context of the amount removed by fisheries (see ).</p><p>All of these studies will continue to inform policy in relation to seal protection and meeting our obligations under the EU Habitats Directive.</p></reply>
