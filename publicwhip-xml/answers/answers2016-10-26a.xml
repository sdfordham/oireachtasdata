I spoke with Theresa May on the day of her appointment, and had a bilateral meeting with her in London shortly thereafter.  More recently, at the European Council meeting in Brussels on 20-21 October, although the UK's decision to leave the EU was not formally on the agenda for this meeting, Prime Minister May updated EU leaders on recent developments in the UK, as an information point.  She confirmed that the decision to leave the EU is irreversible for her Government, and that the UK will invoke Article 50 before the end of March next year.  </p>  <p>  At EU level, I have also had extensive discussions with partners and the Institutions both in bilateral exchanges and in the wider format of the European Council itself, most recently last week in Brussels.  At every opportunity in these exchanges I raise the well-known priority issues for Ireland, in relation to Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area, our economy and the future of the EU itself. </p>  <p>  As agreed among EU leaders in June, there can be no formal negotiation with the United Kingdom until Article 50 is  triggered. </p>  <p>  We also await more detail from the UK on what kind of future relationship it will seek with the EU.  The current lack of clarity however does not preclude us from preparing for the negotiations and, indeed, this work began over 12 months ago.  Since the referendum result, work has intensified across Government with a view to safeguarding Ireland's interests, minimising any adverse impacts on our economy and on the free movement of people, goods and services on these islands, and ensuring that stability in Northern Ireland is maintained. We will also continue to work with our EU partners and with the UK with the aim of ensuring a strong EU-UK relationship and a well-managed withdrawal.</p></reply>

It would not be appropriate for me, therefore, to comment on the case until that process and my Department's initial assessment is completed.</p><p>I can, however, describe in general terms how the Media Mergers regime functions.</p><p>Upon receipt of notification from the Parties, a phase 1<i></i>examination of the merger is carried out by my Department.  This examination is guided by the relevant criteria laid out in the legislation and by the Guidelines on Media Mergers, both of which are available on my Department's website. </p><p>This examination process concentrates on a number of important criteria or measures, including diversity of ownership in the relevant media sector and in the wider media market, editorial management, diversity of content, and the financial standings of the parties to the proposed merger.</p><p>Following this examination, I have three options under the legislation, which are to allow the merger to proceed, to allow the merger to proceed with conditions, or to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to conduct a more in-depth, or phase 2, examination of the proposed merger. </p><p>If, following the phase 1 examination, I opt to send a case to the BAI then the BAI will, following its examination of the proposed merger, provide me with a report detailing its recommendations on the matter.  It is also possible for me, as Minister, to establish an advisory panel to provide an opinion to the BAI on the application of the relevant criteria to the media merger in question.</p><p>Following receipt of the BAI's report and recommendations, I must then make a decision either to allow the merger to proceed, to allow it to proceed with conditions or to refuse to grant my consent. </p><p>In accordance with the Guidelines on Media Mergers, my Department facilitates pre-notification meetings with the parties to a proposed media merger.  The purpose of such meetings is to answer questions the parties may have about the media mergers process and the notification form.  A pre-notification meeting was held with the legal representatives of INM and Celtic Media on 22 September 2016.</p></reply>

Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially 1,000 Megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.  This is a solution that will endure for 25 years and beyond and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.  </p>  <p>  &euro;15m has been provided in my Departments Estimates for next year for the for NBP and a further &euro;8m to assist RT&Eacute; in migrating from the 700MHz spectrum band.  Freeing up the 700MHz spectrum band will allow the band be used for advanced mobile services and my Department has already established a working group comprising the Department, RT&Eacute; and ComReg, with a view to advancing this project as a matter of priority. </p>  <p>  In addition to this allocation, last week I signed Regulations which will allow ComReg to proceed with an auction of spectrum within the 3.6GHz band.  This auction will provide an 86% increase in spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless broadband services.</p>  <p>  The &euro;15m for the National Broadband Plan is to provide for early stage mobilisation payments that may be required by the winning bidder(s).  The Government's Capital Investment Plan includes an initial provision of &euro;275m for the NBP up to 2021.  This represents an initial stimulus for the first five years of the NBP intervention, with remaining payments being spread over the full 25 years of the contract.  The amounts required by bidders will only be known after bidders provide their initial estimates of cost and subsidy requirements.</p>  <p>  The procurement process for NBP is ongoing and it is not appropriate to comment any further at this juncture.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-26a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600077#WRA02000"><p>As the waste industry began releasing, in June 2016, its proposed prices under the introduction of a mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure, the Government relayed its concern to the industry regarding the reported escalation of waste bills for customers of certain companies.  On foot of this, my Department engaged with representatives of the waste industry to agree a way forward that results in customers paying no more for the same level of service than they were paying in June 2016, for waste collection over the 12 months to 1 July 2017.</p>  <p>  Regulations were signed on 30 June, 2016 to remove the requirement for mandatory pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection.  However, it is still open to a company to charge on a pay-by-weight basis.  If they are charging the same fee for the same level of service, then this does not run contrary to the agreement. Indeed, many companies already had a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure before the agreement was reached and many of their customers had opted for this approach.  The Irish waste industry were directly involved in the discussions which led to the agreement. Any concerns or evidence of a company breaking the agreement can be brought to my attention or to the attention of my Department officials. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, had designed a public awareness campaign to coincide with the introduction of a mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure.  However, with the removal of mandatory pay-by-weight charging, this campaign was withdrawn.  As previously announced, a review of pay-by-weight is to take place prior to the end of the agreement in July 2017.  Depending on the outcome of this review, a new publicity campaign will be rolled out as appropriate, which will highlight the importance of waste segregation and reduction in light of our need to reduce our reliance on landfill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-26a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600077#WRA02400"><p>I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Mobile operators have, however, invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.</p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically  included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Taskforce has already met 11 times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators. I anticipate that we will bring a report to Government by end 2016, on foot of its work. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is also establishing two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>  I have also secured an &euro;8m provision for RTE in my Department's estimates for 2017 to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to auction this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  I also intend to discuss with ComReg, the possibility of introducing elements within the auction process, which would ensure that blackspots are identified and adequately addressed.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. </p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-26a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016102600077#WRA02700"><p>The Paris Agreement aims to tackle 95% of global emissions through 188 Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the INDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States which commits to 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  The specific details of the contribution to this 40% to be made by each Member State in respect of the non-ETS sector was the subject of a European Commission proposal published on 20 July 2016.  The full implications of this proposal from a domestic perspective are currently being examined.</p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments including the Paris Agreement, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act. </p>  <p>  The overall outcome of the Paris Agreement means that the long-term objective that Ireland has established in the National Policy Position, and underpinned by the Act, namely to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors, as well as pursuing carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land sector, will now be undertaken within a broader international context. </p>  <p>  This means that the more ambitious actions that will be required over time can be taken on the basis of shared experience and co-operation with other States and regions, in the knowledge that all countries will be moving in the same direction, crucial for a small open economy like Ireland's that competes in global markets.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, I intend to make a draft of the first statutory National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017. </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive five-yearly National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the low-carbon transition vision, set out in the policy position, by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 Climate and Energy Package.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan, a draft of which will be published for consultation later this year, will place particular focus on tracking implementation of measures already underway, putting in place the necessary measures to address the challenge to 2020 and also on planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures are in place beyond that.</p></reply>

Emissions from transport, including particulate emissions, can have a detrimental impact on environmental ecosystems and on human health.  Inhalation of Particulate Matter (PM) can increase respiratory morbidity (including exacerbation of existing conditions such as asthma) as well as contributing to cardiovascular disease.</p>  <p>  The European Environment Agency report Air Quality in Europe - 2015, estimated that in Ireland alone 1,200 premature deaths could be attributed to PM2.5, the smallest type of particulate matter that can penetrate deepest into the lungs.  While transport and diesel engines are not the only source of particulate emissions affecting our health, they are a significant contributor in urban areas.  Any practice that exacerbates this situation and the exposure of the population to damaging emissions, including tampering with particulate filters on diesel cars, is of serious concern. </p>  <p>  The management and administration of the national NCT is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I am, of course, conscious of the links across different policy sectors.  With this in mind, my Department is in the process of preparing a paper for consultation on Ireland's first ever national Clean Air Strategy.  The strategy will provide a framework for a formal set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions from all sources, including transport, thereby improving our air quality and public health.  I look forward to engaging with Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his Department through the strategy consultation on any and all practical means of reducing emissions from the transport sector, including any necessary measures to enhance emission abatement checks during the NCT, on-road vehicle testing and the possibility of accessing information in the on-board diagnostic system.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the Effort Sharing Decision and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.     </p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland's emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013-2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e). </p>  <p>  The extent of this challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.   </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the long-term vision of low carbon transition, set out in the National Policy Position, by 2050.

In the event that this would not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.</p></reply>

The preparation of the Plan is statutorily designed to be a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions.  In particular, each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors namely, agriculture, transport, electricity and the built environment is required by Government to develop sectoral mitigation measures for inclusion in the Plan.  </p>  <p>  Development of the National Mitigation Plan is being guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition as set out in the National Policy Position on Climate Action based on: </p>  <p>  -  an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and  </p>  <p>  -  in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  The first iteration of the NMP will focus on tracking implementation of measures already underway, putting in place the necessary measures to address the challenge to 2020 and also to ensure that appropriate policies and measures are in place beyond that.  Work on this task is being co-ordinated by the National Mitigation Plan Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and is well underway by all Departments concerned.  Departments with responsibility for the four largest emitting sectors are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes and financial analysis during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive five-yearly National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low-carbon transition vision by 2050.

In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Taskforce has already met 11 times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, Local Authority engagement, and consumer information/engagement.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves a number of Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and operators and I anticipate we will bring a report to Government by end 2016, on foot of  its work. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government Minister Humphreys is also establishing two regional action groups.  Working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies, these groups will help accelerate local level rollout of broadband and mobile services. </p>  <p>  These new national and local level structures are designed to address as far as possible immediate issues relating to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to increase spectrum available for mobile, nomadic and fixed wireless broadband services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RT&Eacute; in my Department's 2017 estimates to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  These initiatives should significantly enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  I also intend to discuss with ComReg, the possibility of introducing elements within the auction process, which would ensure that blackspots are identified and adequately addressed.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed services throughout Ireland, through private investment and State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated. </p>  <p>  The procurement process to select a contract(s) to deliver the NBP network has commenced and intensive dialogue with the three bidders is currently underway.  Ultimately, this should deliver a solution lasting 25 years and beyond and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

The preparation of the National Mitigation Plan is statutorily designed to be a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions.  In particular, each Minister with responsibility for the largest emitting sectors (namely, agriculture, transport, electricity and the built environment) is required by Government to develop sectoral mitigation measures for inclusion in the Plan.  </p>  <p>  Development of the NMP is being guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition as set out in the National Policy Position, based on: </p>  <p>  - an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and</p>  <p>  - in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive five-yearly NMPs is to incrementally achieve this low-carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the NMP will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 Climate and Energy Package. </p>  <p>  The first iteration of the NMP will place particular focus on tracking implementation of measures already underway, putting in place the necessary measures to address the challenge to 2020 and also on planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures are in place beyond that.  Work on this task is being co-ordinated by the National Mitigation Plan Steering Group, chaired by my Department, and is well underway by all Departments concerned.  In particular, Departments with responsibility for the four largest emitting sectors are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes and financial analysis during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p>  <p>  As stated earlier, I intend to make a draft NMP available for public consultation before the end of the year so as to ensure the views of all stakeholders are considered in taking Ireland's first NMP forward for approval and implementation.</p></reply>

The policy of the global divestment movement is to address some of the root causes of climate change in this manner. </p>  <p>  In an Irish context, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance, holds certain fossil fuel investments inherited from its predecessor, the National Pension Reserve Fund. </p>  <p>  I am advised that these investments are in companies based outside Ireland and, as such, are held in ISIF's global portfolio.  The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest, on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment, in Ireland.</p>  <p>  ISIF's total equity holdings in the Energy sector are valued at &euro;11 million (0.14% of ISIF's assets under management).  ISIF has also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations, representing just over 1% of ISIF's assets.</p>  <p>  As part of its on-going commitment to operate to high international standards ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online at the Strategic Investment Fund website.  The Policy emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into its investment decision making which is in line with the Government's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy, as reflected in the Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Paris Agreement. </p>  <p>  I understand that many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  I am also informed that ISIF, which as I have stated, falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance, continually reviews its investment strategy and, in this regard the issues of decarbonisation and Ireland's long term transition towards a low carbon economy are being considered. </p>  <p>  My Department has not engaged in targeting specific universities or companies to sign up to the global divestment movement.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>The procurement process aims to identify an entity or entities to build, rollout, operate and deliver high speed broadband of at least 30 Megabits per second upload and 6 Megabits per second download speeds to all premises within the intervention area.  The three bidders in the procurement process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland under the National Broadband plan intervention.  Householders and businesses may avail of speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially 1000 Megabits per second, with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.  This is a solution that will endure for 25 years and beyond.  </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Meath.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to </p><p>Over 750,000 premises are currently within the State intervention area.  This includes over 31,000 premises in County Meath.</p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>My Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms service, including parts of Co. Meath.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Taskforce's report.</p><p>I am satisfied that the combination of initiatives to improve wireless services, and the procurement process to deliver a new high speed broadband network under the NBP will put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity, and ensure that high speed broadband services are universally available across the country, including County Meath.</p></reply>

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers as we make this transition. </p>  <p>  By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector are to be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels in line with the EU objective. Fossil fuels will remain a progressively decreasing part of the energy mix as we transition to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, and significant progress is already being made in increasing the share of renewables in that mix.</p>  <p>  In addition to the EU's 2020 targets for emissions reductions, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were from renewable sources at end 2015.  The SEAI analysis also shows that 9.1% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports. </p>  <p>  Government policy will continue to be supportive of the increasing deployment of renewable energy, including offshore renewable energy.  The potential for development of this abundant resource is recognised in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan published in 2014.</p></reply>

The aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in the renewable heating sector and to help reach Ireland's 12% target by 2020.  In 2015, it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D"> </font><font color="#0D0D0D">Over the last few months, the Department has undertaken a detailed economic assessment on the design and cost of the RHI and this work is now almost complete.  Once finalised, there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme, which I anticipate will be published shortly.  Before the RHI is introduced, the overall costs and technologies to be supported will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">I secured &euro;7m funding for the RHI in budget 2017.  This funding was secured based on the expectation that a new scheme will become available in the latter half of 2017.  It is expected that this capital expenditure will need to increase in the coming years to meet our renewable heat target by 2020, and a multiannual budget commitment will be required in the years ahead to ensure certainty for investors in the sector.  This will obviously be subject to discussion and agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The RHI is </font>aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  From a national policy perspective, the focus on the non-ETS sector is likely to accrue a double benefit for the Irish taxpayer, helping to meet our renewable energy target and reduce emissions in the non-ETS sector, simultaneously.</p><p>The analysis suggests that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.  This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector.</p></reply>

Specifically it committed to a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, there have been updates provided in respect of progress.  In April 2014, the Government decided that it needed to scale up the ambition of the plan.  This was a consequence of the mapping process, which had been underway since 2013, and which demonstrated that there was a significant fibre-deficit across Ireland which would require a major network build to address.  It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to allow ESB to enter the telecoms market.  </p><p>Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.3m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 300,000 more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated.  Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012.  At least two operators have announced ambitious fibre-to-the-home rollout plans, one of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy. </p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project.  Since then, my predecessor and I have held media briefings to flag key milestones in the development of the Plan.  These include:</p><p>- November 2014 - the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map and launch of a public consultation<font color="#1F497D">;</font></p><p>- June 2015 - the publication of the draft Intervention Strategy along with 7 expert reports which are supporting the delivery of the procurement; </p><p>- December 2015 - the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and formal launch of the procurement process, with the publication of a detailed Project Information Memorandum and Project Information Notice in the Official Journal of the EU;</p><p>- July 2016 - the decision by Government in relation to the ownership model for the network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies to be brought forward as bidders in the procurement process;</p><p>- July 2016 - the establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  </p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that regular progress reports on the development of the plan, at the key milestone stages outlined, is important in order to inform the public of progress. </p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

However, it is still open to a company to charge on a pay-by-weight basis and if they are charging the same fee for the same level of service then this does not run contrary to the agreement.  Indeed, many companies already had a pay-by-weight element to their charging structure before the agreement was reached and many of their customers had opted for this approach. </p><p>As previously announced, a review of all aspects of pay-by-weight is to take place prior to the end of the agreement in July 2017.</p></reply>

Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 150 will attest later this year. </p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p><p><b>Number of Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will reach Compulsory  Retirement Age 2016 -2018*</b><table><tr><th></th><th><b>31-Dec-2016</b></th><th><b>31-Dec-2017</b></th><th><b>31-Dec-2018</b></th></tr><tr><td>Commissioner</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>D/Commissioner</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A/Commissioner</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>C/Superintendent</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Superintendent</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Inspector</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Sergeant</td><td>1</td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Garda</td><td>2</td><td>38</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>4</td><td>84</td><td>107</td></tr></table>*as of 17 October 2016</p></reply>

Persons who are currently in another EU Member State, including those in the camps in Calais and elsewhere, and who are in need of international protection, are entitled to make an application for asylum in that country, should they wish to do so.  We also need to bear in mind that a defining characteristic of the migrants and asylum seekers who have gathered in Calais, including unaccompanied minors, has been their very strong desire to go to the UK as their ultimate destination and that this is unlikely to change.  In that respect, as I have previously stated, I do not see that a unilateral initiative from Ireland would be appropriate in this case, not least given the fact that this is a delicate situation involving the borders between two other Member States.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that in recent days the French authorities have commenced the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers from Calais to accommodation centres in various regions of France in advance of the closure of the Calais camp.  I understand that this is being done to protect the security of the people of Calais, to maintain public order and to ensure dignified conditions for the migrants and refugees currently resident in the Calais camp, including unaccompanied minors.</p>  <p>  As detailed in my response to Question Number 55 of 16 September 2016 from the Deputy, Ireland has agreed to accept unaccompanied children through the Relocation strand of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme concerns the relocation of asylum seekers from Italy and Greece and resettlement under the UNHCR-led programme which is currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon.</p></reply>

Section 2 of the Act sets out the criteria for use of reasonable force in such circumstances.  The householder must believe that the intruder has entered the dwelling to commit a criminal act.  The force used against the intruder must only be such as is reasonable in the circumstances as the householder believes them to be, to protect people in the dwelling from assault, to protect property, to prevent the commission of a crime or to make a lawful arrest.  Section 2(4) provides that it is a matter for a court or jury to decide whether the householder's belief with regard to the amount of force used was honestly held and provides as follows:</p><p><i>&quot;It is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held but in considering whether the person using the force honestly held the belief, the court or jury, as the case may</i><i>be, shall have regard to the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the person so believing and all other relevant circumstances.&quot;</i></p></reply>

No estimate of the cost of a further backdating to 1 January has been completed as to extend eligibility for the scheme further back than the date of its initial announcement would consist entirely of deadweight. Individuals who purchased new homes since the start of the year did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit.

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p>  <p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2016/2017 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0035/2016 which issued on 20 May 2016 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0035_2016.pdf</p>  <p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0035/2016 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (IMPACT and SIPTU).</p>  <p>  My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. </p></reply>

In 2017 an additional &euro;36.5 million will be made available with &euro;160 million additional over the next three years. This will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning. Among those who will benefit from the additional  third level funding being made available are, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents and Travellers.</p>  <p>  It is also intended to carry out a policy review in order to implement a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.

The plan is expected to include targeted measures in the area of:</p><p>-  School leadership</p><p>-  School networks and clusters</p><p>-  Teaching methodologies</p><p>-  Integration of schools and other State supports within communities</p><p>-  Greater use of Home School Community Liaison services</p><p>As you know no new school has been included in DEIS since 2009, now a new assessment framework is being developed using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of new schools for inclusion. The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating in DEIS. It will not be necessary for schools to make an application.</p><p>While we await the outcome of the identification process, it is not my intention to change the DEIS status of any school including Mary Queen of Ireland National School.

Most CE participants in the childcare programme are working to achieve the relevant FETAC level 5 or level 6 qualifications.

A breakdown of this number into those who have already obtained a Level 5 in Childcare is not available.</p>  <p>  The childcare ratios and qualification requirements of those employed in childcare are a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE.

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  </p>  <p>  For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable.  Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, the first &euro;75 a week together with 25% of any additional maintenance above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes.  Any changes to the conditions of the rent supplement scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  The Department's overall strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose, short-term income support, by transferring responsibility for persons with long-term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  </p></reply>

It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The UK claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.</p>  <p>  While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed or to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.</p>  <p>  During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;  Rockall falls into precisely this category.  </p>  <p>  In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from a state's coast, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.  </p>  <p>  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  The 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore submitted the national claim for this area at the end of March 2009, as did the British Government in respect of the UK's claim.  Denmark submitted its claim on behalf of the Faroe Islands in 2010.  Iceland has not made a submission to date.</p>  <p>  The Commission's rules of procedure prevent consideration by the Commission of a submission relating to a disputed area without the consent of all the states concerned and Iceland does not currently consent to the consideration of these submissions.  The submission within the deadline preserved the State's legal position and since then the Government has continued to work for the creation of conditions that will permit its consideration as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Following a request from GCC, OPW recently confirmed its agreement in principle to the advancement of a potential scheme for the Gort Lowlands and to provide any technical assistance that GCC may require as the Council will be acting as the Contracting Authority for this project.</p>  <p>  Once the tendering processes for the required design and environmental consultants have been completed it is expected that the Council will revert to the OPW in relation to specific funding requests, before entering into any contractual agreements.  If approved, funding will be provided to the Council for the appointment of the consultants to develop solutions to deal with the flooding problem and to undertake any surveys which may be required.</p>  <p>  OPW will consider any request from the Council for funding to procure the services of a project engineer specifically for this project as the development of a scheme will be complex due to the particular geological and ecological characteristics of the area.  Subject to a viable scheme emerging which is both cost beneficial and environmentally acceptable and which meets with general public acceptance, the Council may request confirmation of funding arrangements from OPW to undertake its construction.</p>  <p>  As part of the investigation into the problem there will be significant consultation with statutory bodies and the general public during the course of the scheme development where input and knowledge from the local community will be considered very important.  If a viable solution emerges it will have to be brought forward through planning either under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts or the Planning and Development Regulations at which stage the public will have every opportunity to make further submissions on the proposals.</p>  <p>  Engineering measures/options to alleviate localised flooding in the Kiltartan area including a recent proposal to install a new culvert directly from Kiltartan River to Coole River, can be considered as part of the strategic approach by GCC to examine options for a Flood Relief Scheme for the Gort Lowlands area as a whole.</p></reply>

Section 55 provides that the HSE may provide private in-patient services to persons who are not entitled to, or who do not have or have waived eligibility to public in-patient services. An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital. </p>  <p>  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. The application of a charge by a hospital for private in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, as it relates to the private service provided. Where private in-patient services are provided the daily private patient charges that apply will depend on the category of hospital (Schedule 5 or 6 of the Health Act) and whether the overnight accommodation was in a single or multi-occupancy room.</p></reply>

The NHSPWD has been affirmed in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and has been extended to 2020 to deliver on its aims and will continue to guide and progress policy.</p>  <p>  At national level, my Department, DHPCLG, the HSE, the Housing Agency and the disability sector work together on an ongoing basis, in a structured framework, supported by the Housing Agency chaired Subgroup and Task Groups reporting to it.</p>  <p>  Under the NHSPWD, policy on decongregation of institutions is a matter for the Department of Health.  The HSE's report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;,(2011) proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community.  The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE.  This will ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. </p>  <p>  Further to this capital funding, the HSE's Service Reform Fund 2016-2019 will provide funding of &euro;45 million to support the phased transition to person-centred model of supports and services over the coming years.  This transitional funding of &euro;45 million represents a combined investment by the Department of Health (&euro;30 million) and Atlantic Philanthropies (&euro;15 million), with the support of the HSE and Genio.  The fund will focus on the reconfiguration of residential services and will assist in meeting the costs of migration to a person-centred model of services and supports</p>  <p>  In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The German court requested a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice, which determined that the Government-regulated minimum pricing system interfered with free trade, as it provided more of an obstacle to pharmacies outside Germany than to those within Germany. </p>  <p>  Ireland does not use a fixed minimum pricing structure for prescription medicines and, in line with a previous European Court of Justice ruling, does not permit mail order pharmacy sales. Accordingly, the Court's ruling does not appear to hold direct relevance for our community drug schemes.  However, my officials will continue to monitor the issue. </p></reply>

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and there are approximately 70 deaths per year.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  I want to provide assurances to these young women and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The HSE are currently developing a care pathway for young people who are experiencing these types of symptoms and will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services tailored to the needs of each individual.</p>  <p>  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition.</p>  <p>  The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil and over 220,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.  Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.</p>  <p>  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information and I would encourage all young women to receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In June 2011 the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings&rdquo; was published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which identified that in 2008 approximately 4000 individuals with disabilities lived in congregated type settings.  These are places where ten or more people reside in a single living unit or are campus based.  It found that, notwithstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, and lived their lives apart from any community and family.</p>  <p>  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  St John of God Services in Kerry has been identified as one of the priority sites for de-congregation.  The HSE is committed to working with St John of God Services to transition 17 residents in ward style accommodation from the current unsuitable accommodation on campus to more appropriate settings in the local community.  Comprehensive transition plans will ensure that there is extensive engagement with the person themselves, their families, carers and advocates, as well as the service provider, to ensure successful and sustainable transitions into the community.</p>  <p>  Some of the existing residents will benefit from greater opportunities to participate in local communities and will, over time and with proper planning, move to living in the community.  The welfare and dignity of residents is absolutely paramount, and the needs of the individual will be the first consideration.</p>  <p>  I would particularly like to assure any concerned residents or family members that the process of moving a person with disabilities out of a congregated setting is not something that happens overnight.  This process of moving people to more suitable accommodation in the community will take place over a number of years, and will be done in full consultation with all residents, advocates and their families.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Existing policy is set out in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (2014) which established a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of mitigation and adaptation plans to enable the State to pursue the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050 (known as the &lsquo;<i>national transition objective&rsquo;</i>).  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 established the national transition objective on a statutory basis and in order to facilitate the transition, provided,<i>inter alia</i>, for the development and submission to Government for approval of national mitigation plans and national adaptation frameworks. </p><p>Development work on the first mitigation plan and adaptation framework is progressing and is being co-ordinated by my  Department through national mitigation and national adaptation steering committees.  Both committees are chaired by the Department and include membership from the relevant sectors as well as the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, EPA, SEAI, NewEra and the local government sector.  Work generally on the national transition objective is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council, as appropriate.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group.  </p><p>Policy in relation to tackling both the mitigation and adaptation aspects of climate change in Ireland has been in development for a number of years, having regard to EU and international obligations, national policy and the recent legislative provisions referred to earlier.  Taken together, these and other measures, including the mainstreaming of climate change considerations into policies and operations across different sectors and the National Dialogue on Climate Change, form part of a long-term strategy to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors and carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land sector.  They will also assist our towns and cities to adapt to the future impacts that climate change will bring and ultimately build a level of climate resilience that society will require in the future. </p></reply>

Essentially, EirGrid develops, manages and operates the electricity transmission grid and this brings power from where it is generated to where it is needed throughout Ireland.</p><p>In working towards an ever more efficient, more effective and more economic electricity network, it is necessary to carry out grid refurbishment and enhancement on an ongoing basis.  This can affect landowners, homeowners and communities near new transmission lines.</p><p>EirGrid is aware of the inconvenience and interruption not only on farm activity due to the construction of new pylons on a farm, but also the impact on communities who host the infrastructure. They also acknowledge that there are some restrictions on land use at the site of individual pylons. </p><p>  Hence, in recognition of the potential impact of transmission infrastructure, EirGrid has a range of &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; payments in place.  The categories are, flexibility of access, loss of development rights, loss of tree planting rights and impacts on farming.  EirGrid also has a range of &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; and &ldquo;community&rdquo; payments in place. It is difficult to provide specific details because each case is assessed on its own merits and consequently compensation rates will vary. However, the flexibility of access category is of most relevance to the question. Payments vary, but for instance, in 2009 a provision was agreed for staged payments of &euro;11,000 per double wood pole set and &euro;22,000 per mast (steel lattice tower) in relation to the construction of a number of new 110kV overhead transmission lines. </p><p>EirGrid will be happy to provide more details via their Communications Department.  I should also point out that ESB Networks also manage a system of annual payments for farmers where their normal farming practices are affected by the presence of masts on their lands.</p></reply>

Budget 2017 has provided over &euro;100 million to support energy projects.  This funding will be split between supporting the existing energy efficiency programmes and rolling out a series of new initiatives and pilots that can lay the foundation for increased investment in future years which will also support employment in the sector. </p>  <p>  Figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2015 show that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources.  In addition, SEAI has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.8% of heat and 5.7% of transport were met from renewable sources.  </p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  </p>  <p>  Funding of support schemes under the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy also supports employment in the renewable energy industry. </p></reply>

Approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to over 90% of the population. </p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30Mbps but up to 1Gbps with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect the Taskforce to report by end 2016. </p>  <p>  &euro;15m has been provided for the NBP in my Departments Estimates for 2017 to provide for early stage mobilisation payment that may be required by winning bidder(s).   I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE  which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity. </p>  <p>  Licences issues by ComReg impose binding conditions, including quality of service and coverage obligations, on Telecommunications Network Operators.  Therefore regulatory issues surrounding  mobile phone network coverage and quality are  statutory functions of the Independent Regulator ComReg.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the independent statutory body responsible for protecting the environment in Ireland. The EPA performs a wide range of statutory functions in fulfilment of its mandate.</p><p>For example, the EPA has a key role in licensing facilities with the potential for significant environmental pollution, to ensure that their emissions do not endanger human health or harm the environment. The EPA is responsible for issuing Industrial Emission Directive Licenses; Integrated Pollution and Control (IPC) Licenses; Waste Licences; Waste Water Discharge Authorisations; Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Authorisations; and Radiological Protection Licences.</p><p>The EPA also encourages participation in its regulatory activities, through providing input to its decision making processes and reporting any negative environmental impacts from facilities that it licences such as odours, noise or water pollution. Currently there are approximately 800 industrial and waste facilities operating under EPA Licences.</p><p>While overall compliance with EPA Licences is good, the EPA's Office of Environmental Enforcement introduced a new methodology in 2015 for risk-ranking National Priority Sites which takes account of enforcement performance, giving a timely, dynamic and accurate picture of where regulatory responses should be directed. </p><p>It is recognised by the EPA that many pollution problems such as air quality, water pollution, odours and noise tend to be localised and can be masked by national level assessments. These localised problems can have severe impacts on the health and well-being of the people in individual communities and on the quality of the local environment. Making the link between environment and health is, therefore, of critical importance in both understanding and dealing with these problems.  Targeting actions in the right places is also of critical importance to the EPA in addressing the problems in both an effective and efficient manner, and they are placing a particular focus on any licensed industrial, waste and waste water facilities creating nuisance for adjacent communities. </p><p>EPA prosecutions are particularly focussed on priority sites and issues. In 2015, the EPA conducted over 1,300 site visits at licensed facilities and 15 prosecutions were heard resulting in total fines and costs of over &euro;20 million. 9 prosecutions were heard in the District Court in the first half of 2016, with summary proceedings progressing in relation to 19 sites.  </p><p>The EPA operates in a transparent and open manner, publishing comprehensive details about its activities. A wealth of further information is therefore available to the public on www.epa.ie.</p><p>I have secured an additional &euro;2m for the EPA in my Department's estimates for 2017 to, <i>inter alia, </i>support its enforcement activities. </p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.</p>  <p>  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, primarily based on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2014 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in September 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to the more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health and the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated reference levels.</p>  <p>  The report indicates that NOx values, arising primarily from the transport sector, are showing a slight increase over 2013 figures at some locations, and indicates a risk that growth in economic activity will lead to an increase in NOx levels.  Similarly, the report indicates that levels of particulates (PM2.5) and compounds (PAH) have increased at some stations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these issues, I welcome the fact that no levels above the EU limit value were recorded at any of the ambient air quality network monitoring sites in Ireland in 2014.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in some areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, consumers must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that this choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.</p>  <p>  A new national update on air quality 2015 will be available later this year.  Meanwhile, following a comprehensive review of the current status of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland, a new national ambient air quality monitoring programme is proposed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, to strengthen the capacity and capability to provide more comprehensive, localised air quality information linked to public health advice. The EPA is currently running a public consultation on this and my Department intends to participate fully in the consultation and follow up actions as appropriate.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable energy sources, with the latter target also being legally binding.</p><p>Currently, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is approximately 2,800 MW, of which over 2,500 MW is wind.  EirGrid has forecasted in its &quot;All-island Generation Capacity Statement 2016-2025&quot; that between 3,800 and 4,100 MW of wind generating capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity.</p><p>The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  The Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  In 2015, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 25.3% of electricity was generated by renewable sources, of which 22.8% was generated by onshore wind. </p><p>My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  In-depth economic analysis is under way to inform the actual cost of a new scheme and, while no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of a variety of technologies are being examined as part of the assessment process.</p><p>Once the detailed economic analysis is complete, there will be an additional public consultation phase on the design of the new scheme.  The details of this will be advertised on my Department's website, .  The introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland's emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013-2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).</p>  <p>  The extent of this challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.</p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the long-term vision of low carbon transition, set out in the National Policy Position, by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.</p></reply>

It will open access to public procurements opportunities, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  It is a matter of regret that one Member State was not in a position to approve the provisional application of this Agreement.  CETA has the potential to provide new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.</p><p>The draft Council on the provisional application of CETA is publicly available through the website of the Council of the European Union .  The deputy will note from the draft decision that it is not proposed to provisionally apply investment protection or investment dispute resolution provisions.  Provisional application is a standard process in Free Trade Agreements which provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the EU has competence.  Provisional application will not apply to those areas over which Member States have competence.  Accordingly, I support provisional application as I am keen to see Irish firms enjoy the tariff free benefits and new business opportunities as soon as possible.</p><p>The full entering into force of the agreement will be subject, in the first instance, to a decision by the EU, through a Council decision with the consent of the Parliament, and secondly by the approval of all Member States through the relevant national ratification procedures.  In this regard, D&aacute;il Eireann will be a part of the final decision to ratify CETA in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution.</p><p>To meet the political concerns of certain Member States, the EU and Canada developed a legally binding Joint Interpretative Declaration to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  </p><p>Article 7 of the Aarhus Convention requires Parties to provide public participation during preparation of plans, programmes and policies relating to the environment.  CETA does not give the EU or Canada the power to change each other's regulations, nor prevent either from introducing new environmental legislation.</p></reply>

Of the remainder, a significant number operate as sole traders.  As such, it is not the case that low wages in the sector are caused primarily by a drive for excessive profits.  However a greater understanding of the current components of cost is required to develop appropriate policy in this regard.  The Programme for Government commits to conducting and publishing an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare in Ireland.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme, which I announced in Budget 2017, and is currently being progressed in that context.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that the review will consider (1) the total average cost of quality childcare provision, (2) variation in cost and the reasons for same, (3) the link between cost and quality, (4) the cost of providing childcare services in disadvantaged communities and (5) the likely impact of future cost pressures, including the ongoing professionalisation of the sector.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the Department will tender for independent expertise to conduct the review in the autumn with a view to ensuring that the review is commenced later this year.  </p>  <p>  Childcare providers set their own fees, and there is no current plan for the Government to control fees, which would be a major intrusion in the market and could, if not managed carefully and appropriately, create risks around the viability and quality of childcare provision.  My Department is committed to developing quality, affordable childcare through state subsidised schemes such as ECCE and the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will be introduced from September 2017, ensuring that a greater number of children will benefit from state funded childcare. </p></reply>
