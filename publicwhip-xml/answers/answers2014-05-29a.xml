Commensurate with the level of funding set aside for the Scheme, applications were assessed on a top down basis in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the Circular accompanying the Scheme.  At a time of limited resources, it was necessary to prioritise works in this manner.  However, in accordance with the Scheme's Circular, applications from schools in categories 7 to 10 will be retained and will be prioritised for consideration under further rounds of the Summer Works Scheme in the future, subject to availability of funding.</p></reply>

This has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth.  It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size.</p><p>  It is important to point out that within the schools sector we know from international research that while class sizes is a factor the quality of teaching is a far more significant factor in determining outcomes.  In terms of international comparison, the last published statistics by the OECD show Ireland's PTR at slightly above the OECD average and average class size at primary level at 23.9 compared to an OECD average of 21.3.</p></reply>

I have asked the NCSE to provide me with Policy advice on the education of children with Autism and I expect this advice in the Spring of 2015.  This advice will inform the development of future policy. </p><p>  The report to which the Deputy refers was commissioned by the NCSE and undertaken by researchers at the ESRI and Trinity College.  The NCSE has advised that the views and opinions in the report are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the Council.  The NCSE provided policy advice to me in 2011 on the future role of special schools and special classes including ASD units which advised that the composition of special classes should be determined in response to the needs of children with special educational needs.  Neither report indicates that the absence of a single policy document on the education of children with autism negatively impacted on education provision for these children.</p></reply>

My officials have already consulted with school Management Bodies prior to issuing the circular and is currently setting up further meetings with Management Bodies and Parent representative groups to allay any fears. </p><p>  There are currently some 10,965 posts available for allocation of which 10,656 SNA posts are currently allocated, which is more than at any time previously.  This means that - rather than a reduction of SNA posts - there is provision for a further 309 posts to be allocated to schools to end-December 2014.  These extra posts will ensure the Government's policy of ensuring every child assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to support.  Implementation of the circular should ensure that children's care needs are better understood so that SNAs can work more effectively to assist children in their care.</p></reply>

However the NCCA will trial the specifications, particularly in the context of the proposed new practical examination.  It is expected that these science specifications will not only attract more higher level students but, for Physics, it is hoped that it will  also attract more girls and more students to study Physics at Ordinary level.  </p><p>  The NCCA has commenced its consideration of Applied Mathematics.  It is intended  to issue a background paper for consultation in the autumn.  The findings of the  consultation process will inform the way forward for Applied Mathematics.  Currently few Leaving Certificate candidates opt to study Applied Mathematics.   </p><p>  The STEM sector needs second level students with a scientific and mathematics  background - both for those young people who intend to enter Higher Education and study in this area and also for those who intend to  follow NFQ level 6 and 7 programmes.</p></reply>

Children with specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia, as well as those with physical conditions, are accommodated in the examinations under the SEC's scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at the Certificate Examinations (RACE Scheme).  However, the existence of a specific learning difficulty does not automatically make a candidate eligible to avail of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling, they may not require the provision of any special accommodations provided that they can read the examination papers at the required level and write legibly.</p><p>  Appeals against any aspect of the SEC's decision on RACE applications can be made to an Appeals Committee which is independent of the SEC.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in reviewing decisions on RACE made by the SEC or the Independent Appeals Committee.</p></reply>

Some parents of young children with autism, who are eligible for home tuition, requested that my Department accommodate the tuition being provided in a group setting offered by private providers.  My Department has facilitated direct payment arrangements with a small number of private pre-school providers, subject to agreed terms and conditions.  My Department's Inspectorate has engaged with one of the private pre-school providers and planning for future engagement with the preschools, to include the primary teachers employed by them, will be undertaken by officials of my Department.  Private providers are required to comply with the terms of the Home Tuition scheme insofar as it requires that the tuition must be provided by a qualified teacher. </p><p>  Given that the private providers have been selected by parents, it is open to any parent to revert to Home Tuition in the event that they are in any way dissatisfied with the service provided.</p></reply>

The first meeting was held in February, 2014.  Most schools that intend to submit appeals generally do so for the February meeting of the Appeals Board.  This gives schools an early opportunity to have their appeals heard.</p><p>  The second meeting of the Appeals Board is normally held in June.  This year it will be held on 10 June 2014.  The issue of an earlier timeframe for this meeting has not been raised by education partners in their regular discussions with my Department.  My Department is open to facilitating the appeals meeting being brought forward into May.  My Department will discuss this further with education partners as part of its normal engagement with them in the Autumn on the teacher allocation and redeployment process for the 2015/16 school year.</p></reply>

Accordingly the accompanying circular allowed schools a period up to the Easter break of this year to make the necessary arrangements, including consultations with the school community, for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy which fully complies with the requirements of the procedures. </p><p>  My Department's Inspectorate will now, as part of its inspection of schools, be specifically examining schools compliance with the new anti-bullying procedures including the actions taken to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  While the newspaper article is a cause of concern, the work of the Department's Inspectorate in the school inspection process will give a better overview on how well the new procedures are being implemented at school level.  This is an issue that parents and parent associations can also raise directly with their school.</p></reply>

I have stated that my aim in bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to school admission is to improve the admissions process and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  The framework also proposes a mechanism for ensuring that every child receives a school place.  The draft General Scheme for an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, 2013 and draft regulations are published on my Department's website.  The Government gave approval in March for drafting the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014 and the General Scheme has since been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for drafting. </p><p>  In relation to the UK approach, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the availability in the UK of an online map facility which, upon entering a person's postcode, identifies the schools that include that particular postcode area within their catchment area.  The Department understands that this facility simply provides information to parents and others about those schools which enrol children from a particular area but does not in itself guarantee a place or put any obligation on schools in relation to the use of catchment areas.</p><p>  Regarding the use of catchment area as an oversubscription criteria, it should be noted that the approach in the draft regulations published alongside the Draft General Scheme was to specify certain oversubscription criteria which would not be permissible.  Otherwise the draft regulations provide that schools would have discretion to determine their own oversubscription criteria, including whether to apply a catchment area.</p></reply>

Launched in 2010, it is part of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  Under the Europe 2020 strategy, Ireland has signed up to a national headline target to reduce early school leaving to 8%, and to increase the number of 30-34 year olds with tertiary education to 60% by 2020.  Ireland provides annual updates to the European Commission on this target as part of the National Reform Programme (NRP) process.  According to the latest data available, Ireland's early school leaving rate was 9.7% in 2012, down from 11.4% in 2010.  The latest data also shows that Ireland's tertiary attainment rate for 30-34 year olds was 51.1% in 2012, up from 49.7% in 2011.

This gives schools greater autonomy to determine how they deploy their teaching resources across the competing needs of the school.  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  Wherever possible, group work and class based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils that are in most need of one to one support. </p><p>  While the school's guidance planning should involve and, where appropriate, be led by the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play.  Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process.  Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance:</p><p>- Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings</p><p>- Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal) </p><p>- Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff</p><p>- Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools</p><p>- Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis and </p><p>- Refer students with particular difficulties to outside experts who are specialists in particular relevant areas</p><p>  In February the Department published a guide to developing student support teams in post primary schools.  This is an important resource for schools in promoting and protecting students' well-being and an aid to establishing a team or reviewing an existing team.  I am confident schools act in the best interests of students when determining how best to use the teaching resources available to them.</p></reply>

In light of the very difficult economic situation and the significant costs involved, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.</p><p>In 2012, my Department requested the NCSE to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE Report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  While the report recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible, the report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term. </p><p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has made a number of recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.  It also recommends that under a proposed new allocation model, all children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  The Chairperson of the Working Group which was established to develop proposals for a new resource allocation model, submitted its report to me on 5th March and I am considering the report's recommendations.</p></reply>

Its financial position was not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Setanta was regulated at EU level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law and was therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders before this development. </p><p>  The Central Bank was notified by the MFSA on 16 April that the shareholders of Setanta had resolved to wind up the company.  The effect of this was that  Setanta did not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.  Consequently Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and Mr Paul Mercieca was appointed as Liquidator.  It should be noted that the option of placing the company into administration as happened to Quinn Insurance - thus supporting the operation of the business on a going concern and safeguarding the interests of all policyholders - is not an option available under Maltese law. </p><p>  My officials have been in discussions with the Central Bank of Ireland, the MFSA and with the Setanta Liquidator and I have asked them to convey my wish that every effort is made to facilitate Setanta policyholders in obtaining new motor insurance policies and in understanding their overall position.  Furthermore the Central Bank continues to have ongoing contact with the MFSA and with the Liquidator of Setanta on a range of matters.  </p><p>  My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt, though it should be said that because most of the relevant legislation is EU determined there may be limits on what can be done in the short-term.  Because of this however  the matter has also been raised with the European Commission and it has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory and legislative framework require action.  In this regard, it should be noted that with the introduction of the more risk sensitive Solvency II from 1 January 2016,  there should be less likelihood of this type of situation arising in the future.</p></reply>

Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority.  The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking. </p><p>  Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State (its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State.  The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake.  The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.  Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is also required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement.  In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.  Where a non-life undertaking authorised in another Member State goes into liquidation and policyholders in relation to risks in this State are affected, the Accountant of the High Court can make an application to the High Court on their behalf, under the Insurance Compensation Fund and, subject to certain exclusions, can distribute sums due to such policyholders from the ICF.</p><p>  EEA insurance regulators are also members of EIOPA (European Insurance &amp;amp; Occupational Pension Authority) and are required to comply with the General Protocol relating to the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities of the Member States of the European Union.  This general protocol statement was issued in 2008 and is currently under review by EIOPA.  Setanta Insurance was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I and I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework.  The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors. </p><p>  My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.  The European Commission has also indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.</p></reply>

The day to day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions.  The decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved and a need to ensure adequate provisioning for future losses.  The Central Bank has no remit over the pricing of insurance products.  Competent Authorities are specifically restricted from interfering in the pricing of insurance products under the various European insurance directives.</p><p>  The legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives.  As such, Member States, such as Ireland, are limited in terms of the matters for which provision may be made in national legislation.  That framework expressly prohibits Member States adopting provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters including general and special policy conditions, scales of premiums and, for life insurance, technical bases used for calculating scales of premiums.  Furthermore, in the context of non-life insurance, that framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums, as has been acknowledged in case law by the ECJ (Case C-518/06).  In this regard, Member States cannot require non-life insurance undertakings to make prior notification or seek prior approval of proposed increases in premium rates, except as part of general a price-control system. </p><p>  Insurance undertakings carrying on business in Member States, including Ireland, are required by the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives, as transposed into national law, to establish and maintain technical reserves, an adequate solvency margin and a minimum guarantee fund.  Compliance by an insurer with those requirements, which are important financial indicators of an insurer, are designed with policyholders in mind.</p></reply>

While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland, the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.  The Central Bank is in contact with the MFSA in relation to Setanta Insurance Company Limited, the impact on policyholders and the provision for relevant and appropriate information.</p><p>Setanta was regulated at EU regulatory level in accordance with a directive known as Solvency I which currently places requirements on the amount of regulatory capital European insurance companies must hold against unforeseen events.  I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU law is, therefore, entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following negotiations that were completed at European level in November, 2013, a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework.  The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors. </p><p>My Department and the Central Bank will be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.  The European Commission has indicated that it will also review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.  </p><p>On 16 April 2014, the MFSA determined that the company was insolvent.  This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.  Setanta was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and Mr Paul Mercieca was appointed as Liquidator.  Officials from my Department together with officials from the Central Bank met with the Liquidator and his representatives in Ireland on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders.  The Liquidator confirmed that all policyholders who have not already done so should arrange alternative cover without delay as claims are unlikely to be paid in full and he has issued letters to policyholders informing them that their insurance cover will be cancelled within 7 to 10 days, in accordance with their policy documents.  This process has commenced and there were less than 20,000 policies with Setanta Insurance on 27 May.  It is expected that all remaining policies will be cancelled this week in line with the terms of the policies.  In the circumstances, I continue to strongly advise policyholders to make alternative insurance arrangements without delay and that they should contact their insurance broker or an insurer directly to seek alternative cover.  This is also the advice of the Central Bank.</p><p>The provision of motor insurance cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the making of adequate provisioning to meet these risks.  In my role as the Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  The Liquidator has advised that arrangements are in hand for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonuses&quot; certificates from Setanta.  Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates will be honoured by other insurers and we are aware that many insurers are being flexible surrounding requirements for documents.  In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement' is available to policyholders of Setanta.  The current Declined Cases Agreement was drawn up in 1981 and is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland.  I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  I understand that Insurance Ireland is also making information available to those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through their service at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .</p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.  My officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.</p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this county must, by law, be members of MIBI and contribute to the funding of claims in proportion to their market share.  The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.  However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).</p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the ICF.  All ICF payments are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.  The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI.  However, unpaid premium would fall to be claimed from the Setanta Liquidator in due course.</p></reply>

GAM resources also provide for the provision of English Additional Language support.</p><p>  Details of the manner in which GAM resources have been allocated to schools for the 2013/14 school year are set out in my Departments Circular 0013/2013.  This Circular sets out that resources are allocated to schools based on the number of mainstream class teaching posts in each school in the preceding year, which are themselves based on school enrolments.  The GAM is updated for schools annually based on the number of mainstream teaching posts in each school in the preceding year and based on the provisions set out in Circular 0013/2013.  Once these resources have been allocated to schools, it is a matter for schools to then determine the manner in which these resource teaching/learning support resources are utilised to provide additional teaching support to eligible pupils.  Guidance to support schools in this regard is set out in my Departments Circular 02/05. </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs has recommended that a proposed new allocation model be developed for schools whereby a quantum of additional special educational needs resource teaching support would be allocated to schools based on the profiled need of each school.  The NCSE established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Allocation Model based on the educational profile of all schools, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.  The Report of this Working group has been submitted to my Department and is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

The education and training system engages with employers at national, regional and local levels, as well as at institutional and programme level.  National engagement with Employers: An Enterprise Engagement Forum, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, provides a regular opportunity for the major organisations representing enterprise and employers in Ireland to input to and discuss interests and concerns relevant to education and training policy and provision. </p><p>  The first National Employers Survey was undertaken in 2012, led by the HEA and IBEC.  75% of employers expressed confidence that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and the relevant knowledge in their subject and discipline.  The second round of this survey will be carried out in 2014 as a joint action by the HEA and SOLAS.  My Department also funds the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which advises on future skills needs and emerging gaps.  Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, e.g. Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion initiative, which was introduced as part of the ICT Action Plan.  The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise.  Furthermore, SOLAS has inherited a wide range of employer connections from its predecessor, FAS, including the structures established to manage apprenticeship.  It has informal and formal links with employers at both a national and local level.  These links will be maintained as well as developing strong local engagement through the Education and Training Board (ETB) structures.</p><p>  The development of the Further Education and Training Strategy by SOLAS will further progress the overall architecture for engagement with employers at a national level.  The development of the strategy was informed by formal consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including employers and employer representative bodies.  The strategy includes significant references to enhancing employer engagement and the critical importance of matching FET provision with labour market needs.</p><p>  The alignment of ETB education and training programmes with evolving labour market needs will also continue to be evidence-based.  This is facilitated by SOLAS' internal resource namely, the National Skills Database (NSD), as well as research by the EGFSN and other relevant sources.  Since its development, the database has been used to support the work of the EGFSN, the National Skills Strategy and numerous sectoral studies.  The NSD has been extended to include an occupational employment forecasting model originally developed by F&Aacute;S and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  The data held in the database is summarised and published in three annual reports by the EGFSN: National Skills Bulletin (since 2005), Monitoring Ireland's Skills Supply: Trends in Education/Training Outputs (since 2006) and the Vacancy Overview (since March 2011).  </p><p>  Engagement with enterprise is also a core mission of the higher education system.  The HEA is committed to developing a new over-arching strategy and framework for HE-enterprise engagement by the end of 2014.  This will set performance indicators and measures to benchmark engagement and entrepreneurial education activity in Irish higher education and will put in place a systemic mapping of activity. </p><p>  Local employer engagement: Decisions around course provision at further education level are based on formal and informal contacts at both national and local level with employers and other relevant state agencies.  A variety of data is taken into account including expected recruitment demand from new or expanding companies and requests from employers to the ETBs to develop training programmes to supply them with skilled workers.  In addition, the success of existing courses in terms of job placement, course waiting lists and the job vacancy databank provide valuable insights into the type of training that is likely to prove relevant and effective for both learners and employers.  Higher Education institutions also engage with enterprise at a local level with a view to the development of programmes tailored to local enterprise needs as well as arranging appropriate work placements etc.  There are many examples of this engagement nationwide.</p><p>  Engagement at education and training programme level: The Apprenticeship programme, the ICT Action Plan, Springboard (including the ICT Conversion Programmes), Momentum and the training provision facilitated by Skillnets all have a high level of employer engagement.  The education and training sector is also continuing to work to meet other areas of demand from enterprise &ndash; e.g. STEM internship programme.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school.  I expect that statistics for the current school year, 2013/14 will be published shortly.  The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year.  The national average class size is 24.7 pupils.  However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level.  My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p><p>  The context for any discussion about PTR or class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.  The Government will continue to protect front-line services as best as possible.  However, it is important to note that all public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our schools cannot be exempt from this requirement. </p><p>  Within the schools sector we know from international research that while class sizes is a factor the quality of teaching is a far more significant factor in determining outcomes.  We therefore have to focus on the drivers of good performance.  We need to have the right people becoming teachers.  We need the right training for them in College.  We need to support them with the right professional development throughout their career.  To this end we are making significant changes to both the structure and format of initial teacher education so that our colleges and teachers are comparable with the best in the world.</p></reply>

A variety of sources are used in this analysis, including census data, school enrolment data, and child benefit data obtained from the Department of Social Protection.  Total pupil enrolment at primary school level is expected to increase by approximately 70,000 up to 2019.  At post-primary level, total pupil enrolment is expected to increase by approximately 35,000 over the same period, and continuing increases at this level are expected up until 2026 at least.</p><p>  In June 2011, I announced the provision of 20 new primary schools and some 20 new post-primary schools up to 2017 to meet demographic need.  Some of these schools have commenced operation with the remainder will be commencing by 2016.  In addition, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The Five Year Plan is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan.  My Department will also consider applications from schools for funding for additional classrooms where an immediate enrolment need is arising.</p><p>  My Department continues to analyse demographic trends and to monitor enrolments in all areas to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required into the future and to ensure that this is provided in a timely manner.</p></reply>

As a result of the most recent framework that has been put in place the number of service providers to the Schools Broadband Programme for schools has been increased from 6 to 14 and this has led to a greater availability of improved services being made available for schools, most of the new providers are small wireless operators.  Over 95% of primary schools availing of a service from school's broadband programme: 64% DSL; 32% Wireless; 2% Satellite; and 2% Cable.  There have also been a small number of primary schools connected by UPC with 100Mbit/s connections.</p><p>  Of the wireless schools 67% would be on connections of 8Mbit/s or higher, with the remaining schools on connections of between 2Mbit/s and 6Mbit/s.  Those schools on DSL are on connections of up to 24Mbit/s.  However, depending on the quality of the copper and the distance of the school from the local exchange the speed a school receives can be as low as 2Mbit/s.  Approximately 111 schools are receiving connection of 2Mbit/s or less.  There are also 74 schools still on satellite connections.  Due to ongoing tendering competitions the number of schools on these very slow connections are continually being reduced.</p><p>  This Department has also entered into discussions with DSL providers in order to ensure that schools can avail of the roll out of fibre on Eircom's wholesale network.  This should also lead to greatly improved speeds being made available to schools.</p></reply>

Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.</p><p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41.  There are no plans at this point to further increase the number of appeals officers in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p><p>  A new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office and a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have achieved significant improvements.  The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400. The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued in 2013 with the processing time reducing to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  Processing time has continued to improve in 2014. As at 30 April 2014, the time take to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing had reduced to 29.7 weeks and 22.6 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to be made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 13,042 at 26 May 2014.</p></reply>

I am also advised that it appears that the intention of the proposed Bye-laws is to protect and preserve the wild trout population in the river sections identified by the Clubs.  I have very recently received, from IFI, a draft national policy on brown trout which is being reviewed in the Department.  The requests from the three Clubs would appear to be consistent with the conservation ethos which the draft policy seeks to underpin and consideration will be given to accommodating the Clubs' proposals in line with the recommendations of the draft policy.  Proposed Bye-laws are informed by available appropriate scientific advice regarding size and bag limits for the relevant waters on the basis of stock assessment and spawning characteristics.</p><p>  IFI also advise that, arising from the draft national trout policy review and any revision to national regulations which results, that the introduction of an comprehensive Bye-law for trout for the Upper Erne might be preferable to putting in place a range of disparate Bye-laws for the numerous waters in the area.  Any proposed Bye-laws will also be subject to the required appropriate period of public consultation that will allow all relevant stakeholders to make input to the proposals.  In addition, issues such as access to and ownership of fisheries will also need to be clarified and addressed.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  The Government has decided, following consideration of proposals in relation to the funding model for Irish Water to provide a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply.  The Government has also decided to provide for an additional free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as child benefit, such that water charges will in effect only apply to adults in such households.  Based on estimated normal consumption, the allowance being provided will be up to 38,000 litres per annum.  This level of consumption will be verified over time through actual data from metering. </p><p>  The Government has also decided that bills will be capped at the relevant assessed charge level for those customers with particular medical conditions which necessitate high water usage.  Qualifying medical conditions will be set out, following consultation with the Minister for Health and the Health Services Executive.</p></reply>

My Department funds a network of twenty one volunteer centres.  It also provides funding to Volunteer Ireland, the national volunteer development agency.  The focus of Volunteer Ireland is to create an enabling environment for volunteering, to develop an ethos of volunteerism across all sectors of society and to be an independent and legitimate voice for volunteering.  The volunteer centres act as 'brokers' between potential volunteers and organisations seeking volunteers.  They also work with organisations to develop their volunteer management capacity and facilitate Garda vetting for smaller organisations.   </p><p>  My Department is currently undertaking a review of the existing policy on volunteer centres.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-05-29a.232.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014052900052#WRD03800"><p>Following the agreement reached on the Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Single Payment Scheme will be replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme.  In addition to the Basic Payment Scheme, Member States must introduce a 'Payment for Agricultural Practices beneficial for the Climate and the Environment' or greening, as it is more commonly known.  Farmers who participate in the Basic Payment Scheme must implement the three standard greening measures as follows: <blockquote>-   Protection of permanent grassland<br /><br />-   Crop diversification<br /><br />-   Ecological Focus Area (EFA).</blockquote>In general, the greening provisions apply mainly to arable farmers excluding small-scale arable growers.  There are, however, a number of exemptions whereby arable farmers will be exempt from greening of which the following are the most significant for Irish farmers:</p><p>-Where more than 75% of the eligible land of the holding is permanent grassland, provided the arable area not covered by these uses does not exceed 30 hectares.</p><p>-Land that is subject to organic farming practices automatically fulfils all greening requirements. </p><p>Permanent grassland is defined as land that has not been included in the crop-rotation of a holding for five years or more.</p><p>In Ireland, I decide that the obligation to maintain permanent grassland would be applied at national level rather than at individual or regional level.  Under the provisions of the Regulations, Member States, who apply the provisions at national level &ndash; like Ireland - must ensure that the ratio of permanent grassland to total agricultural area shall be maintained and that this ratio shall not decrease by more than 5% compared with the 2012 ratio of permanent grassland to total agricultural area.  Based on the current situation, this is unlikely to decrease by more than 5% in the foreseeable future.  Therefore there is no obligation imposed on individual farmers to meet this requirement at this stage.  </p><p>There is no crop diversification requirement where a farmer holds less than ten hectares of arable land.  Where a farmer holds between ten and thirty hectares of arable land, he is obliged to grow at least two crops.  Where a farmer holds more than thirty hectares of arable land, he is obliged to grow at least three crops.  Winter and Spring Barley, for example, are considered two separate crops and temporary grassland is also classed as a separate crop group for the purpose of crop diversification.  For the majority of farmers who are involved in crop rotation, the crop diversification requirement will have very little impact.  </p><p>Farmers whose holdings include less than 15ha of arable land are exempt from this measure.  Where a holding includes more than 15 hectares of arable land, at least 5% of that arable land is allocated to Ecological Focus Area.  Land that is considered as Ecological Focus Area may include hedges, drains, buffer strips, fallow land, areas with catch crops or green cover and nitrogen fixing crops.  Protein crops used for EFA purposes may also qualify for an additional payment under a Scheme of Coupled Support for Protein Crops.  For the majority of farmers the 5% EFA requirement will be met with existing arrangements and no further action will be required.     </p><p>Officials from my Department are engaging with farming organisations, the arable sector and the industry in general so as to ensure that measures as implemented in Ireland will take into account issues facing arable farmers.</p></reply>

The position is that in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA Report into the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway, and the Report on the establishment of Hospital Groups, the West/North West Hospital Group undertook a review of maternity services within the Group.  The review included the maternity units at Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe, Mayo General Hospital, University Hospital Galway, Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  While the review presents various options for service reconfiguration, I understand that the review does not recommend any particular option, nor indeed the closure of any maternity unit.  </p><p>My Department is currently developing a new National Strategy for Maternity Services which will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  As part of the development of the Strategy, <i>all</i>maternity services in the country will be reviewed and evaluated.  Any decision on maternity service reconfiguration will be considered in the context of the National Strategy, and therefore on a national rather than on a local basis.
