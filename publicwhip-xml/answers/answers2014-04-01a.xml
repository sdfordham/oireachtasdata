Work on reconfiguration of clinical services across these hospitals has been ongoing for some time, to bring service provision in line with best practice.  As part of the reorganisation of services in this region, in November 2013, the emergency service at St Columcille's transferred to St Vincent's.  In addition, St Columcille's opened a Local Injury Unit, open from 8am to 6pm, 7 days per week, and a consultant led Medical Assessment Unit, also open from 8am to 6pm, 7 days per week.  Separating out the Local Injury Unit from the Emergency Department  means that patient flow is improved within and between these hospitals. </p><p>  Following this reconfiguration of services a redistribution of workload from the Emergency Department in St Columcille's was expected and planned for.   During the planning phase it was acknowledged that there would be a three to six month phase while the new patient care pathways bedded down, and local patients and General Practitioners became familiar with the new arrangements.  The patient flow between the hospitals is being monitored on an ongoing basis and has been reviewed and amended as required in the light of experience.  I am advised by the HSE that St Vincent's Hospital Emergency Department is being appropriately managed, and is clinically safe.  Staffing levels are kept under review to ensure that the staffing is appropriate to the volume of patients attending the Emergency Department.  An analysis of the activity in St Vincent's Emergency Department for the period post reconfiguration shows that patient experience times remain favourable by comparison with other hospitals.  There fewer people on trolleys and patient experience times continue to be among the best in Dublin.</p><p>  I must emphasis that the rationale and policy context for implementing the change to emergency services is to provide a safer environment for patients and to ensure that patients receive the appropriate treatment in the appropriate setting.  I would like to commend management and clinicians in the region who are committed to these changes in the interest of best possible patient care.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-01a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040100053#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 113 together.</p><p>  Like many other countries in Europe, Ireland's population is ageing rapidly.  At the last Census in 2011, there were approximately 535,000 people aged over 65 in the population, representing an increase of 14.4% since 2006.  By 2041 there will be an estimated 1.3 million to 1.4 million people aged over 65 years, representing 20-25% of the total population.  The greatest increases are expected in the over-80 years age group, where numbers are expected to increase four-fold from 110,000 in 2006 to about 440,000 in 2041.</p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS).  The Strategy was published and launched in April 2013 outlining Ireland's vision for ageing and older people.  The Strategy contains a large number of action areas around older people's participation in society, health and social care provision, financial and physical security, and the need for an evidence-based approach to policy making.  Preparations are now in train for the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy and the arrangements for this implementation will be finalised as soon as possible.  The needs of our older people are, and will remain, a very high priority for me and for the Government, and the resources that are available will always be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services. </p><p>  Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private nursing home facilities.  Most of the residents receive significant financial support towards the cost of their care under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  While there will always be a need for long-term residential care, older people have consistently said that they want to be facilitated and supported to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Accordingly the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently being undertaken will consider how residential and other supports and services should be balanced in the future to  support older people in ways that best meet their wishes and that make the best possible use of available resources.  As a first step, in 2014 an additional &euro;23m is being provided to strengthen community and home-based services and to develop more flexible and responsive approaches to care.  This is in addition to the budget of &euro;315m already provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time.</p><p>  With the above said, the Government is acutely aware of the implications for service requirements of the projected demographic trends, and all relevant information will be taken account of in future decisions.  A key priority identified in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014 is the implementation of a Single Assessment Tool (SAT) for older people.  This standardised framework will uniformly assess dependency levels, allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible.  The first phase of implementation of the SAT will commence in 2014 with a minimum of 50% of all new entries to the NHSS, Home Care Package and Home Help Schemes assessed by the SAT in the last quarter of 2014, with full implementation of SAT by the end of 2015.</p></reply>

The Development Board is currently in the final selection phase of the process leading to the appointment of the Design Team.  Short-listed architectural teams have been announced, and tender documents issued on 24 March to these and all shortlisted bidders across all design team disciplines.  </p><p>  The full design team is expected to be appointed in June and, following hospital design development, planning submission is expected in February 2015.  A planning decision is expected in August 2015 and construction is scheduled to commence also in August 2015.  Transition of services to the new children's hospital is expected to commence at the end of 2018.  I also announced in January that satellite centres of the main hospital would be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  Each will provide urgent care and outpatient care, improving access for children in the Greater Dublin Area to these services and are expected to be complete in mid-2016. </p><p>  The Children's Hospital Group is focused on ensuring the operational integration of the three existing children's hospital services well in advance of their move to the new hospital.  This is of critical importance in ensuring the new hospital functions effectively from the outset.</p></reply>

The diagnosis, treatment and care of individuals with spina bifida and hydrocephalus requires input from all of these services and the qualified specialist people working in these areas. </p><p>  The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.  I understand all infants born in Ireland with spina bifida are referred to Temple Street after birth for ongoing neonatal management.  Children with spina bifida are seen by a multidisciplinary team at Temple Street including a Spina Bifida Nurse Specialist.  <font color="#0000FF"> </font></p><p>  The HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability, including persons with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, to achieve his or her full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers.  Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers and community groups.  </p><p>  The HSE provides funding to Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland amounting to &euro;798,031 in 2013.  In addition, the HSE also provided funding of &euro;128,152 in 2013 to the Mid West Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association.</p><p>  Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland has branches in all four provinces.  It operates a professionally run National Resource Centre based in Clondalkin, Dublin, and provides further support in the form of a Family Support Team, a Youth and Respite Team and an advocacy and advice service providing guidance, advocacy, emotional and practical support to members from time of diagnosis through to adulthood.  I would like to acknowledge the work of Spina Bifida Hydrocephalus Ireland and the significant role it has played in the lives of people with spina bifida and hydrocephalus.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-01a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040100053#WRA01600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in May of last year, I published the Report on the Establishment of Hospital Groups<i>. </i> The formation of acute hospitals into a small number of groups will provide the optimum configuration for hospital services to deliver high quality, safe patient care.   Each group will have at least one major university teaching hospital, a cancer centre and a maternity service, and is required to develop a strategic plan within one year of establishment.  These plans will describe how the Group will: (i) provide more efficient and effective patient services, including for maternity care; (ii) reorganise these services to provide optimal care to the populations they serve; and (iii) achieve maximum integration and synergy with other groups and all other health services. </p><p>  In terms of the reorganisation of maternity services, the recently published Chief Medical Officer's report on Portlaoise Hospital Maternity Services is also of relevance.  That Report recommended that the Portlaoise Maternity Service should become part of a managed clinical network under a singular governance model with the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infant University Hospital.  The Report also recommended that other small maternity services around the country should be incorporated into managed clinical networks within the relevant hospital group.  I have accepted all of the Report's recommendations.  The rollout of such managed clinical networks work will be undertaken in the context of the implementation of Hospital Groups.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is preparing a National Maternity Strategy which will provide the strategic direction for the optimal development of safe and high quality maternity services.  The Strategy will incorporate a review and evaluation of our services and therefore provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how the quality and safety of care provided to women and their babies can be further improved.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-01a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040100053#WRA02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 124 and 134 together.</p><p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has not raised concerns with the Department of Health or the HSE about sections of the draft agreement for the provision of services to children under six years that relate to the exchange of information between General Practitioners (GPs) and the HSE.  However, it is the HSE's intention to consult with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the contract, when finalised, is fully compliant with the requirements of data protection legislation.</p><p>  The Department and the HSE have been working collaboratively for a number of years with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), under the auspices of the General Practitioner Information Technology (GPIT) Group, to further enhance the already impressive level of ICT deployment in general practice.  Examples of the initiatives that are being progressed in general practice include specialist electronic referrals, general electronic referrals, secure e-mail, the management of client indices and electronic diagnostic messaging.  Other potential areas where ICT deployment would be of benefit include electronic prescribing, clinician decision support functionality, electronic registers to support the management of chronic diseases, and shared electronic records to support the integrated care of patients within the primary care setting and between primary and secondary care clinicians.</p><p>  It is envisaged that the draft contract for children under 6 years, when finalised, will facilitate the continued deployment of technology based solutions in general practice.  In this context, it is hoped that the GPIT group will continue to fulfil its key collaborative role in facilitating the introduction of ICT initiatives through the consensus based approach that has worked well over the past number of years.  In a similar vein, it is intended that the contract, in its final format, will support and encourage GPs to observe cost effective prescribing through, inter alia, decision support technology, as well as evidence based support and guidance from the HSE Medicines Management Programme.  The provisions on prescribing practice in the draft contract are not intended to impose unwarranted interference on a GP's clinical judgement and autonomy.  The details around how prescribing initiatives will be implemented will involve extensive and focused engagement with GPs who are, I believe committed to the efficient use of  resources to ensure that we achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.</p><p>  The concept of performance reviews is a well-recognised feature of contracts for service and for this reason has been included in this draft contract.  I have noted the comments received on this matter as part of the public consultation process and I am open to accommodating the views of the key stakeholders in the final contract. </p><p>  Regarding the publication of a revised draft contract, I am keen to ensure that the draft contract is subjected to a rigorous consultative process and I am quite prepared to amend the document, as appropriate, based on the feedback and commentary received.  In this context, I have written to the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to assure them that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  I have also explained that there will be an opportunity for their input on the fee structure, which will be addressed by means of a related consultation process.</p><p>  I trust that the IMO will accept my invitation to commence negotiations with the Department and the HSE.  I am confident that a process of open discussion has the potential to significantly enhance the draft contract for patients, GPs, the HSE and the Department, thus helping to progress our common goal of free GP care at the point of access.</p></reply>

A significant part of the report refers to services provided by the Child and Family Agency, and my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has recently responded to the issues raised in the report.  As a number of the report's recommendations relate to the HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, and the need for improved inter-agency co-operation with the Child and Family Agency, I have asked the Executive to consider these and determined the steps necessary to address the issues identified.  </p><p>  The HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services are benefitting significantly from the funding provided by the Government for mental health services, which amounts to &euro;766 million in 2014, including additional funding of &euro;20 million this year, as part of total additional funding of &euro;90 million over the period 2012 to 2014 inclusive.  By the end of 2014, upwards of 1,100 new posts will be put in place, to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for both adults and children, and develop other specialist mental health services. </p><p><i>  A Vision for Change</i>  recommended the establishment of 99 multi-disciplinary Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams to provide acute secondary mental health care in the community.  There are now 61 CAMHS teams in place, compared to 54 in 2008.  The additional funding in 2012-14 is being used, in part to expand and enhance the skill mix of these teams.  Around 230 new posts were allocated to CAMHS over 2012-13 and recruitment is well advanced.  The increasing demands being placed on our Child Mental Health Services were reflected in the 14,000 or so referrals received by CAMHS teams in 2013.  This was nearly 1,000 or 8% more, than projected in the HSE National Service Plan last year.  However, the target of 70% of referrals being seen within 3 months was maintained. </p><p>  I accept that there are specific additional risks of developing mental illness associated with children who are within the care system and that a proportion of the children attending CAMHS services are in contact with, or in the care of, the social services.  A comprehensive protocol is in place between the HSE and the Child and Family Agency to ensure that the needs of children in the care of the State have access to CAMHS services in the same way as any other child with a mental illness, prioritised on need.</p></reply>

Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in Ireland, affecting people of all ages and all socio-economic groups.  Ireland has the fourth highest prevalence of asthma worldwide and current estimates suggest that there are approximately 450,000 people with doctor-diagnosed asthma in Ireland (approximately 1 in 10 of the population).  The prevalence is even higher in children, with about 21% of children affected.  Asthma is often under-diagnosed and uncontrolled, creating a substantial burden of ill-health to individuals.  Between 35% and 50% of medical expenditure on asthma is a consequence of exacerbations, an asthma outcome most view as representing treatment failure.  Hospitalisation, emergency department and unscheduled hospital visits, and use of rescue medications comprise the majority of exacerbation-related treatment costs.</p><p>  The overarching aim of the NCPA is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner  out-of-hours services, emergency departments and in-patient services.  The development of the Programme has been influenced by international evidence of the effectiveness of asthma management, with significantly improved outcomes focusing on improving asthma control in the community.  The initial focus of the work of the NCPA has been on the development of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice, early asthma diagnosis, active asthma treatment, guided self-management and patient education.</p><p>  The Programme has also developed a National Model of Care for Asthma, which details how physicians, nurses and other health professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  A number of elements of the NCPA have already been implemented, including development of guidelines, an asthma education programme and patient education materials.  The NCPA is listed in the HSE's Primary Care Divisional Operational Plan for 2014 and work is underway on an implementation plan for the Model of Care.  The work of the Programme will ensure that patients with asthma will benefit from being part of a well-managed integrated system of care, coordinated at primary care level.</p></reply>

The main focus of the scheme is to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions through improved heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and a staff awareness campaign to reduce energy consumption where possible.  In the last two years, the main heating system was upgraded as was the Building Management System which provided more efficient generation and distribution of the heating.  As a result, savings have been achieved in the heating and electricity consumption at my Department's offices in Hawkins House, notwithstanding the age of the building and the limitations arising from single glazed metal windows.  The overall energy consumption has been reduced by 9% since the Scheme was introduced in 2007.  </p><p>  In regard to the Health Service Executive (HSE) I have been informed that in early 2013 the National Health Sustainability Office (NHSO) was established within the Estates Function of the HSE.  All Sustainability related, including all energy, waste and water related projects, will now be channelled through the NHSO.  The following strategies, which will include clearly identified targets and objectives, are currently being developed by the office:<blockquote>- Health Energy Strategy: Currently being finalised<br /><br />- National strategies for  Clinical and Hazardous Waste, Domestic Waste, Water and Wastewater: To be developed in 2014<br /><br />- National Health Sustainability Strategy: To be developed in 2014.</blockquote>  Since the NHSO's establishment a number of steps have been undertaken by the office to encourage and promote energy savings in premises.  These include:<blockquote>- Energy MAP Training: National training programme on energy management and capacity building run in conjunction with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  The attendance over the three-day programme equated to approximately 400 person days and included representation from the Voluntary Hospitals<br /><br />- Geographical Survey: A survey involving 2,443 sites was carried out in 2013 to obtain key information necessary for national sustainability programmes- Statutory Obligation of S.I. 542:  The geographic survey included the recording of MPRN electricity meters and GPRN gas meters numbers at each site which were reported and verified on the SEAI  database.  The HSE is now fully compliant with this Statutory obligation<br /><br />- Energy Service Company (ESCo) Proposals: Phase 1 Exemplar Projects - The HSE is at the pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) stage with three ESCo proposals - installation of wood fuelled boilers to Roscommon General Hospital, Sacred Heart Hospital and Aras Attracta in Swinford, including a deep retrofit of Aras Attracta<br /><br />- Office of Public Works (OPW) energy management programme: The HSE has piloted three sites; Oak House, Dr Steevens Hospital and Sir Patrick Duns.  Tallaght Hospital and Galway University Hospital are also under consideration<br /><br />- District Heating Proposal: There are two systems under review, Letterkenny and Kerry General Hospitals<br /><br />- Energy Efficient Design Reviews: One project is now complete under this process and using the lessons learnt five more projects are in the programme.</blockquote>  The success of such strategies will be gauged in a number of ways including:<blockquote>- Statutory and Regulatory compliance: Inform, monitor and audit with regard to the various Statutory and Regulatory compliance requirements<br /><br />- ESCo Utilisation: Deliver the strategic programme of energy reduction through ESCo utilisation; with phase one being the Exemplar Projects programme and Phase 2 the introduction of the <b><i>Sustainability Concession Programme</i></b><br /><br />- Continuos Measurement Tool: Develop a continuos measurement tool for HSE implementation of sustainability measures in relation to: procurement, travel, facilities management, workforce, community engagement and buildings<br /><br />- Contract Management: Manage energy, water and waste contracts corporately through a standard methodology and approach and introduce relevant energy, water and waste management related software and systems to ensure a standard and efficient approach<br /><br />- Sustainability Management Concession Contract and the Corporate Sustainability Management Services: These key programmes of work, which have been identified as the main vehicles for developing and implementing the National Health Sustainability Strategy, will be progressed in 2014 and include the development of a fully integrated Sustainability Reporting System and Centralised Payment System (SRCPS) in anticipation of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament being transposed by June 2014 with mandatory compliance by December 2015.</blockquote></p></reply>

The process which has been ongoing with the Section 38 Agencies to reach compliance with government pay policy is nearing completion.  Since the beginning of the year the Regional Directors of Performance and Integration (RDPI's), with support from Regional HR, have been working with each Agency to verify where there are deviations from pay policy and to assist the Agencies to become compliant with health sector pay policy.</p><p>  In line with the pay policy, organisations which wished to continue payment of an unapproved allowance were invited to submit their business cases for consideration by the HSE.  Business cases were also required for the continued payment of allowances which are not encompassed by or in line with the Department of Health Consolidated Salary Scales but may have been sanctioned in the past.  A total of 202 business cases have now been received.  Where the HSE is satisfied that there are legitimate reasons for the continuation of an allowance, these will be submitted to the Department of Health for sanction.  The Department of Health will liaise as appropriate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  An Internal Review Panel, made up of  members of the HSE Leadership Team, have reviewed each business case in detail and a report on their deliberations is expected shortly.  143 business cases were received in respect of Senior Managers, i.e. those at a salary level of Grade VIII and above, for consideration by the Internal Review Panel.  In addition, 59 business cases in respect of employees on a salary level below Grade VIII have been reviewed by the Regional Directors of Performance and Integration with support from Regional HR.  As indicated above the Internal Review Panel process in the HSE is nearing completion.  The Department expects to receive a report on the outcome of the Review Panel's conclusions shortly and will then consider any business cases that the Review Panel consider may be justified, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Due to the complexity of the issues involved, it is difficult to give a precise timescale as to when this issue will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  However, I am determined that the payment of unapproved allowances to senior executives will be eliminated in an expeditious manner.</p></reply>

The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport.  The ongoing development of pre-hospital emergency care involves a range of initiatives, including the development of a single national control and dispatch system for the State.  This new system, expected to be completed in 2015, will deploy all emergency ambulance resources in the State, including emergency ambulances, rapid response and intermediate care vehicles, first responders, aeromedical services and ambulances in Dublin. </p><p>  In the context of the development of the national control system, the Dublin City Manager and the HSE's Chief Operating Officer have commissioned a joint review of DFB ambulance services in Dublin City and County.  The review will consider all aspects of ambulance operations provided by DFB within the Dublin area, including the capacity and capability of ambulance services.  The review will inform consideration of the best model for provision of emergency medical services in the greater Dublin area.  It is part of the process of ensuring a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology, so that emergency pre-hospital care can continue to modernise and services can be delivered in an appropriate and timely manner, to the benefit of patients.</p><p>  There has been speculation about this review and I am aware of the concerns expressed by some about the future of the service.  I want to assure those concerned that I fully appreciate the service the Fire Brigade provides.  This review is not a negative reflection on that service.  It is being conducted in parallel with the HIQA review of the National Ambulance Service and the NAS capacity review.  The intention behind all of these reviews is to examine our pre-hospital emergency care services throughout the country, with a view to identifying the best way to enable them to meet the challenges of the future.  I look forward to the recommendations of all three reviews, which I am certain will enable us to ensure that we provide a service capable of delivering the best possible outcomes for the public.</p></reply>

Subject to approval by senior managers, arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of staff where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement.  In addition, the HSE continues to fill a significant number of development posts in line with service priorities identified by Government. </p><p>  The HSE is aware of the need to address orthodontic waiting times and commissioned an independent national review of orthodontic services to give guidance as to what changes will be desirable.  The review has now been completed. The key issue highlighted by the review, which has assessed services nationally, is that the Orthodontic Service should be fully integrated within the Primary Care Service.  This is under consideration by the HSE to be implemented as part of the HSE's Transformation Programme.  Pilot schemes, which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists, are currently being introduced.  It is expected that these changes will have a positive impact on waiting times.</p><p>  The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.  It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Information on waiting times is collated by the HSE by region and for the intervals as shown below only.  The most recent information relates to the last quarter of 2013.<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment </th><th><div>1 - 6 months</div></th><th><div>7 - 12 months </div></th><th><div>13 - 24 months</div></th><th><div>2 - 3 years</div></th><th><div>Over 4 years</div></th><th><div>TOTAL</div></th></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster </td><td><div>823</div></td><td><div>723</div></td><td><div>1,056</div></td><td><div>973</div></td><td><div>178</div></td><td><div>3,753</div></td></tr><tr><td>HSE West </td><td><div>1,337</div></td><td><div>936</div></td><td><div>1,658</div></td><td><div>924</div></td><td><div>122</div></td><td><div>4,977</div></td></tr><tr><td>HSE South </td><td><div>620</div></td><td><div>516</div></td><td><div>829</div></td><td><div>1,056</div></td><td><div>373</div></td><td><div>3,394</div></td></tr><tr><td>HSE Dublin North East</td><td><div>440</div></td><td><div>783</div></td><td><div>855</div></td><td><div>842</div></td><td><div>496</div></td><td><div>3,416</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will have a choice of health insurer and access to a standard package of health services.  In addition, a system of financial protection will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising UHI premiums for those who qualify. </p><p>  The <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i>, currently at an advanced stage of drafting, will provide more detail on the UHI model for Ireland, the process for determining the future health basket, including the standard package of services covered under UHI, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to UHI.  Following an initial discussion on the White Paper in early March, the issue will return to Government in the near future with a view to publication thereafter.  This will be followed by consultation on the general approach set out in the White Paper and a separate consultation on the future health basket.</p><p>  My intention is to have all the necessary groundwork in place in early 2016 to enable us to phase in implementation of UHI between 2016 and 2019.</p></reply>

In addition to giving employment opportunities, a major objective of the Nurse Graduate scheme is to put in place more cost-effective service delivery arrangements, having regard to the high rates of expenditure on agency staffing and overtime.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agreed to the initiative on the basis that it would be outside the Employment Control Framework and deliver significant savings. </p><p>  Under the Haddington Road Agreement it was agreed that participants will be paid 85% of the first point of the new entrant scale in the first year and 90% in the second.  Alongside these valuable employment opportunities, those who take up offers will also be able to avail of supported further professional development.  The scheme will support the retention of graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enable them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  Participants will have access to a variety of care settings while gaining clinical experience.</p><p>  The educational component of the graduate nurse and midwife programme comprises a 2 year part-time 3 module Certificate Graduate Education Programme that will be Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland approved and academically accredited.  This formally accredited programme will have currency for accreditation for prior learning by Higher Education Institutes when graduates wish to undertake further study and progress towards a Masters Level Award at a later stage in their careers.</p><p>  Under the Programme, by the end of January 2014 the recruitment of over 600 graduate nurses was completed or in train, over 1,000 applications having been received.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to assess the feasibility of using HIPE data to derive healthcare quality indicators that could in the future be used to measure the quality of care provided by our hospitals.  The analysis undertaken used HIPE data from 2006 to 2010.  The analysis highlighted variations in findings with a small number of hospitals being identified as outliers for certain quality indicators.  There are many possible reasons for these variations including quality of data, for example coding issues and quality of care issues. </p><p>  This information was communicated to the hospitals through the Quality and Patient Safety Directorate of the HSE in order for the hospitals to determine the reasons for the variation.  My Department has been assured by the HSE that the hospitals have had the opportunity both to correct their data and address any quality of care issues.  As already stated the primary focus of this report was to look at the feasibility of these indicators and to progress to robust indicators for the future rather than carrying out a review of historical data.  Measuring the quality of healthcare in Ireland and publicly reporting how our services are performing is part of my Government's commitment to improved accountability and continued improvement in our health services.  Therefore it is the intention of my Department to develop a National Healthcare Quality Reporting System which will regularly publicly report quality indicators.   The first report on quality healthcare indicators derived from HIPE for the years 2011- 2013, at national, regional and identified hospital level will be published later this year.</p></reply>

A significant reform programme is currently underway which will provide a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology.  In that regard, additional funding of &euro;3.6 million and 43 staff have been provided in the National Service Plan 2014.  </p><p>  For ECHO calls, which are life threatening cardiac or respiratory calls, the HSE set a target in 2013 for 70% of vehicles to meet this response time.  For DELTA calls, for life-threatening conditions other than cardiac or respiratory, the target was 68%.  Nationally in 2013, emergency ambulances responded within 19 minutes for 69.4% of ECHO calls and 63.7% of DELTA calls.  Some individual regions performed as high as 79% for ECHO calls.  I would also point out that over 2,100 more emergency calls were reached within 19 minutes in 2013 than in 2012.  </p><p>  In order to drive improvement in response times, the 2014 National Service Plan sets a target that 80% of life threatening calls should be responded to in less than 19 minutes.  Ongoing performance improvement projects include:<blockquote>- the single national control system, to be completed in 2015  <br /><br />- the Intermediate Care Service, for routine and non-emergency transfers, allowing emergency vehicles to focus on emergency situations<br /><br />- the move to on-duty rostering and the development of a national rostering system<br /><br />- the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service - 368 missions were completed in 2013, one third of which involved time critical transfers of STEMI heart attack patients to primary PCI units. </blockquote>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to three separate reviews of ambulance services currently underway.  HIQA is examining the governance arrangements for pre-hospital emergency services; the HSE and Dublin City Council have commissioned a joint review of Dublin ambulance services to determine the optimal and most cost-effective model of ambulance services delivery for the city; and the UK Association of Ambulance Chief Executives is undertaking a comprehensive capacity review of the NAS, to determine what level of resourcing, in terms of staff, vehicles, skills and distribution, is required to deliver a safe and effective service now and into the future.  I am confident that these reviews will inform the development of a modern, clinically driven system, properly resourced, for appropriate and timely services to the benefit of patients.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-01a.99.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040100054#WRB01000"><p>The Government has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce the prices of drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE.  This has resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of originator drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including, significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states and these are the maximum prices paid by the HSE for originator drugs supplied through the community drug schemes.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A  new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 01 November 2012, the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products is 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in agreement on additional price reductions and, from 1 May 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% currently to approximately 20%.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act.  The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply.  In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.  It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines.  It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices. </p><p>  In the case of  drugs and medicines which are paid for by the HSE, prices are set in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 or the terms of the framework agreements between the Department of Health and the HSE and the representative bodies for pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland.  However, neither the Minister for Health nor the HSE has any power to set the prices of drugs and medicines purchased by private patients.  However, I would be disappointed if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices to patients.  The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned. </p><p>  Finally, my Department has asked the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (the pharmacy regulator) to consider how to provide greater price transparency in retail pharmacies.  This examination is ongoing.</p></reply>

The Statistics Act, 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Statistics Acts, and provided for the release of census forms from these censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant Census.</p><p>  When the 100 years access was debated in the Seanad the view was expressed that this time period should be reduced to 75, or even 50 years.  However, while the retrospective introduction of the 100 years exemption was seen by some as undermining the original guarantee given to householders, it was generally accepted that 100 years was a reasonable compromise given that relatively few people would still be alive after 100 years.  I am satisfied that the timeframe provided for in the Statistics Act strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate historical and genealogical research on the one hand, while protecting the confidentiality of census data and maintaining the integrity of CSO guarantees procedures.</p></reply>

This has been achieved in the face of record levels of demand in 2012 and with continuing reductions in full-time staff.  The achievement of savings in overtime costs has resulted from a number of factors, including the streamlining of existing arrangements for processing of applications at the public counters and the introduction of a scheduled appointment service.  The old system for processing applications at public counters was a particularly time-consuming and staff-intensive feature of the service. </p><p>  Other changes have been introduced with regard to acceptance of applications by ordinary post which had a high rejection rate and consequently more processing time and cost.  This change has resulted in greater use of the Passport Express service provided by An Post and this has also contributed to efficiencies.

The Taoiseach, who attended the European Council, has already reported to this House on those discussions and on the decisions of the Heads of State and Government.  The European Council adopted a strong message of support to Ukraine and agreed on a number of concrete measures in that regard.  It called for rapid agreement on macro-financial assistance to Ukraine and underlined that an agreement with the IMF is critical to enable this assistance.  I am pleased to say that the IMF has since announced a standby assistance package worth between $14 and $18 billion.  EU Member States have agreed to coordinate their positions in the IMF regarding the conditions for assistance to Ukraine. </p><p>  As a sign of the Union's support for, and solidarity with the people and government of Ukraine, the EU leaders also signed the political provisions of the Association Agreement with Ukraine.  The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatseniuk, signed on behalf of his country.  In its Conclusions, the European Council commended the measured response shown so far by Ukraine and welcomed the government's commitment to ensure the representative nature and inclusiveness of governmental structures, reflecting regional diversity, to ensure the full protection of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, to undertake constitutional reform, to investigate all human rights violations and acts of violence and to fight extremism.  In this context, the EU encouraged the government of Ukraine to ensure that the Presidential election on 25 May will be free and fair.</p><p>  The European Council strongly condemned the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol to the Russian Federation and made clear that the Union would not recognise it.  The European Council was clear that there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century.  The Russian actions are in clear breach of the Helsinki process, which in the past 40 years has contributed to overcoming divisions in Europe and building a peaceful and united continent.  In view of the absence of any steps towards de-escalation, the Heads of State and Government decided on an extension of the visa ban and asset freeze and cancelled the next EU-Russia summit which had been scheduled to take place in Sochi in June. </p><p>  While remaining open for dialogue, the European Council recalled in its Conclusions that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other hand.  In this respect, the European Council asked the Commission and the Member States to prepare possible targeted measures.  In the meantime, the European Council has asked the Commission to evaluate the legal consequences of the annexation of Crimea and to propose economic, trade and financial restrictions regarding Crimea for rapid implementation.</p><p>  The question of the nature and scope of sanctions is always a complex and difficult issue and, as the Taoiseach said in Brussels, inevitably will have negative economic consequences for the EU, including Ireland, as well as for Russia.  It is only right, therefore, that we prepare such decisions carefully and we have tasked the Commission accordingly.  Ireland is engaged in the continuing discussions with our partners in Brussels on this matter.</p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding those Russian citizens against whom sanctions have been applied by the European Union, it would not be appropriate to comment on any individuals.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that Ireland is complying with its obligations.  While the EU Regulations concerned have direct effect in Ireland, it is necessary to introduce secondary legislation provisions to create the necessary offences and penalties which are to apply and these are currently being drafted.</p></reply>

Following the Weston Park Agreement, the British government set up an administrative scheme to deal with OTRs.  While the Government was not directly involved in the establishment of this scheme, nor was a similar scheme established in this jurisdiction, we would see the administrative scheme for OTRs established by the British government as a natural progression from the agreement made at Weston Park.</p><p>  On 27 February Prime Minister Cameron announced that he would appoint a judge to provide an independent review of the OTRs scheme in light of the errors identified in the John Downey case.  The terms of reference of the review are:<blockquote>- to produce a full public account of the operation and extent of the administrative scheme for OTRs<br /><br />- to determine whether any letters sent through the scheme contained errors<br /><br />- to make recommendations as necessary on this or related matters that are drawn to the attention of the inquiry</blockquote>  On 11 March, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers announced further details relating to the scheme.  The review will be chaired by Lady Justice Hallett, with a view to completing the review by the end of May 2014, and no later than the end of June.  It is intended that the review itself will be published.  Lady Justice Hallett has made clear that she will be both independent and impartial in carrying out her task.  This is, of course, an independent judge-led review.  </p><p>   I continue to maintain regular and ongoing contact with not only the First Minister and deputy First Minister but with the other Party Leaders in the context of the ongoing political talks.  I will continue to emphasise the need for a successful conclusion to these talks, and the need to deal with the legacy of the past in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.</p></reply>

The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.   </p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.  As I was aware of the potential impact on lower income households, I chose not to introduce the carbon tax on solid fuels until after the 2012/2103 winter period and I opted to introduce the tax in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 from 1st May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO2.   </p><p>  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  Accordingly I do not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May 2014.</p></reply>

Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.   </p><p>  Where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority, and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property.  Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property that has been adapted unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.   </p><p>  I understand that my officials, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, are currently looking at issues related to the operation of the LPT reliefs available for certain disabled and/or incapacitated individuals.</p></reply>

Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended) sets out the disclosure of information obligations of those employed or engaged by the Central Bank.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it is the general practice to require third party suppliers/contractors  to sign a Section 33AK declaration, whereby the contractor or supplier acknowledges that it has been made aware of the secrecy provisions of the Central Bank Acts and agrees to notify each of its employees engaged in providing services or supplies to the Central Bank of such obligations, and, where appropriate, have that employee sign a separate Section 33AK declaration in his or her own name.  This ensures that all persons (both the company and individual employees of that company), are subject to both statutory and contractual obligations in respect of confidential information and compliance with Section 33AK.   </p><p>  Furthermore, I have been informed by the Central Bank that it is a registered organisation with the Garda Vetting Unit, and this unit, with the approval of the subject of enquiry, makes criminal history disclosures of such enquiries to the Central Bank.  The policy of the Central Bank is to conduct Garda vetting for all employees and also for any third party service providers or contractors who qualify for unaccompanied access to Central Bank premises.  The policies of the Central Bank with regard to employees and third party service providers are to ensure that appropriate controls and legal conditions are in place to prevent unauthorised disclosure of Central Bank data.   </p><p>   In the case of the service provider named by the Deputy, it is a specific condition of the contract that Garda vetting checks may be undertaken if directed by the Central Bank.  In addition, the service provider is under an express contractual obligation to the Central Bank to ensure those working on Central Bank services are made aware of their professional secrecy obligations arising under Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended), including their duties with respect to maintaining confidential information of the Central Bank and the fact that contravention of Section 33AK (1) is a criminal offence.  (In this context it should also be noted that this service provider does not have access to any of the Central Bank's business applications.  The security of the technical aspects of the systems are achieved through a combination of physical and logical protections, procedural and process protections, security features including encryption where necessary and on-going monitoring and reporting features).   </p><p>  In relation to the outsourcing of IT services, the Central Bank selected Hewlett Packard as a result of an open tendering process in compliance with the strict guidelines laid down by the EU public procurement process.  I am informed by the Central Bank that a robust business case in which a number of alternatives were investigated thoroughly and compared across a number of criteria, including cost, was produced and was approved by the Central Bank Commission.  The costs agreed with the provider are commercially sensitive and are not available for release.  However the approach taken by the Central Bank was considerably advantageous on cost when compared to the alternatives examined.   </p><p>  The Central Bank has notified me that the migration of data centre services to Hewlett Packard will be fully completed in the coming weeks.  A phased migration approach was adopted as part of a fixed price contract and the first live services began in May 2013, with the majority of the services running from the Hewlett Packard premises since September/October 2013.  The migration timeframe included a number of months delay arising from a range of factors.  The residual service migration is currently under way and is scheduled to complete by end April 2014.</p></reply>

In Budget 2014, I announced an extension of the capital gains tax retirement relief which was subsequently implemented in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.  That Act amended section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which grants relief in respect of a disposal of business or agricultural assets which have been owned and used for business or farming purposes for a period of at least 10 years prior to the disposal of those assets.  The relief also applies to land which has been let in certain circumstances where the 10-year ownership and use test has been met immediately before the letting of the land commenced.   </p><p>  The amendment retained the existing relief where the land was let at any time in the period of 15 years prior to the disposal and the disposal is to a child (within the meaning of section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) of the individual disposing of the land.  In this connection, section 599 provides that a child includes a child of a deceased child, certain nephews and nieces and foster children in certain circumstances.  The amendment in Finance (No.2) Act 2013 provides that CGT retirement relief under section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies where the land has been leased under a formal agreement to a person for the purposes of farming and each letting of that land is for a minimum period of 5 consecutive years in the period of 15 years prior to the disposal and that disposal is to a person other than a child (within the meaning of section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) of the individual disposing of the land.   </p><p>  I am advised, therefore, that if the relevant land was rented for 5 years under an informal letting arrangement such as a conacre agreement and the disposal is to a person other than a child (within the meaning of section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997), retirement relief would not apply.</p></reply>

A standard approach used is to provide for a relief in primary law and set out the terms and conditions in secondary legislation.  It should be noted that the question is very wide reaching and the research needed to ensure that all of the tax benefits referred to in the question were identified could not be conducted in the time available.  There may, therefore, be examples of tax benefits or concessions in addition to those identified.  I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to tax benefits that impact on the level of tax liabilities or reliefs that may be availed by taxpayers.  If the Deputy has a specific tax benefit or issue in mind, he may wish to contact the Revenue Commissioners directly.   </p><p>  In general terms, such credits, reliefs, allowances and deductions are granted on the basis of a claimant meeting the qualifying criteria set out in primary legislation.  Any alteration of the qualifying criteria for these credits, reliefs, allowances and deductions can only be brought about by amending primary legislation.  In addition, allowances, reliefs and deductions are generally based on the amount paid or incurred by an individual or a percentage of the amount paid or incurred.  Any alteration to this can only be brought about by amending primary legislation.   </p><p><b>Income tax</b></p><p>  Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides for exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers, and artists.  Ministerial Guidelines on the relief are issued by the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.   </p><p>Relief for fees paid for third level education:  </p><p>  The definition of &quot;qualifying fees&quot; under section 473A TCA 1997, allows the Minister for Education and Science, with the consent of the Minister for Finance to set the maximum amount of fees allowable in respect of an approved course for an academic year.  This is currently set at &euro;7,000.   </p><p><b>Indirect Taxes </b></p><p>  The reliefs and exemptions in relation to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) are provided for in the 1992 Finance Act and in a number Ministerial Regulations.  A series of Regulations were made coinciding with and following the introduction of VRT in 1993.  These regulations provide more detailed conditions under which reliefs and exemptions may be granted, for example where repayments of VRT may be made (SI No. 437 of 1992), where tax may be remitted or repaid to disabled drivers, passengers or organisations (SI No. 353 of 1994), where relief may be granted for transferring domicile to the State (SI No. 59 of 1993), where tax may be exempted for temporary importation (SI No. 60 of 1993).   </p><p>  In  relation to VAT primary legislation provides that reliefs may be granted by way of Ministerial Order.  There are a small number of VAT Refund Orders in place that are generally historic and have been made for societal or economic purposes.  Examples of such reliefs in relation to VAT are as follows:<blockquote>Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 15) Order 1981 (S.I. No 428 of 1981) which provides for refund of VAT in relation to goods purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons.   <br /><br />Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 23) Order 1992 (S.I. No 58 of 1992) which provides for refunds of VAT in relation to qualifying medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations.   Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(Flat-rate Farmers) Order  2012 (S.I. No 201 of 2012) which provides for refunds of VAT paid by farmers in respect of construction of farm buildings, fencing, drainage and micro-generation equipment.   </blockquote><b>Exercise of discretion by Revenue - Pensions </b></p><p>  Part 30 of the TCA 1997 grants discretionary powers to Revenue in relation to the approval of occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and PRSAs.  The Revenue Pensions Manual, published on the Revenue website, gives general guidance on how these powers are exercised and describes certain administrative provisions arising on foot of the exercising of Revenue's discretion in the pensions area.  Amongst these provisions, and of particular relevance in the context of the question, is that relating to the payment of once-off pensions (i.e. full commutation) in respect of trivial or small pensions funds.   </p><p>  Under this measure, an approved pension scheme may permit full commutation of a pension if the aggregate benefits payable to an employee under the scheme and any other scheme relating to the same employment, do not exceed the value of a pension of &euro;330 per annum.  This treatment may also be offered in the same circumstances to holders of PRSAs and RACs.  The commuted pension is subject to tax at a rate of 10% as provided for under section 781(3) TCA 1997.  Alternatively, a once-off pension payment may be made where the total of all funds available for pension benefits from all sources, following payment of any lump sum benefit, is less than &euro;20,000.  In these circumstances, the rates of tax and USC to be applied are those that apply to any other pension payment.   </p><p><b>Revenue practices intended to facilitate compliance</b></p><p>  On the basis of the qualifying criteria set out in primary legislation, for administrative reasons and to obviate the necessity for taxpayers to submit annual claims and to maintain records, the Revenue Commissioners sometimes set or agree fixed amounts for some, or some elements of reliefs, allowances and deductions.  Examples include:<blockquote><b>- Flat rate expenses.</b>  Where a large number of employees incur expenses which are deductible under the provisions of section 114 TCA 1997 and which are not reimbursed by their employer, a standard flat rate expenses deduction may be agreed between Revenue and representatives of groups or classes of employees (usually the employees are represented by trade unions).  The agreed deduction is then available to all employees of the class or group in question.  This ensures that each individual is granted the same amount and ensures uniformity of approach in Revenue offices around the country.  In addition, it eliminates the necessity for individual claims to be submitted annually to Revenue.  However, this is not to say that an individual cannot make a claim over and above the agreed amount in respect of the actual amount deductible where this amount exceeds the flat rate.<br /><br /><b>- Travel &amp;amp; Subsistence rates.</b>  Reasonable vouched travel and subsistence expenses can be reimbursed to an employee on a tax free basis.  Rather than submit vouched expenses to employers, an employee may make a claim for round sum amounts once those amounts are not in excess of the civil service travel and subsistence rates, as set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<br /><br /><b>- Health expenses for children with life threatening illnesses or permanent disabilities.</b>  Tax relief under section 469 TCA 1997 is available for health expenses incurred in respect of children with life threatening illnesses (including child oncology patients), and children with permanent disabilities who require constant or regular hospital care.  Where the child is being treated at home, a flat rate of &euro;305 (for 2013), to include the cost of telephone rental and calls, may be claimed where the expenses are incurred for purposes directly connected with the treatment of the child.<br /><br /><b>- Tax relief for Guide Dogs for blind people.</b>  Where a blind person maintains a trained guide dog supplied by the Irish Guide Dog Association, a sum of &euro;825 may be claimed as a health expense under Section 469 TCA 1997.  Relief is available at the standard rate of tax.  Claimants are not requested to vouch such claims.  However, a letter from the Irish Guide Dog Association confirming that the claimant is the registered owner of a guide dog must be submitted with the first claim for relief.<br /><br /><b>- Kidney Patients.</b>  Relief for health expenses is granted in respect of certain additional expenses incurred by kidney patients as follows:-  In cases of hospital dialysis (where the patient attends hospital for treatment) the expenses incurred in travelling to and from hospital for treatment are allowed at the rate of &euro;0.17 per km.<br /><br />-  In cases of home dialysis (where the patient uses a dialysis machine at home) relief is allowed up to the following limits for 2013:<blockquote>-  Electricity used of &euro;2,006<br /><br />-  Laundry and Protective Clothing of &euro;1,935<br /><br />-  Telephone &euro;305<br /><br />-  The cost of expenses incurred in travelling to and from hospital for treatment is allowed at the rate of &euro;0.17 per km.</blockquote>-  In cases of Chronic Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis - &quot;CAPD&quot; (where the patient has treatment at home without he use of a dialysis machine) relief is allowed in respect of expenditure up to the following limits for 2013:<blockquote>-  Electricity used of &euro;1,585<br /><br />-  Telephone &euro;305<br /><br />-  The cost of expenses incurred in travelling to and from hospital for treatment is allowed at the rate of &euro;0.17 per km.</blockquote><b>- Small benefits exemption.</b>  Where an employer provides an employee with a small benefit (that is, a benefit with a value not exceeding &euro;250), PAYE and PRSI need not be applied to that benefit.  No more than one such benefit given to an employee in a tax year qualifies for such treatment.  Where a benefit exceeds &euro;250 in value, the full value of the benefit is subjected to PAYE and PRSI. </blockquote>  The idea of this administrative small benefits exemption, introduced by the Minister for Finance, was to exclude from tax items such as Christmas gifts given by an employer to employees.  This treatment does not apply to cash payments, which are taxable in full.   </p><p><b>Other Revenue interpretations and practices</b></p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners will, on occasion, issue interpretations and guidance in relation to the application of certain reliefs, benefits or deductions, particularly where there is an element of uncertainty as to the application of the law in particular circumstances.  These interpretations may be published on the Revenue Commissioners' website in Tax &amp;amp; Duty Manuals or as precedents or in Tax Briefings or e-briefs.  These interpretations do not alter the eligibility rules or payment levels; they are simply clarifications.   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></reply>

The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.   </p><p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policies, pre-retirement access to the main benefits from pension plans or schemes is not permitted, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be &quot;locked away&quot; to help fund an adequate income in retirement.   </p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal.  The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that this is a measure which was designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  For these reasons, I have no plans to extend the measure beyond AVCs.</p></reply>

A single farm payment entitlement is a chargeable asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes and once acquired it may be disposed of by way of sale, gift etc.  Accordingly, gains arising from the disposal of single farm payment entitlements are chargeable to CGT in the same way as gains made on any other chargeable assets.  Where total gains in any year do not exceed &euro;1,270 they are not chargeable to CGT.   </p><p>  With regard to the transfer of single farm payment entitlements for VAT purposes, where a payment entitlement is sold without land then VAT is due at the standard rate on the sale if the sale proceeds exceed the relevant threshold for VAT registration (currently &euro;37,500).  However, where a payment entitlement and land are sold together to a person who intends to carry on the farming business, then the sale may be treated as the transfer of a business and not subject to VAT.  There may be other less significant tax implications in certain instances.   </p><p>  Officials in my Department are considering this issue with officials from the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I do not intend to speculate on when that process might be concluded.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware Permanent TSB is not alone in seeking such approval. I am also seeking approval from the European Commission for the Restructuring Plan submitted by AIB.  While no plan has been approved, Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan. Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.   During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year. I am advised that Permanent TSB paid out over &euro;200m in mortgage lending in 2013 and that it had a market share of retail deposits of c 13%.  As a result of the progress made during 2013 Permanent TSB is now a genuine and important competitor in the retail banking market.  </p><p>  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears and has created a dedicated team to deal with those customers and to roll out various solutions to them. I am advised by Permanent TSB that during 2013 it made approximately 18,000 offers of long term sustainable solutions to customers in arrears or having difficulty with their mortgage repayments.</p><p>  The current strategy is for Permanent TSB to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.</p></reply>

His application included letters from QQI confirming the level at which they deemed his 3 City &amp;amp; Guilds qualifications would be placed on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Two of these were Level 5 and one was Level 4.  He also submitted a letter outlining his employment over an 11 year period.  As per procedure, the application was reviewed by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) with experience in both delivering and developing the apprenticeship curriculum and assessments.  The content and duration of the City &amp;amp; Guilds qualifications were fully examined.  While acknowledging the individual's experience and qualifications, it was the opinion of the SME that there was insufficient depth in the content of the short duration training courses undertaken by him to justify an exemption.</p><p>  The individual in question was notified of this decision on 3rd May 2013 and I understand SOLAS advised him that he could appeal the exemption decision.

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme. </p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.</p><p>  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.</p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.</p><p>  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim. </p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.</p><p>  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.</p><p>  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p><p>  The Department has contacted primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process. </p><p>  Schools, such as that referred to by the Deputy, that indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

Educate Together is patron for 52 (1.6%) of these schools.  7 new primary schools opened in 2013.  All 7 have a multidenominational ethos. Educate Together is patron for 3 of these schools.  One of the schools under Educate Together patronage opened as a result of the patronage divesting process.  4 new primary schools will commence operation in September 2014, all of these schools will have a multidenominational ethos. Educate Together will be patron for 2 of these schools.</p><p>  Apart from the school established in 2013 under the patronage divesting process, the other 10 new primary schools were or are being established to meet a demographic need.  The arrangements for determining patronage for such schools were announced by me in June 2011.  These arrangements, which are overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group, place a heavy focus on parental choice and they allow for the introduction or widening of diversity of school provision where parents want this.</p><p>  My Department continues to analyse demographic data to identify where further new primary schools may be required to meet demographic demands from 2015 onwards. It will be open to all patron bodies, including Educate Together, to apply for patronage of any such schools in line with the procedures outlined above.  Under the patronage divesting process, it is expected that a further 4 new primary schools will commence operation in 2014.  All of these will be under the patronage of Educate Together.  As part of this particular process, the Deputy will probably be aware that my Department surveyed 43 areas to establish the level of parental demand for a wider choice in the patronage of primary schools within these areas. The outcome of the survey indicated a viable parental demand for an alternative patron in 28 of the areas &ndash; 27 for a multidenominational English medium school and 1 for a multidenominational Irish medium school.  Early progress is being made with the expected commencement of 4 new schools under this process in 2014.  Active consideration is being given to options for divesting in the other areas concerned. As such it would not be possible to indicate the percentage or number of primary schools in the country that will be Educate Together or multidenominational schools by or after 2016.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the 30 September 2013.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  The appeal criteria are published in Circular 0007/2014.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is a 2-teacher school.  The enrolment at 30 September, 2013 was 16 pupils which entitles the school to one classroom teacher for the coming school year.  The school is projecting an enrolment of 13 pupils for 30 September, 2014.  The school submitted an appeal to the February, 2014 meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board under the small school criterion, seeking the retention of its second classroom post for the 2014/15 school year based on the projected enrolment of 13 pupils at 30 September, 2014. </p><p>  A projected enrolment of at least 20 pupils at 30 September 2014 would be required for the school to remain as a 2-teacher school.  Given that it projected just 13 pupils the appeal was deemed ineligible for consideration by the board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not meet with the appeal criteria.  The Board of Management of the school has been notified of this decision.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  If other pupils decide to enrol in the school and its projected enrolment in September 2014 increases to the required 20 pupils then it can submit a new appeal to the Appeals Board.</p><p>  My Department does not allocate classroom assistants to schools.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, in these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p></reply>

These are whole-time equivalent figures.  Furthermore this question raises three matters and I will deal with each in turn.  Firstly, all Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), whether at primary or post-primary level, are paid on the SNA salary scale which is set by the Minister for Education and Skills in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.  I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.</p><p>  Secondly, the question deals with the working hours of SNAs.  The contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) .  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.  These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time. </p><p>  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).</p><p>  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours.  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p><p>  Thirdly, I can confirm that Circular Letters M29/95 and PC11/95 are still valid circulars, however their purpose is to outline the minimum level of tuition time for students.  They do not set out the working hours for school staff.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2014/15 school year by 26th March 2014, for their consideration. Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted permission to remain provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.  Any award the applicant may be eligible for as a result of a change in her immigration status will take effect from the date on which the change occurs.  </p><p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  I have therefore arranged for the Deputy's question relating to provision at primary and post primary level in County Limerick to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  </p><p>SENOs are also a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children or on deciding the most appropriate placement for their child.  SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE has published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School.  This guide is also available on their website.</p><p>  The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Educational Welfare Services, Child and Family Agency, can be contacted at 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.  Where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p><p>  I am aware that the school referred to by the Deputy was established with temporary recognition in 2011 to cater for children with a diagnosis of ASD.  I am aware also, that there is no capacity on the existing campus to facilitate any expansion of the school.  However, my Department provided grant aid to the school in 2013 to make modifications to some existing ancillary rooms to provide additional pupil places and I understand that the school is currently making arrangements to carry out these modifications.</p></reply>

The 5 Year Construction Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified. </p><p>  My Department's overriding objective is to prioritise available funding to meet this demographic demand and to provide essential classroom accommodation where additional teachers are approved.

The current provision includes 2,768 teaching hours, provided under the Co-operation Hours scheme operated by the local ETBs.  This is equivalent to four full-time teachers.  These hours allow the ETBs to employ tutors to work in the Centres and to deliver tuition in CSPE, Reading, Literacy, Arts and Crafts, Woodwork and Home Economics.  In addition a grant of &euro;114,000 per annum is also made to the Centres to help meet the day to day running costs. </p><p>  My Department also provides significant additional targeted resources for the purpose of combating educational disadvantage and early school leaving and to provide assistance to young people at risk.  The various educational initiatives funded include intensive literacy programmes, out-of-school, after school and holiday time supports as well as special needs supports for students in schools.  It should be noted that there has been a substantial expansion of these initiatives since the establishment of the Life Centres in 1996, by the Christian Brothers.</p><p>  The difficult situation the Life Centres find themselves in arises from the withdrawal of direct funding by the Christian Brothers.  The major budgetary pressures within my Department place significant constraints on its capacity to support existing programmes and, consequently, given the significant range of educational disadvantage interventions already supported by my Department, requests for increased funding for the Cork Life Centre simply cannot be considered.</p></reply>

The report recommended that teacher education be provided in six "centres for teacher education" and that Church of Ireland College of Education would be suitably positioned to join a number of the proposed new configurations.  It is a clear objective of the restructuring that the quality of teacher education will be enhanced for all stakeholders.  The Review Panel, in its deliberations, respected and was aware of the denominational governance of Colleges of Education.  It heard a separate presentation from the Church of Ireland College of Education.  The Panel did not make any recommendations in relation to denominational matters other than to note that student teachers of any denomination, or none, are accommodated and afforded opportunities to prepare, according to their individual wishes, for the teaching of religion.</p><p>  In the course of consideration of the report, I have advised the college authorities that while I cannot support the Church of Ireland College remaining on their current campus, I am happy for them to negotiate their own destiny, consistent with their desire to protect their ethos within the broad parameters of the HEA report.  CICE has publicly signalled its intention to join DCU, St Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute and I understand that progress is well advanced in this regard.  It is of course open to any individual college to consult further with the stakeholders relevant to its own context at any time.</p><p>  My Department and the HEA are in contact with the consortia to monitor progress and a full implementation plan is expected to be submitted to HEA shortly.  I am committed to ensuring that all primary schools have a sufficient supply of appropriately trained teachers.  In this context the Deputy may wish to note that I signed the Church of Ireland College of Education Order under the Employment Equality Act 1998 (section 12) last year.  This Order permits the College to reserve 32 places in the first year of the Bachelor of Education degree course for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or who belong to the broad Protestant tradition during the academic years 2012/13 to 2017/18 inclusive.</p></reply>

With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Primary School Census 2011, 2012 and 2013 included a question which asked a school to indicate if they operate a textbook rental or loan scheme to enable pupils and parents to rent or borrow some or all of the main textbooks used in the school.  Schools that indicated that they did not  operate a book rental or loan scheme in the Primary School Census in 2013 were contacted in early 2014 to advise them of the application process.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.

There are now a number of different rates of PSPR applicable, depending on the size of the pension and the pensioner's date of retirement relative to the applicable date of the various pay cuts that have applied to public servants in recent years.</p><p>  Pensioners with public service pension income below &euro;12,000 are in all cases exempt from PSPR.  In respect of retirements up to 29 February 2012, PSPR reduces all affected public service pensions on the basis of either of two sets of rates.  First, for pre-March 2012 retirement on pension up to &euro;34,132, the following PSPR rates apply to the pension (these rates also applied to pre-March 2012 pensions above &euro;34,132 prior to PSPR rate increases which took effect on 1 July 2013):  Up to &euro;12,000: Exempt - Any amount over &euro;12,000 but not over &euro;24,000: 6 per cent (&euro;720) Any amount over &euro;24,000 but not over &euro;60,000: 9 per cent (&euro;3,240) Any amount over &euro;60,000 but not over &euro;100,000: 12 per cent (&euro;4,800) Any amount over &euro;100,000: 20 per cent.</p><p>  Second, for pre-March 2012 retirement on pension above &euro;34,132, the following PSPR rates apply to the pension: Up to &euro;12,000: Exempt - Any amount over &euro;12,000 but not over &euro;24,000: 8 per cent (&euro;960) Any amount over &euro;24,000 but not over &euro;60,000: 12 per cent (&euro;4,320) Any amount over &euro;60,000 but not over &euro;100,000: 17 per cent (&euro;6,800) Any amount over &euro;100,000: 28 per cent.</p><p>  For pensioners who retired after 29 February 2012, and for public servants who retire up to the end of the &quot;grace period&quot; in respect of the pay reductions that applied to higher paid public servants on 1 July 2013, in each case on pensions in excess of &euro;32,500 only, the following PSPR rates apply to the pension: Up to &euro;12,000: Exempt - Any amount over &euro;12,000 but not over &euro;24,000: 2 per cent (&euro;240) Any amount over &euro;24,000 but not over &euro;60,000: 3 per cent (&euro;1,080) Any amount over &euro;60,000 but not over &euro;100,000: 5 per cent (&euro;2,000) Any amount over &euro;100,000: 8 per cent.</p><p>  In respect of each of the three sets of PSPR rates, the reduction rates relate to the amount of pension income in each of the bands and are therefore progressive in its application.  PSPR is estimated to yield some &euro;125 million annually in support of the fiscal position, based on the foreseen full-year outcome associated with the PSPR rates in force following the PSPR rate adjustments on 1 July 2013, which were legislated under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  Prior to these rate adjustments, the full-year yield from PSPR is estimated to have been of the order of &euro;100 million.  However information on the amount arising from the reduction applied to those pensions falling into each band relative to each rate is not available in my Department. </p></reply>

This National Monument is currently the subject of a significant project designed to improve elements of its presentation and to provide greater access for those with limited mobility.  The presentation works involve provision of new and improved signage on site and the access works relate to the provision of new and extended universal access via pathways and a boardwalk on site.  The carpark at the site is also being extensively improved and resurfaced.</p><p>  This project had been planned since early last year but given that it involves practically all of the site and having regard to adverse weather for the past several months, it was not feasible to commence until now.  The works will take about 8 weeks to complete commencing immediately after Easter.  Thereafter the site will reopen to the public as normal with Guided services available for the remainder of the season up to the 24th September.</p><p>  The OPW National Monument Service is anxious to promote and market the National Monument sites in its care and, in this regard, Mellifont Abbey is a key location on the Boyne Valley Drive launched in 2012 to promote and facilitate tourism in the region.  The works being undertaken at Mellifont are a direct response to the Boyne Valley Drive initiative and recognise the importance of the site to the route.  The aim of the project is to ensure that visitors to the site, and particularly those very many people who visit when Guides are absent, can enjoy and access the site more fully.  The provision of a fulltime Guide Service is a significant, and costly, step.  The resources available to the OPW for the delivery of Guide services remain under significant pressure and there are therefore no long term plans to extend the Guide service at Old Mellifont Abbey beyond the current seasonal offering.</p></reply>

One significant area of co-operation is in relation to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme which the OPW is currently undertaking with its technical consultants and in partnership with local and regional authorities and other key stakeholders including Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries Ireland, the ESB and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The CFRAM Programme is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  Under the Programme, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design.  These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan.  More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p><p>  The core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Study.  The Shannon CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.  The Shannon River Basin District covers some 17,800kms2 and includes parts of 17 counties.  A total of 66 locations along the Shannon have been identified for further assessment under the Study.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin.</p><p>  Under the Study, work on Draft Flood Maps will be finalised during 2014 and Flood Risk Management Plans are due to be finalised in 2015.  It is not possible at this point to state when any specific measures recommended in the CFRAM study will be implemented.  Pending the finalisation of the CFRAM Plan, it is open to any of the local authorities adjoining the Shannon to apply to the OPW under its Minor Works Scheme for funding to assist with any small scale  localised measures that the local authorities consider may help to alleviate flooding along the river.  Any application received will be assessed under the Scheme's eligibility criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  Application forms and related guidelines are available on the OPW website under Flood Risk Management.</p><p>  The Shannon CFRAM Study involves public consultation with individuals and organisations who have an interest in the Shannon including property owners, recreational users, the farming community and environmental stakeholders.  Consultations to date include the national public consultation process that took place during 2011 as part of the CFRAM Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment.  The Shannon CFRAM Stakeholder Group met in October 2011 on the subject of Strategic Environmental Assessment.  Two Public Open Days on the Shannon CFRAM Study were held in Athlone during April 2012.  Presentations on the Shannon CFRAM Study were provided at local/regional authority meetings during December 2012 to June 2013.  Public Information Days on Draft Flood Maps were held in Borrisokane, Co. Tipperary and Mullingar, Co. Westmeath during October 2013.  The extensive consultation with stakeholder groups under the study is a recognition of the multifaceted nature of the Shannon river system and its diverse uses and functions.  More information is available on the project website www.shannoncframstudy.ie.</p></reply>

BGE and the buyer consortium must now move to deliver on the conditions for completion of this transaction, including a restructuring of the energy business into three separate companies and the completion of a number of regulatory processes, and it is currently expected that the sale will be completed within Q2 2014.</p><p>  The final sale price and net receipts to the State will be subject to adjustments at completion for certain balance sheet items, such as  net debt and working capital, and the level of certain of BG Energy's earnings from 1 January 2014 to completion (the value of which will be retained by BGE).  The Board of BGE will then begin paying special dividends to the Exchequer, commencing immediately following completion, as funds are both available and required.

Under the legislation industrial and provident societies and friendly societies may register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, subject to a range of obligations in relation to such registration.  Principally, these include the following obligations: to register their rules and the titles and names of officers; to submit an annual return to the Registrar, specifying the receipts and expenditure, funds and effects of the society (as well as a copy of the audited accounts of the society); to submit a copy of all alterations of rules, new rules, and change of officers made during the previous year, and; to maintain a registered office and to notify the Registrar of any change in the registered office.</p><p>  Breaches of the Acts may be dealt with by the imposition of a fine (where an offence has been committed) or by cancellation of the registry of a society.  Offences include (but are not limited to) a failure to give notice, send any return or document, not allow anything to be done or sent which the Acts require; wilfully neglecting or refusing to furnish information required under the Acts; furnishing false or insufficient information; a refusal to attend or produce documents in relation to a dispute.  The Registrar may cancel the registration of a society where it has been obtained by fraud or mistake, or where a society has wilfully and after notice from the Registrar violated any of the provisions of the Acts.</p><p>  In relation to disputes there is provision under both codes of legislation for the parties to a dispute, by consent, to refer a dispute to the Registrar, unless the rules of the society expressly forbid such a referral.  The Registrar may, with the consent of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, hear and determine such dispute, and may order the expenses of determining same to be paid out or the funds of the society or by such parties to the dispute as she thinks fit.</p><p>  In the case of industrial and provident societies, the Registrar also has (with the consent of the Minister) power to appoint an inspector or inspectors to examine into and report on the affairs of a society, or to call a special meeting of the society, upon application to her by one tenth of the number of members of a society, or of one hundred members in the case of a society exceeding one thousand members.  While I have set out briefly the broad detail of the main provisions in relation to the areas raised by the Deputy there are some differences between the bodies of legislation in the procedures applicable to friendly societies and industrial and provident societies, and the Acts should be read carefully in respect of each individual type of society to determine the rules applicable.</p></reply>

I will continue to pursue relevant and appropriate initiatives through the North South Ministerial Council.</p><p>  The concept of a specific Border Development Zone as a means of fostering economic recovery in the cross-border region of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was the main theme of a conference organised by the <i>Centre for Cross Border Studies </i>(CCBS) and the <i>International Centre for Local and Regional Development </i>  (ICLRD) in January last. This follows the development of this concept in the CCBS-sponsored Bradley/Best economic study of 2012 and I am aware that the CCBS has undertaken research on the topic in the intervening period also.</p><p>I strongly believe that it is important to continue building on what has already been achieved in the region by the relevant State bodies and by local authorities on both sides of the border.  The work of the Cross Border Body, <i>InterTrade Ireland,</i> has been foremost in this regard, with a significant range of enterprise development initiatives and programmes in place. My Department jointly funds and provides oversight to this Body, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast and it represents a very effective mechanism for tackling business development on an all-island basis. In addition, there is on-going co-operation between <i>Enterprise Ireland</i> and its Northern Ireland counterpart agency, <i>Invest Northern Ireland</i>   on areas of mutual interest. </p><p>  A further useful mechanism has been the work of organisations such as <i>the Irish Central Border Area Network,</i> the <i>North West Region Cross Border Group</i><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>and <i>East Border Region Ltd.</i>   These organisations involve local authorities on both sides of the border working together to pursue the specific needs of communities in their regions.  They have the experience and local knowledge to assist with driving future development strategies of mutual interest.  Indeed, the projects led by such groups, and others, under the Enterprise Development theme of the INTERREG IVA Programme (2009-2015), have made a significant impact on developing small businesses in the region.   My Department co-funds the Enterprise Development strand of this INTERREG Programme, under which a total of 29 individual projects have been initiated. Work is underway on devising the format of the next strand of the INTERREG Programme for the period up to 2020, and my Department is involved in that process. </p><p>  The concept of initiating a Border Development Zone in the border region is an interesting proposal.  However it could raise significant issues involving EU State Aid Rules and other EU provisions and it would also, of course, require detailed negotiations between both Administrations on this island.  There would also, almost certainly, be significant resource issues.  For these reasons, and while I will of course keep abreast of the ongoing research by the CCBS, I do not envisage the establishment of such a zone as being practical or realistic at this time, especially given the existing, well-developed arrangements which are in place, as set out above.  </p></reply>

Rather, Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees legally employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example; the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 requires any persons under a contract of employment to be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.  For the purposes of this Act, this means a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p><p>  There is a general understanding that an au pair is a student or young adult who travels to a foreign country to live with a family, learn the local language and culture and undertakes limited childcare and light household duties.  They normally receive a small sum of money from the host family.  Non-EU nationals wishing to take up a role as an au pair in Ireland require a visa from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which comes within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, while the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has general responsibility for childcare matters.  My Department has no oversight role vis-&agrave;-vis au pairs, except where there are concerns over whether or not an employment relationship might exist.</p><p>  Where the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which comes within the remit of my Department, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, NERA will investigate with a view to establishing the person's statutory entitlements under employment law (including whether the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is being used to avoid statutory obligations).  NERA has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees.  </p><p>  I have no plans to make changes to the existing body of employment rights legislation in this context and the question as to whether a person is an employee or not is determined by NERA within the provisions of existing employment legislation and established contract law.</p><p>Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter can be reported to the NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to employment rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at .  NERA has a dedicated information service, Workplace Relations Customer Service, which provides information on all aspects of employment rights.  This service operates from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and can be contacted on Lo-Call 1890 808090.  Workplace Relations Customer Service also provides extensive information on its website www.workplacerelations.ie.</p></reply>

There are 105 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Westmeath employing 2,610 people on a full time basis.  Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the Midlands and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Athlone to build the research capabilities in the Region. In addition, the Community Enterprise Centres, funded through Enterprise Ireland, are providing enterprise space to cater for micro enterprises throughout Longford.  Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;0.56m in 2013 for companies in Longford and made payments of over &euro;1.06m to companies in Longford during the same period.  Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;1.21m in 2013 for companies in Westmeath and made payments of over &euro;1.62m to companies in Westmeath during the same period.</p><p>  Currently, the IDA positions the Midlands as having a strong cluster in Medical Technologies and Life Sciences (Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, AMS) and International Business Services (Teleflex, AXA, NPD Group and PPD).  These international brands are an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate to the Midlands.  </p><p>  Recent examples of where the cluster benefits investment decisions is the announcement of Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Monksland, outside Athlone and American Medical Systems in Athlone, who are already seeking planning permission to expand after only two years. As well as the FDI sector, this cluster is supported by over 600 people employed in Medical Technologies related industries from the indigenous sector, in areas such as manufacturing to delivery of parts of the supply chain. The arrival of Jazz Pharmaceuticals to Monksland and the announcement of investment from Alexion Pharma combined with the existing presence of Alkermes, employing 400 staff identifies a new cluster in the Midlands in bio pharmaceuticals and this will be presented to potential new name companies in the market place.  </p><p>  In addition, the approval to build a 25,000 sq.ft. ATB in Athlone will provide an enhanced platform to attract FDI to the Midlands.</p><p>  In 2013, the IDA Ireland scheme &ldquo;Succeed in Ireland&rdquo; with Ark Consulting announced the creation of 10 jobs, to be located in Longford.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the CEB's will shortly be dissolved and established as  Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) within Longford and Westmeath County Councils, as part of the reform of the model of supports for the micro-enterprise sector.  The LEO will integrate the business support and enterprise development functions of the Council with an enhanced range of existing CEB functions, such as making it easier to obtain the full support of Revenue, Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Review Office, Skillnets and the Education and Training Boards.  This reform will result in the provision of the best possible service to people who have a business idea. </p><p>  The role of Longford and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) as part of the CEB/LEO network is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises employing 10 or less people. </p><p>  In 2013, Longford County Enterprise Board approved financial assistance totalling &euro;352,000 in respect of 39 projects, with a further &euro;63,000 allocated to 7 projects so far this year. In addition, last year the Board held 30 training courses, with over 330 participants. In 2014, the CEB/LEO will continue to provide a full range of training and mentoring supports, including a forthcoming Management Skills course, as well as its ongoing Management Development Programme and its Women in Business Network, etc.</p><p>  Last year, Westmeath County Enterprise Board approved financial assistance totalling &euro;596,213 in respect of 32 projects, over half (53%) of which were new businesses. In addition, the Board allocated &euro;257,931 towards enterprise development activities, which comprised of business training courses, schools programmes, mentoring, exhibition assistance, website grants, exporting grants and business networking events. Westmeath CEB facilitated 980 people in business training in 2013. </p><p>  In 2014, Westmeath CEB/LEO will be hosting a range of training courses and events, including number of Start Your Own Business courses, information sessions on developing your business idea, current business topics, financial management, marketing courses, social networking, management development courses and business networking events in 2014. </p><p>  Finally, I should point out that under action 117 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, my Department as well as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have been tasked with the development of a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of enterprise agencies and the other regional stakeholders in building enterprise based on sustainable competitive advantage of the region. This framework for enterprise development, using the Midlands as a template is expected for delivery in the second quarter 2014. </p><p>  Building and developing an ecosystem supportive of enterprise at a regional level is vital for economic growth and sustainable job creation. Regional development is central in Enterprise Ireland's role supporting the growth of Irish enterprise. With the advent of the new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), Enterprise Ireland will now have a greater role to play in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Agency that there are 5 IDA personnel based in Waterford with client facing and regional responsibilities.  These staff work with the existing client base in the South East Region to ensure their ongoing sustainability and growth and facilitate new name client itineraries into the Region.  They also work with key stakeholders to ensure that the Region has a competitive and ever improving offering. </p><p>The success of this strategy is borne out by the two significant investments won for Waterford during 2013.    In February 2013, Sanofi announced plans to invest &euro;44m in Genzyme's biotechnology campus in Waterford.  This investment will increase the site's diversity of products and comes on top of a &euro;150m investment a little more than a year previously.  The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company's latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site's value to the company.  In March 2013, Nypro Healthcare announced plans to establish an additional state of the art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 new high quality jobs in the coming years.</p><p>  Furthermore, in order to improve the offering in the Region to win new business, IDA Ireland has signed contracts for the construction of an advanced manufacturing facility in Waterford.  This facility, which will be 2,348 sq metres in area, will be located in the IDA Technology Park at Butlerstown and will be completed by year end.  The building design has taken account of the flexibility requirement of potential end users by creating a front of house open plan area with an open plan production area to the rear offering large scale flexibility for either large scale open plan use or the potential to subdivide or introduce cellular spaces.</p><p>  In addition IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focusing on the South East Region and Waterford (Connect and Invest Waterford).  Initiatives such as this can enhance the marketability of the location for investment at a very early stage in a perspective client's decision-making process. </p><p>  IDA Ireland remains a key supporter of the South East Employment Action Plan which brings together a number of stakeholders in addressing the persistent employment challenges faced in the South East Region.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland is committed to helping companies strengthen their export readiness and export selling capabilities.  The Agency offers customised training and access to experts, matched to a company's level of export awareness in order to save time and money and increase their chances of export success.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland organises &ldquo;Export Awareness Events&rdquo; regularly in a number of locations around Ireland.  These<b></b>short (typically two-hour duration) workshops are aimed at companies thinking of exporting for the first time.  In 2013, &ldquo;Export Awareness Events&rdquo; were held across the regions with 362 companies / 412 individuals participating in the events.<b>  Table 1 </b>below identifies the regional areas involved together with the<b></b>number of companies and individuals who participated.  <b>Table 2</b> below provides details in respect of 2014 (year to date) where Export Awareness Events were held in Cork and Sligo with 49 companies/64 individuals participating in the events.</p><p>  &ldquo;Exploring Exporting Workshops&rdquo; is a series of workshops, focused on helping first-time exporting companies become export ready.  Topics include: conducting market research, defining the export value-proposition, processes for exporting and, the exportable offer.  Business mentors are available to work with client companies to identify the issues they need to address to become export ready. </p><p>In 2013, &ldquo;Exploring Exporting Workshops&rdquo; were held across the regions with 129 companies/172 individuals participating in the workshops.  <b>Table 3</b> below outlines the regional areas involved together with the number of companies and individuals who participated.  To date in 2014, one &ldquo;Exploring Exporting Workshop&rdquo; was held in Cork with 15 companies/20 individuals participating. A further 8 Workshops will take place throughout the year. </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is also involved in &ldquo;Meet the UK Market Team&rdquo; initiative.  This is an opportunity for those companies that have made progress in developing their export market capability to meet face-to-face with the EI UK market team to gain insights into market specific opportunities and challenges relating to their business.  Three workshops with the UK market team will be held in 2014 in Cork, Dublin and Galway.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Export Awareness Events 2013</b><table><tr><th>Awareness Events &ndash; Location </th><th>Month</th><th>No of Companies</th><th>No of Participants </th></tr><tr><td>Clonakilty</td><td>January </td><td>28</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>February </td><td>40</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>February</td><td>62</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>February </td><td>54</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>May </td><td>27</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>June </td><td>18</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>September</td><td>26</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>September </td><td>50</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>October </td><td>37</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>October </td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Total     10</td><td>#</td><td>362</td><td>412</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2  - Export Awareness Events 2014 (year to date)</b><table><tr><th>Awareness Events &ndash; Location </th><th>Month</th><th>No of Companies</th><th>No of Participants </th></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>February</td><td>33</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>March </td><td>16</td><td>20</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3 - Exploring Exporting Workshops 2013</b><table><tr><th>Workshop Location</th><th>Month</th><th>No of Companies</th><th>No of Participants</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>March</td><td>13</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>March</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td>April  </td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>April</td><td>9</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>May </td><td>17</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>June </td><td>13</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td>September </td><td>10</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>September </td><td>13</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin  </td><td>October  </td><td>15</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>October  </td><td>9</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>December </td><td>15</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Total      11 </td><td>#</td><td>129</td><td>172</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Department has an agreement with the companies in terms of compensation for the costs incurred on the basis of fares forgone.

Revised arrangements were announced as part of Budget 2014 to apply to older jobseeking clients.  The measures provide for these clients to continue to avail of Departmental supports on a voluntary basis should they wish to return to work, training or education.  In addition, provision is made for these clients to receive their payments directly into an account in a financial institution if they so wish.  I understand that some 17,000 letters were issued to such clients between late 2013 to date.  These letters, which were issued predominantly in 2014, are designed to ease the transition from working age to retirement. Some additional one hundred clients in receipt of rent supplement, who already receive their primary income support by EFT, were contacted advising them of the option to have the rent payment paid directly into an account. The Department does not maintain statistics on the total number of clients who took up this option.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.</p><p>  Currently a person's date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes. To qualify for a state pension a person must:</p><p>  - have entered insurance before the age of 66;</p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions; and</p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and/or credited is required for a full rate pension). </p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is means tested, may be made in respect of an adult dependant who does not qualify for a pension in their own right, or who qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in his/her insurance.  The means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria. </p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The system was designed to ensure that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately rather than waiting for contributions to build up and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was less comprehensive and people could move in and out of coverage as a result of the nature of their employment and/or earnings.   Social insurance is now long established and is comprehensive in terms of the workforce covered. </p><p>  It is planned to move to a total contributions approach to determine pension eligibility in the future.  This would entail a situation where the total number of contributions paid over a working life will closely reflect the rate of payment received.  For example, 30 years contributions (1,560) could qualify a person for maximum State pension (contributory). A person would accumulate 1/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30/30ths inclusive of a certain number of credits.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out a roadmap payment developments over the coming years.  It followed a root and branch examination of the Department's payment processes and approaches, reflecting changing consumer preferences and the need to deliver greater economies and efficiencies to the Department and the economy at large.   The Strategy aims to remove the limits that cash payments impose on our clients in terms of making onward financial transactions and availing of discounted prices online while also continuing to serve those who are more vulnerable in our society.</p><p>  The Strategy is aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan, which highlighted the criticality of moving to electronic payments in reducing the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy with its consequential impacts on costs and competitiveness.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also the extent to which it is now a one stop shop where people can pay bills and undertake a number of other financial and banking transactions and services. The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government and Minister Rabbitte has made a number of statements recently in the D&aacute;il referring to this.   At a recent presentation to a D&aacute;il committee, An Post spoke of its plans to grow their existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.</p><p>  For my part, I was happy to support the post office services with the signing of a new contract last December following an EU-wide procurement competition.   The contract will be worth in excess of &euro;50 million to An Post this year.  The Department will continue to accommodate its clients in exercising their choice of electronic payments where this is possible in the interests of economy, efficiency and national competitiveness.</p></reply>

Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.</p><p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41.  In addition, a new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office.  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also under way in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have achieved significant improvements.  The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400.  The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This overall improvement has continued in 2013 with the processing time reducing to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  In addition to the improvements in processing times mentioned above, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 13,993 at 31 March 2014.</p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  While I accept that this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  However, where an appellant's means are insufficient to meet their needs pending the determination of their appeal, it is open to them to apply for a means-tested Supplementary Allowance payment.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

The farm assist scheme is based on jobseeker's allowance.  It was introduced in 1999 to replace 'Smallholders Unemployment Assistance' for low income farmers.  Farm assist recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p><p>  Changes under Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the treatment of self-employed persons under jobseeker's allowance and the scheme is kept under ongoing review by my officials.  It may be noted that the changes related to the assessment of means under the scheme &ndash; rates of farm assist have been maintained so there has been no change in the level of support being given to farm families with the lowest incomes.</p><p>  My officials are in regular contact with the Irish Farmers Association with regard to issues arising in relation to the farm assist scheme.  At present there are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

A national monument becomes subject to the Ministerial consent requirements under section 14 of the 1930 Act if:</p><p>  -	it is owned by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or a local authority;</p><p>  -	it is under the guardianship of the Minister or a local authority under sections 5, 6 or 9 of the 1930 Act; or</p><p>  -	it is subject to a Preservation Order under section 8 of the 1930 Act or a temporary Preservation Order under section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1954.</p><p>  Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a Preservation Order under section 8 of the 1930 Act.  The Preservation Order was made on the grounds that the protection of No.16 is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  To achieve that objective the Order also covers Nos. 14, 15 and 17 Moore Street and includes the yards to the rear of Nos. 15 and 16, extending to Nos. 8 and 9 Moore Lane.

SEAI periodically promotes the scheme through direct marketing to those households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance. </p><p>  The Better Energy Communities and the Better Energy Areas schemes assist in upgrading the energy efficiency of existing clusters of buildings, homes and community facilities.  The schemes are delivered by partnerships and community based organisations who must bid for funding from SEAI. </p><p>  In total, &euro;57 million has been provided to SEAI in 2014 to operate these retrofit schemes.

The independent panel will have power to commission its own work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies presented.</p><p>  The Panel has commenced its deliberations including considering what work, if any, it might usefully undertake in relation to the North South Transmission Line project.  I understand that no decision has as yet been made by the Panel in that regard.  It is worth noting that detailed studies have already been conducted for the North South transmission line, including consideration of a route specific underground option and, most recently, an assessment by a previous Independent International Commission of Experts appointed in July 2011 which reported in February 2012.  Previously, in 2009, the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commissioned an independent study on Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines versus Underground Cables.  That study was conducted by international consultants Ecofys. </p><p>  I understand that EirGrid has taken full account of the contents of those studies in finalising the planning application for the North South transmission line.  The timing of the submission of the planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a matter for EirGrid.</p><p>  EirGrid published an interim report on the emerging themes from the Grid Link project consultation on 28 January.  A copy of this report is available on the EirGrid website at .  All of the submissions which EirGrid received on the project are being examined by the EirGrid project team.  I understand that once a thorough and detailed examination of all the submissions has been completed, a report will be published on the project website and EirGrid will respond to all correspondence as quickly as possible.</p><p>  EirGrid made an announcement on 28 March 2014 in relation to the<i></i>extensive public consultation which it has carried out over the past 20 months on its Grid25 projects.  Arising from feedback which was received that the consultation process could be improved, EirGrid has initiated a thorough review of its consultation process to improve future public engagement.  I am advised that the review will include an external review of Eirgrid's consultation and engagement processes. To ensure the independence and objectivity of the review, EirGrid has requested the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators to provide experienced professionals to undertake the review.  As part of this external review, a number of stakeholders will be asked for their views on the consultation that EirGrid has carried out and how future consultations could be improved.  This will be done to ensure that the widest possible views are included in the review.  The overall review is expected to be completed by June and its findings will be published, including recommendations to improve future public engagement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-01a.609.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040100064#WRM03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 326 together. </p><p>  Since market liberalisation in 1999, broadband services are delivered in the first instance by private sector operators who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Clare, can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg's website at  as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The State can only become involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Clare, NBS services are available within 49 of its 155 Electoral Divisions. </p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) which was launched in 2011 aimed to make a basic broadband service available to individual unserved premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS, notwithstanding the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland.  A total of 155 applicants from County Clare qualified under the Scheme and received offers of service from the service providers participating in the Scheme.  Of these, 30 applicants accepted an offer of service.  My Department was advised by the participating service providers that they had been unable to provide service to 2 applicants in County Clare. Engineering officials from my Department visited those 2 households in May 2013 and provided advice, having assessed the local topography, on possible terrestrial and satellite providers who could provide a solution. Further information was provided to them in September last and my Department has had no follow-up requests for information or advice.</p><p>  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Clare.  This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also facilitate the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 30 locations in County Clare before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, mapping data which has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned next generation broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, including County Clare.</p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country.

The decision to undertake such developments are operational matters based on commercial decisions by the individual companies and are not undertaken at my direction, as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>  However, financing arrangements for wind farm projects do form an integral part of the standard approvals for capital expenditure sought by the companies within my area of responsibility. Such approvals are considered and provided by my Department on foot of formal applications from the individual companies, in the context of relevant delegated authority protocols.</p><p>  BG&Eacute; and ESB have significant portfolios of wind generation assets, some already operational, others in development. BG&Eacute;'s energy business, which comprises the wind assets portfolio, is part of the State Assets Disposal Programme, to be sold to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP, as part of a consortium that also comprises Centrica plc and iCON Infrastructure. The transaction process is at an advanced stage and is expected to conclude in the coming months.</p><p>  BnM has made significant investment in wind energy projects such as the Mount Lucas project in County Offaly and Bruckana in County Tipperary. In addition, BnM, in conjunction with ESB, has formed a joint venture company to develop a wind farm at Oweninny in County Mayo.</p><p>  Consideration is currently being given to the potential for a collaborative approach to wind energy development by BnM and Coillte. The outcome of detailed analysis, led by NewERA, on such a collaborative approach, is expected shortly.</p></reply>

However, it is recognised that the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and the key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, would make 2020 delivery very difficult to achieve given project lead times.

The overall dog control provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 contain important and balanced requirements for all dog owners, irrespective of breed.  In particular, the legislation sets out the requirement for owners to accompany and keep effectual control of their dogs.  The penalty for non-conformance with these requirements is a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to three months. </p><p>  The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 (as amended) require that specific breeds of dogs must be muzzled, leashed and led by a competent person over 16 years of age when in public.  These requirements on specific breeds are a balanced and workable arrangement which recognise the rights of dog owners versus the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury.</p></reply>

The rates of duty currently applicable to the quarterly and half-yearly discs are 28.25 % and 55.5 % of the annual rate, respectively.  These relativities have remained generally constant since the 1960s.   </p><p>  Non-annual transactions make up over two-thirds of all motor transactions processed.  Tax rates for these vehicles take account of the extra workload for the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) and motor tax offices, and the resultant higher administrative and printing costs.  In addition, reminders are issued on each renewal.  While costs may have reduced in respect of those paying on-line, they are not negligible.  Moving from a system of setting the additional charge for quarterly and half-yearly payments as a percentage of tax payable to a flat fee would mean increases in overall costs for those paying lower rates of motor tax, and decreases in payments by those paying higher rates of tax, for the same quantum of tax collected.  This could be regressive, for example in respect of those who can afford only to drive a smaller car compared to those who can afford to drive a larger car.   </p><p>  The annual income from the increased charges for three and six month discs in 2012 was over &euro;50m.  A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.</p></reply>

Since the late 1980s, close to 25,000 units of accommodation have been provided under capital funding schemes underpinned by 20 and 30 year mortgages.  More recently, a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years.</p><p>  Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto</i> owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  My Department cannot unilaterally make provision for their sale to tenants.  Any such decision would have to involve the AHB and have regard to the mortgage on the property.  On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property.</p><p>  In relation to a regulatory framework for the sector, <i>Building for the Future, a Voluntary Regulation Code</i> was introduced in July 2013 as a precursor to a statutory regulatory framework to support the sector's long-term growth.  In February 2014, I appointed an interim Regulatory Committee (iRC) to oversee the implementation of the voluntary code and to advise on the development of statutory regulation. </p><p> Regulation is an important element in providing the conditions necessary for the growth and development of the sector.  Financing that growth is equally important and the question of how best to utilise the existing asset base, including the option of selling existing stock to tenants, is a factor to be considered.</p></reply>

I recognise the quality and caring emergency ambulance service provided by Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB) across most of the greater Dublin area, including the strength of its experience, infrastructure and personnel.  There are significant issues, however, including the funding arrangements associated with DFB's provision of services on behalf of the HSE, which need to be addressed.  Involvement in other areas of work should not compromise DFB's capacity to provide fire services or impose additional costs on the local authorities.  I am aware that a review has been commissioned by the HSE and Dublin City Council regarding the emergency ambulance service provided by DFB.  It is appropriate that all public services should be reviewed from time to time to ensure that they are fit for purpose and provide value for money.  I look forward to the outcome of the review and its contribution to the development of a strategy which will continue to provide a high quality ambulance service to the people of Dublin. </p></reply>

Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.</p><p>  The profession of Architectural Technologist is not a regulated profession in Ireland.  However, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. This would enable a person so registered to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under S.I. No. 9 of 2014. </p><p>  The Building Control Act of 2007 also provides for routes to inclusion on the statutory registers of Architects or Building Surveyors in respect of non-academically qualified persons who are practically trained. </p><p>  Persons who have been engaged in the design of buildings but who are not registered should contact the designated registration bodies (i.e. Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland or Engineers Ireland) with a view to identifying the most appropriate route to registration appropriate to their own individual circumstances. </p><p>  I tasked Mr Garrett Fennell, Solicitor, to carry out a review of the routes to entry to the statutory register.  Mr Fennell submitted his report to me last September and I intend to implement the report recommendations in full. This should ease access to the register, especially for practically trained persons. </p></reply>

The position remains unchanged. I will make arrangements to have the letter of 5 February 2014 received from the Minister for Education and Skills, referred to in the reply, placed in the Oireachtas Library.  This is the only written representation I received from another Minister in relation to this matter.</p><p>  As indicated, my Department consulted with relevant Departments/ agencies represented on the Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC), in relation to the implications of the Regulations for the public capital programme.  Several Departments/Agencies, including the Department of Education and Skills, the National Development Finance Agency and the Health Services Executive, expressed concerns that the new requirements may cause delays in the Public Capital Programme.  Large-scale public infrastructure projects, in particular, are prone to costly delays due to strict national and EU procurement rules which do not generally apply to private sector projects.  Other agencies, notably the OPW, reported that the necessary arrangements were in place to administer contracts in accordance with the new requirements.</p><p>  I understand that the Office of Government Procurement at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has issued <i>Guidance Note 1.1.1 &ndash; Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 &ndash; Procurement Implications for Contracting Authorities.</i>  Concerns in relation to the clarity and definition of the Assigned Certifier on public procurement projects do not therefore arise. </p><p>  Outside of the application of the Building Control (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2014, my Department will liaise closely with industry stakeholders and relevant Departments/agencies in order to ensure that no unforeseen difficulties will arise in relation to the delivery of large scale capital investment projects. </p></reply>

This agreement outlines that the Service Level Agreement will include a programme to improve the efficiencies in water services operations, including investment in infrastructure and new technologies, training and up-skilling, and reflecting best practice in standard operating procedures and processes.  Each Service Level Agreement in place with a Local Authority is supported by an Annual Service Plan which reflects the required programme of transformation for that authority.

This will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities from their own resources and general purpose grants.  Within this overall framework, the agreement of budgets with local authorities and the payments for services provided are matters for Irish Water.

Government is responding to these needs through a variety of mechanisms and more flexible funding models.  To maximise the social housing gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social housing gain from private developments.  Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisitions and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease. </p><p>  In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587 million, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.  This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.   </p><p>  Last month I announced the approval of some 56 social housing construction projects with an overall value of some &euro;68 million under the Local Authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015.  This new construction programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list.  Projects were selected for approval on the basis of the proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities, the relative priority afforded to each of these projects and the overall level of housing need locally.  In the case of Kerry County Council, some &euro;1.8 million was approved in respect of a proposal submitted by the Council for the construction of 13 dwellings, 8 of which are in Park, Killarney. </p><p>  On Budget Day 2014, I announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing some 400 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use.  My Department is currently assessing the proposals recently received from local authorities and I will announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible.      </p><p>  I also intend to announce details very shortly of the allocations to local authorities under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of need over the 2014-2015 period.

This new construction programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list.  Projects were selected for funding approval on the basis of the proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities, the relative priority afforded to each of these projects and the overall level of housing need locally.</p><p>  The 35 unit development at Darndale was included as one of the projects to be advanced under this programme.  The &euro;7.9 million provisional allocation for this project is an indicative figure based on the cost estimate provided by Dublin City Council.  In view of the fact that the procurement process for the construction contract for this large project has not been completed so far, I do not propose to make public any cost-sensitive information which might impact on the tendering process at this time.

I intend to make regulations in the coming months so as to provide for new arrangements in determining local authority rents and in doing so am minded to set a standard minimum weekly rent payable for a local authority dwelling at the same level as the minimum weekly contribution that rent supplement beneficiaries are currently required to pay towards the rent of their accommodation.  My intention is that households on higher incomes will pay higher rent on that account.  Housing authorities will also be empowered, under section 31 of the 2009 Act, to make a charge in the rent for specified works and services provided to dwellings. </p></reply>

The CER will be responsible for approving, with or without modifications, the water charges plan which will set out the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers.  </p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.  The group comprises officials from my Department and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  A report will be submitted for consideration by Government based on the group's examination of the issues involved and the Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to affordability and the free allowance.  </p><p>  The Government has committed to the provision of a free allowance, above which charging based on usage would apply.  The free allowance and the level of funding to be provided by the Government to Irish Water will have a strong bearing on the net charges to be met by households.  Consequently, decisions on these matters will provide greater visibility on the expected level of charges in advance of the final determination of all aspects of the water charges plan by the CER.  I expect to bring proposals to Government in this regard shortly. </p><p>  The CER will announce its decision on the approved water charges plan in August 2014.  In making its decision on the approval or otherwise of the first water charges plan, the CER will take into account the decisions made by Government on the funding model for Irish Water, including the funding available for a free allowance and any proposed affordability measures.   </p></reply>

Comprehensive consultation documents were published, including <b><i>Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012</i></b><b>,</b><b>which sets out the context in which the reforms &ndash; as later signed into law in the form of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 &ndash; would operate and the regulatory impact of these for building owners and industry stakeholders. This document remains available on my Department's website, </b>.</p><p>  Over 500 submissions were received at public consultation from construction industry stakeholders, individual practitioners and members of the public.  Due to the large volume of information received, and given that it is almost two years since the consultation process took place and the necessary regulations have since been finalised and have come into operation on 1 March 2014, publication of the submissions at this stage would appear to serve little useful purpose.  I will, however, arrange to have a list of the submissions received placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members. </p><p>  The new regulations will greatly strengthen the arrangements currently in place for the control of building activity by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  While attention in relation to defective buildings has focused predominantly on residential property, concerns in relation to building quality are not confined to the residential sector.  The obligation to demonstrate that a building has been designed and constructed in accordance with the Building Regulations applies to owners, builders and designers of buildings generally and this is entirely appropriate.   </p><p>  Given that the requirement to build in accordance with the Building Regulations has already existed in law under the Building Control Act 1990, the new regulations should not have any direct effect on the cost of employing a tradesperson. </p><p>  Meetings and discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and relevant agencies under the remit of that Department in relation to the implications of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 with particular reference to Foreign Direct investment.  Documentation lodged with local authorities for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulations is subject to the Freedom of Information Acts but that legislation provides exemptions and protections in relation to commercially sensitive information. </p><p>  My Department does not maintain statistical returns in relation to self-build projects.  Widespread concerns that the new regulations will put an end to self building or building by direct labour are unfounded.  A number of cases have, however, been brought to my attention whereby consumers have been quoted exorbitant charges for professional services in relation to residential construction projects.  The new regulations support improved competence and professionalism which will provide additional work opportunities for competent practitioners and construction professionals.  However, the consumer should not have to pay a premium for such services and if concerns about value for money for consumers prove to be well-founded, I will consider any reasonable and appropriate steps that may be required to address the issue.         </p><p>  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has indicated to my Department that the example cited of 190 hours work for an Assigned Certifier on a domestic project is not based on any official communication or guidance given by the Institute to its members. </p><p>  Overall, some 240 commencement notices have been lodged on the online Building Control Management System since the new regulations came into effect on 1 March 2014.  This suggests that the market is responding well to the new regulatory environment and that disruptive effect on construction activity will be minimal.   </p></reply>

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the Building Regulations. </p><p>  The new regulatory approach was preceded by a review by a high level working group, which included representatives of my Department and of local government (nominated by the County and City Managers Association), which reviewed the building control regulatory framework.  This review process was informed by awareness of developments in relation to building control generally in other jurisdictions, including in England and Wales. </p><p>  In broad terms the building control system in operation in England and Wales can be characterised as a full approval based system whereby local authorities inspect and approve all buildings. Significantly it is understood that a decision to step back from full local authority approval in all cases was implemented in 2005 and since that time the England and Wales systems allow for approval by independent professionals.  The cost of full approval by a local authority and the need to optimise the use of Government resources were understood to be key considerations in this change. </p><p>  A move to a full local authority approval system (even one which allowed for the involvement of private sector operators) along the lines of the England and Wales model or otherwise would involve significant increase in building control staffing and resourcing and would be difficult to contemplate in the present economic environment. </p><p>  The legal obligation on owners, builders and designers to design and construct in accordance with the Building Regulations would continue to apply.  The requirement to demonstrate compliance for approval purposes, whether by a building control authority or an approved independent operator, would mean that the person who owns or commissions the work would necessarily incur the requisite design, building and inspection/certification costs, over and above the administrative charge required to cover the approval fee payable to the local building control authority or approved operator.          </p></reply>

The OPR, which will be established with an independent corporate identity, will have three core functions.  It will carry out independent appraisal of regional and local level statutory plans prepared and adopted under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, including development plans, local area plans and regional planning guidelines.  The Planning Regulator will advise the Minister on the content of the plans, and, where appropriate, provide advice that all or part of a plan should be amended or rejected (through a ministerial direction).  The advice of the OPR will be published.  The OPR will also have investigative powers to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, possible systemic failings in the planning system, again taking account of the recommendation of the Mahon Tribunal in this regard.  The OPR will also be mandated to carry out the research, training and education roles identified by the Mahon Tribunal.   </p><p>  My Department is presently preparing a General Scheme of a new Planning and Development Bill giving consideration to the detailed issues to be addressed with regard to the establishment of the OPR, including those raised in the question.

The Panel recommended the development of a mandatory certification system which would recognise the importance of inspections, product certifications and site supervision taking proper account of the risk associated with design, materials and construction. The Panel also recommended that the system of independent inspections, carried out by building control officers, should be strengthened to complement the mandatory certification process   </p><p>  The Building Control Amendment Regulations 2014 now require   greater accountability for compliance with the Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.   I am satisfied that these measures are appropriate and will ensure a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry thereby ensuring that homeowners and construction clients can rely on getting the high quality homes and buildings they expect and deserve. </p><p>  A new online Building Control Management System (BCMS) which has been developed by local authorities came into operation on 1 March 2014 in line with the commencement of the new Regulations.   The system will provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector; it will facilitate the risk analysis of all projects for which commencement notices are received which   will inform each building control authority's own inspection arrangements thus ensuring that available inspection resources are used to optimum effect.   </p><p>  The enhanced professionalism and accountability arising from the arrangements under the new Regulations will lead to improved quality and reduce risk within the construction sector. This will in turn lead to market conditions more conducive to insurers and a wider availability and use of latent defects insurance. However, I have undertaken to explore the potential for latent defects insurance on construction projects as part of the wider reform of building control arrangements.   </p></reply>

The current Regulations are the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Insofar as the management of asbestos as a waste is concerned, the Waste Management Acts 1996-2013 prohibit any person from holding, transporting, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution, defined in section 5 of the 1996 Act to include action which would to a significant extent endanger human health.</p><p>  It is recommended that expert advice should be sought in dealing with asbestos materials and if removal is necessary it should only be done by a competent contractor with the required training.</p></reply>

This Strategy, which outlines a work programme to the end of 2016, does not propose that training for airline staff in the identification of human trafficking be made mandatory.  Focus in the Strategy, is on broader training and awareness raising with front-line staff such as police officers, border guards, immigration and asylum officials, public prosecutors, housing, labour, health, social and safety inspectors, civil society organisations, trade unions and employers organisations among others. </p><p>  Training for airline and other staff in the transport sector is, I believe, of benefit in the detection of human trafficking.  In 2012 the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department, in consultation with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, developed a training resource for airline staff and this is available on the my Department's dedicated anti-human trafficking website <b>www.blueblindfold.gov.ie</b>.  Since that time, joint communications by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities have been made with airlines flying into and out of both jurisdictions seeking their support to help in the fight against human trafficking by providing training to airline staff on the indicators of human trafficking. </p><p>  The EU Strategy will be the subject of evaluation and renewal in the coming years and the issue of training for staff such as those in the airline industry, whether on a mandatory or voluntary basis, will likely be considered in that context.</p></reply>

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of Garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the Western Region into the Belmullet District. </p><p>  It is deeply regrettable that so much Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location. However, this is absolutely necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom, as I have said previously, are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. Such action cannot be tolerated. The aim of the policing measures currently in place is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that from 2011 to 2013, 38 defendants were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on Garda&iacute;. The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16m. This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have performed duties at the Corrib Gas Project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.</p><p>  While the Garda role in policing the Corrib protests has given rise to a number of complaints being made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, it should be borne in mind that the majority of these were either found to be inadmissible or not to disclose wrongdoing on the part of the members of the force complained about.  Given these circumstances I do not see a necessity for an independent inquiry into the policing operation in north County Mayo.</p></reply>

The position remains the same.<blockquote><i></i>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that during their training, all Student/Probationer Garda&iacute; received instruction on the issue of suicide.  Historically, instruction was given to Student Garda&iacute; which included an overview of suicide, suicide statistics, parasuicide, deliberate self harm, bullying, prisoners etc.  This instruction was given to prepare Student Gardai for dealing with such occurrences on other phases of their training.  The new training programme in which new recruits will be taking part, includes a two day internationally recognised ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) suicide prevention programme which will be co-delivered with the Health Service Executive (HSE).  There are currently three staff members trained as ASIST trainers and the programme will be co-facilitated with HSE staff.  The ASIST programme is a suicide first aid programme which equips students with the skills required to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce the immediate risk of suicide.  In addition to the foregoing, there have been 35 Garda&iacute; trained in ASIST community workshops which have taken place in the Garda College since 2011, co-facilitated by HSE staff.  ASIST workshops also take place throughout the country with Divisional participation.</blockquote></p></reply>

This has necessitated the temporary redeployment of large numbers of Garda&iacute;, including specially trained personnel, from throughout the Western Region into the Belmullet District.   </p><p>  It is deeply regrettable that so much Garda resources have to be tied up in the policing of protest activity at this location. However, this is absolutely necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors, many of whom, as I have said previously, are not from the area and engage in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. Such action cannot be tolerated. The aim of the policing measures currently in place is to prevent public order offences and to ensure that people can go about their lawful business. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that from 2011 to 2013, 38 defendants were brought before the courts for public order offences, criminal damage and assault on Garda&iacute;. The total cost of policing these protests has now reached in excess of &euro;16m. This does not include the significant cost of the basic salaries of the members of An Garda Siochana who have performed duties at the Corrib Gas Project as these arise in the normal course.  Such expenditure comes at a time of economic difficulty for the State and when such resources could be put to far better use elsewhere.</p><p>  While the Garda role in policing the Corrib protests has given rise to a number of complaints being made to the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission, it should be borne in mind that the majority of these were either found to be inadmissible or not to disclose wrongdoing on the part of the members of the force complained about. Given these circumstances I do not see a necessity for an independent inquiry into the policing operation in north County Mayo.</p></reply>

The Bill, which is currently at an advanced stage of drafting, will promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes. </p><p>  The forthcoming Bill will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving the matter before embarking on such proceedings. It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of any such proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider the mediation option and suspend the proceedings to facilitate such a process.<b></b>  Mediation is, however, a voluntary process and I have no plans to make it mandatory in family law cases. As the Deputy is aware, I am strongly in favour of mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution, especially in the area of family law. Where the parties can reach agreement without recourse to the courts, it is generally better for them and in particular for any children they may have. Such agreed solutions can create better and more sustainable outcomes for the family concerned. </p><p>  It has to be recognised however that not all cases are suitable for mediation. It may not be appropriate, for example, where there are entrenched disputes or a serious imbalance in power between the parties.  It would be also be inappropriate to require the parties to engage in mediation in cases involving domestic violence. While I will continue to promote and support mediation and other forms of dispute resolution where feasible and appropriate, I do not intend to make it mandatory for family law cases. </p></reply>

The waiting times as of 1 March, 2014 are set out in the table below. Demand in 2013 was at the same level as it was in 2012 and while there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years. </p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. I know that waiting times are a matter of constant concern to the Board and that it keeps them under very active review. I am also aware that the Board is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board last year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled. </p><p>  In September 2013 I signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. The Regulations include a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and they also include increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the resources available to the Board.</p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p>  The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. Where the triage approach is operative there is a waiting time for the triage appointment and a waiting time for the second consultation. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p>  In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise.</p><p>  In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated. I know that the Board is working particularly hard on promoting mediation as a meaningful option.</p><p>  While the Board&rsquo;s asylum related legal services were previously funded from a separate grant, since 2012 I have funded the Board on the basis of a single &lsquo;grant-in-aid&rsquo;. With the drop in demand for asylum, the Board has taken steps to integrate the delivery of its asylum related services into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased.</p><p>  I am aware that the Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court. Cases in the District Court are often those that need the most immediate remedy.</p><p>  I am also aware that the Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice / legal area such as the Courts Service and the HSE (now the Child and Family Agency), with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.</p><p><b>Waiting times &ndash; 1 March, 2014</b><table><tr><th>Law Centre</th><th>Part-Time Centre</th><th>Waiting time for a first consultation<br /><br />[Weeks]</th><th>Further waiting time for a second consultation<br /><br />(centres operating triage)<br /><br />[Weeks]</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Athlone</td><td>24</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Athlone</td><td>Mullingar</td><td>24</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown</td><td> - </td><td>25</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Castlebar</td><td> - </td><td>17</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td> - </td><td>20</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Clondalkin</td><td> - </td><td>5</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td> - </td><td>40</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Cork South</td><td> - </td><td>64</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Dundalk</td><td> - </td><td>16</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Ennis</td><td> - </td><td>23</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas</td><td> - </td><td>30</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St</td><td> - </td><td>29</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House</td><td> - </td><td>12</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Gardiner Street</td><td> - </td><td>17</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td> Carlow</td><td>3</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td> Kilkenny</td><td>3</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Letterkenny</td><td> - </td><td>18</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td> - </td><td>44</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td> - </td><td>29</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>Drogheda</td><td>17</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td>Monaghan</td><td>22</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Montague Court</td><td> - </td><td>22</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td> - </td><td>17</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Nenagh</td><td> - </td><td>4</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge</td><td> - </td><td>8</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Unit</td><td> -</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td> - </td><td>48</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Boyle</td><td>5</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>Sligo</td><td>7</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Smithfield</td><td> - </td><td>44</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Tallaght</td><td> - </td><td>17</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Tralee</td><td>- </td><td>22</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore</td><td>- </td><td>17</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>-</td><td>24</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>-</td><td>47</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>- </td><td>13</td><td>n/a</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These crimes cause deep distress to householders and have a broader impact in terms of fear of crime in the community.</p><p>  Garda Operation Fiacla remains in force nationally and specific burglary initiatives continue to be implemented in each Garda Region to target suspected offenders. Operation Fiacla has proven to be a robust and effective response to burglary offences and this is borne out by the latest crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office which show that the rate of burglary has decreased by 7.2% nationally for twelve months ending 31 December 2013.  Garda actions to counteract burglary under Operation Fiacla have led to the arrest of 8,344 persons with 4,755 persons being charged as of 28 February 2014 and this underlines the impact being made by Garda&iacute; under the operation.  </p><p>  Insofar as the area referred to the Deputy is concerned, as part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Aimsir is in force throughout the Western Region, including Edgeworthstown.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led policing and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders. These arrangements are kept under review and local Garda management closely monitor all trends in the incidence of burglary, with adjustments being made on an ongoing basis to maintain the effective focus of the operation.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of all personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources. </p><p>  However, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Roscommon/Longford Division on 31 January 2014, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 286. There is also 20 Garda Reserves and 24 Civilians attached to the Roscommon/Longford Division.</p><p>  The needs of the Roscommon/Longford Division will be fully considered in the next allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; by the Garda Commissioner.  It is envisaged that the first batch of new recruits will enter the training college in Templemore later this year and that they will be attested and assigned to Garda stations in early 2015.</p></reply>

The decision of the issuing person cannot be fettered in any way and I have no role in the matter.<br /><br />  However, applicants, who have been refused and are dissatisfied with the decision of an issuing person, have recourse to appeal that decision to the District Court, in accordance with the provisions of section 15A of the Firearms Act 1925, as inserted by section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</blockquote></p></reply>

All reports submitted under section 80 are laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after their receipt in accordance with section 80(6) of the Garda Act 2005.</p><p>  Section 106 of the Garda Act provides that, for the purpose of preventing complaints arising or of reducing the number of complaints, I as Minister may request the Ombudsman Commission to examine a practice, policy or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This request may be made on my own initiative or following a recommendation by the Ombudsman Commission.  To date, only one section 106 report has been completed by GSOC, this was in relation to the Garda fixed charge processing scheme and the report was submitted in 2009. I published this report on my Department's website last week.</p><p>  Section 103 of the Garda Act 2005 requires GSOC to provide information to certain parties to keep them informed of the progress and results of investigations.  In cases where an investigation resulted from a complaint, these parties include the complainant, the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose conduct is the subject of a complaint and the Garda Commissioner.  It does not include the Minister although there is provision for &quot;any other person that the Commission considers has a sufficient interest in the matter&quot;.  Where the investigation arises from a referral from the Garda Commissioner (s.102(1)), a decision by the Ombudsman Commission that an investigation is desirable in the public interest (s.102(4)), or a referral by the Minister (s.102 (5)), the Act provides that the Minister is one of the parties to be kept informed of the progress and results of investigations.  </p><p>  With regard to the receipt of GSOC reports of investigations, all reports received from GSOC are initially assessed by officials of my Department who will consider whether any additional action is required. This would include considering whether there are issues in the report which should be brought to my specific attention or to the attention of another area of the Department or other relevant body.</p><p>  Records are not maintained in a manner that would enable me to readily provide the Deputy with a detailed breakdown of such reports received. As an indication of the number of such reports, the GSOC annual reports show they received 72 referrals in 2012 from the Garda Commissioner under s.102(1), with 90 in 2011 and 103 in 2010. </p></reply>

Even though the Commissioners letter of 10 March had referred to the systemic issue, I am also informed that there was little discussion of that particular issue and certainly not in any red flag manner. It may be the case that the explosive nature of the recordings in the context of the high profile Bailey case deflected the attention of those present at the meeting from the systemic issue. I understand that from the 10 March onwards, the matters covered in the Commissioners letter were being considered by officials in the Department of Justice in the context of the ongoing legal consultation in relation to the specific case in question. It should be also noted that the following day, 12 March I published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate Report into the Fixed Charged Processing System. On the morning of 12 March I was taking Committee Stage of the DNA data Bill. I was scheduled at 1:30pm to attend a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers and at 2:15pm to attend the Cabinet meeting. After the Cabinet meeting the Garda Inspectorate report together with an accompanying statement was issued and at 6pm that evening I was scheduled to launch a book on divorce law at the Distillery Building. I was present at the book launch until 8pm that evening. The day after that, 13 March the Secretary General was appearing at the Public Accounts Committee, I was in the Department of Defence on 14 March and left for Mexico on 15 March to fulfil my Government duties for St Patrick's Day. I understand that subsequently, on 19 and 20 March 2014 Garda Headquarters copied the Department with correspondence between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and both the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Data Protection Commissioner and further legal correspondence was received in the Department on 24 March. Due to a family bereavement the Secretary General was away from the Office from Saturday 15 March and did not return to work until Monday 24 March. The Secretary General briefed me on the matter on Monday evening. Subsequently, I and then the Secretary General, was called over to the Office of An Taoiseach to discuss the matters at hand.</p><p>  As I have indicated I received a copy of the letter of 10 March at 12:40 the following day. It was not until receipt of the letter that I learned of the various meetings detailed above taking place and of the background circumstances to my not being fully informed of these matters earlier nor receiving the letter of the 10 March 2014 shortly after its receipt in the Department. </p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.    The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- </p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. </p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association's claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks. </p></reply>

This was to avoid possible logistical difficulties that may have arisen at the airport of arrival in the US, which had some restrictions in terms of its customs facilities. A similar requirement has not arisen since then. I have been informed by the Air Corps that normal immigration and customs procedures were carried out in the terminal building and that the aircraft was not boarded.

The Act provides for increased penalties for offences, with fines of up to &euro;5,000 on summary conviction and &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years on indictment.

Properties located in the Fishery Harbour Centres are, when appropriate, offered for tenancy under lease by means of open competitive tendering process following public procurement guidelines. </p><p>  My Department has been in correspondence on this matter. In 2003, the persons concerned were successful in such a public tendering process for a property in Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre. The lease, signed voluntarily by the individuals in 2003, is a formal legally binding document on both parties, and the terms of the lease would have been made available prior to the tendering process.</p><p>  As in other leasing arrangements, this lease sets out how future rents will be determined and in this case a rent review was to be conducted every five years.  A rent review was scheduled and conducted for May 2008.  The outcome of the review was disputed by the tenants and, as allowed for under the lease, a rent review dispute procedure, which is binding on both parties, was initiated.   An independent expert agreed by both parties recommended a decrease in the original revised valuation.  This rent as determined by the independent expert is the rent currently being charged for the property. </p><p>  From an overall perspective, I am acutely aware of the economic situation facing businesses and small enterprises and following the completion of rent reviews due up to mid 2008 I decided that no rent reviews would be carried out for subsequent years and that zero rent increases would be applied across the board. This approach was applied in the case of the rent review that was due on this property in May, 2013. </p></reply>

As such it is not open to me to intervene in individual cases.  The Republic of India has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, as such it is not necessary to have a bilateral agreement with India.  As a contracting state under the Hague Convention, the Adoption Act 2010 provides that adoptions by Irish prospective adoptive parents may be made subject to Irish and Indian requirements being satisfied  in line with relevant laws and the provisions of the Hague Convention.  It is a matter for contacting states whether they wish to impose restrictions on whether and how intercountry adoptions of citizens of that State may be effected.</p><p>  I recently facilitated a meeting between the Irish India Support Group and the Adoption Authority in order to provide prospective adopters up to date information on the status of adoptions from India.  At this meeting the Adoption Authority advised that there remains a general moratorium by the Indian Central Authority (CARA) on India accepting adoption applications from other countries other than in special circumstances.  The Authority has recently received an announcement from CARA that India is currently accepting packs from non-resident Indian prospective adoptive parents for the adoption of Indian children (&ldquo;normal&rdquo; category).  This means that India remains closed to non-Indian prospective adoptive parents at this time in respect of what it terms  &ldquo;normal&rdquo; categories of children.  The Adoption Authority understands that CARA is accepting applications in respect of children which are termed &quot;special needs&quot;, which includes children over five years of age and sibling groups.  The Authority is currently attempting to establish from CARA a possible time frame for the acceptance of application packs in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; category from non-Indian nationals.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority has advised it is their position that it is necessary to have an Irish registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoptions from India in order to safeguard the process for the child and the adoptive parents.  The Authority has recently decided to delegate its functions under Articles 15, 16 and 17 of the Hague Convention to Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency with regard to adoptions from India. Helping Hands is awaiting approval by CARA in order to proceed in this regard.  I have arranged a follow-up meeting with the Irish India Support Group and the Adoption Authority in May in order to update the group on progress made.</p></reply>

Because of the economic difficulties it has not been possible to provide any substantial capital funding to support developments in the child care sector since 2009.  I did secure capital funding totalling &euro;6m in Budget 2012 to provide for the refurbishment of services in which substantial Government capital and support funding had already been invested.  I was also successful in securing &euro;2.75m in capital funding in Budget 2013 to support the ongoing improvement of established child care services participating in one or more of the child care support programmes implemented by my Department.

Special schools provide for those children with the most complex special educational needs who require specialised educational provision beyond that which can normally be provided for them in mainstream education. These schools are mainly attached to non-statutory disability service providers which are funded by the HSE.  These services have been developed by individual local providers and reflect their experience and expertise.  Special schools have support staff, including in some cases nurses, in place.  Nurses in special schools would provide support to a small number of children who require high levels of support.  The nurse's role, may include guidance in relation to the role carried out by Special Needs Assistants, which come under the Department of Education and Skills, in the area of care support.</p><p>  Professional accountability of nursing staff and their adherence to proper and standardised clinical procedures in special schools is relevant in this overall context.  It should be noted that all nurses are legally required to be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and are accountable to the public though the Board.  They must adhere to a Code of Professional Conduct and a Scope of Practice guidance document.  The Scope of Practice sets out the range of roles, functions, responsibilities and activities which a registered nurse or registered midwife is educated, competent and has the authority to perform.  This is the case for all nurses, regardless of their employment setting, from a hospital to a special-school.</p><p>  The National Council for Special Education, in policy advice to the Minister for Education and Skills last year recommended a more consistent approach to accessing nursing support, for children with high medical needs in special schools through dedicated health service funding.  This recommendation raises very complex and significant issues for the Health and Education sectors.  The stakeholders involved including the HSE, the Departments of Education and Skills and Health, will need to examine this issue fully, including the financial and employment resource and overall policy implications involved.</p></reply>

This process provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is taking a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.</p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into integrated multidisciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  This involves the roll-out of a new model of service, the objective of which is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2014 with an additional &euro;4m allocated to assist in its implementation.  My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detailed operational issues that he has raised.</p></reply>

Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market the manufacturer has to seek an authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements.</p><p>  My Department has been informed by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) that it is in receipt of a market authorisation request from a manufacturer under the EU Mutual Recognition Procedure for a medicinal product containing Cannabis extract. This product is indicated for the relief of symptoms of spasticity for people with multiple sclerosis.  Draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are being prepared to enable authorised cannabis-based medicinal products such as Sativex to be legally prescribed by medical practitioners and used by patients.  It is anticipated that the draft Regulations will be introduced in mid-2014.</p></reply>

The service provided dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.  The EAS completed 368 missions in 2013, one third of which involved STEMI-type heart attack patients, who need time-critical transfers to primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention units for treatment.</p><p>  An evaluation of the pilot found a clinical need for the service and that it should be established on a permanent basis.  I accepted the review's findings and an inter-service working group is currently examining how best to implement the report's recommendations.  In the interim, with the agreement of the Minister for Defence, aeromedical support by the Air Corps to the EAS will continue until June 2014, pending finalisation of the deliberations of the working group.</p></reply>

Since the beginning of the year the Regional Directors of Performance and Integration (RDPI's), with support from Regional HR, have been working with each Agency to verify where there are deviations from pay policy and to assist the Agencies to become compliant with health sector pay policy.</p><p>  In line with the pay policy, organisations which wished to continue payment of an unapproved allowance were invited to submit their business cases for consideration by the HSE.  Business cases were also required for the continued payment of allowances which are not encompassed by or in line with the Department of Health Consolidated Salary Scales but may have been sanctioned in the past.  A total of 202 business cases have now been received.  Where the HSE is satisfied that there are legitimate reasons for the continuation of an allowance, these will be submitted to the Department of Health for sanction.  The Department of Health will liaise as appropriate with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  An Internal Review Panel, made up of  members of the HSE Leadership Team, have reviewed each business case in detail and a report on their deliberations is expected shortly. 143 business cases were received in respect of Senior Managers, i.e. those at a salary level of Grade VIII and above, for consideration by the Internal Review Panel.  In addition, 59 business cases in respect of employees on a salary level below Grade VIII have been reviewed by the Regional Directors of Performance and Integration with support from Regional HR.</p><p>  As indicated above the Internal Review Panel process in the HSE is nearing completion.  The Department expects to receive a report on the outcome of the Review Panel's conclusions shortly and will then consider any business cases that the Review Panel consider may be justified, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Due to the complexity of the issues involved, it is difficult to give a precise timescale as to when this issue will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, however, I am determined that the payment of unapproved allowances to senior executives will be eliminated in an expeditious manner.</p><p>  Employees of Section 39 organisations are not public servants.  They are not included in the HSE employment control ceiling, are not bound by the Department of Health Consolidated Salary Scales and are not members of a public service pension scheme.  The Government, however is determined to ensure that public pay policy is respected across the health service and to that end, at my request, the Director General of the HSE has written to 353 Section 39 funded agencies in receipt of HSE funding of more than &euro;250,000, requesting that they have due regard to public pay policy particularly in respect of senior managers.</p></reply>

The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides some emergency capacity in the greater Dublin area, as well as non-emergency patient transport.</p><p>  The ongoing development of pre-hospital emergency care involves a range of initiatives, including the development of a single national control and dispatch system for the State. This new system, which is expected to be completed in 2015, will deploy all emergency ambulance resources in the State, including emergency ambulances, rapid response and intermediate care vehicles, first responders, aeromedical services and ambulances in Dublin.</p><p>  In the context of the development of the national control system, the Dublin City Manager and the HSE's Chief Operating Officer have commissioned a joint review of DFB ambulance services in Dublin City and County.  The review will consider all aspects of ambulance operations provided by DFB within the Dublin area, including the capacity and capability of ambulance services.</p><p>  The review will inform consideration of the best model for provision of emergency medical services in the greater Dublin area.  It is part of the process of ensuring a clinically driven, nationally co-ordinated system, supported by improved technology, so that emergency pre-hospital care can continue to modernise and services can be delivered in an appropriate and timely manner, to the benefit of patients.</p><p>  There has been speculation about this review and I am aware of the concerns expressed by some about the future of the service.  I want to assure those concerned that I appreciate the service the Fire Brigade provides.  This review is not a negative reflection on that service.  It is being conducted in parallel with the HIQA review of the National Ambulance Service and the NAS capacity review.  The intention behind all of these reviews is to examine our pre-hospital emergency care services throughout the country, with a view to identifying the best way to enable them to meet the challenges of the future.  I look forward to the recommendations of all three reviews, which I am certain will enable us to ensure that we provide a service capable of delivering the best possible outcomes for the public.</p></reply>

The NTPF negotiates with each nursing home proprietor on an individual basis and under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process.</p><p>  The NTPF assesses nursing homes under four criteria:</p><p>  - costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>  - price(s) previously charged;</p><p>  - local market price; and</p><p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>  Under the NHSS services and supports which are common to the vast majority of nursing home residents are included in the cost of care.

For the avoidance of doubt and for the purpose of demonstrating that it has met this condition, the Proprietor agrees to make clear in its contract with the Resident the full extent of the services that are included in the price agreed with the NTPF under the Scheme.&quot;</p><p>  The NTPF have confirmed that it refutes absolutely any suggestion that it endorsed reductions in price for long term care being passed directly or indirectly onto residents in the form of extra charges (as opposed to proprietors reducing profit levels or introducing cost efficiencies).</p><p>  It has also confirmed that if similar such allegations are made, or similar price negotiating tactics used, by nursing home proprietors they will be robustly challenged and defended by the NTPF.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is, therefore, determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. </p><p>  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis.  Persons who have been granted a medical card under the financial hardship provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details. This is necessary so that the HSE can make a correct determination of continuing eligibility. Where an applicant indicates on a review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard. The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other information material to a review assessment. There are no proposals to change these processes.</p></reply>

Towards this end, funding of &euro;90 million and some 1,100 posts have been provided since 2012 to develop our community mental health services and suicide prevention resources.  The budget for specialist mental health services in 2014 is approximately &euro;766 million which represents approximately 6.2% of the overall frontline health service budget.  Approximately 90% of mental health problems are dealt with in primary care and some 30% of people who attend primary care have a mental health problem.  Expenditure on these services is not captured in the mental health budget.</p><p><i>  A Vision for Change </i>indicates a requirement for 10,647 WTE staff which when adjusted for the 2011 population census is 12,240 WTE staff by 2016.  However, given the changed economic circumstances since the publication of <i>Vision</i> in 2006, the Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.  The HSE Mental Health Division, in its Service Plan for 2014 commits to the development of an initial workforce plan for 2014 to bring greater certainty around essential replacements and the streamlining of recruitment to allow for more local control and specialisation where appropriate.</p><p>  While staffing levels in the mental health service have fallen there are positives that must be acknowledged.  Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user recovery focused, modern, community-based service model for mental health.  The overall reduction in numbers has been mitigated due to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments in 2012, 2013 and again in 2014 which has allowed the HSE to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in <i>A Vision for Change</i> i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>  Recruitment of the additional posts 890 posts approved in 2012 and 2013 is continuing with 95% of the 2012 posts filled as at the end of January 2014 and the recruitment process complete for 51% of the 2013 posts, with a further 20% in the final stages in the recruitment process.  These posts continue to come on stream and are targeted to be in place by the end of Quarter 2 of 2014.  Decisions on the breakdown of the new 2014 posts (between 250 - 280 posts) will be made following a business case and analysis process which is currently being undertaken in the HSE.  This will ensure that the required professional grades are recruited to fill identified service gaps.  Active recruitment for these posts will commence in the second Quarter of 2014, with all targeted to be in place by the end of the year.</p></reply>

This process provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  </p><p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is taking a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  </p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into integrated multidisciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  This involves the roll-out of a new model of service, the objective of which is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2014 with an additional &euro;4m allocated to assist in its implementation.  </p><p>  My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detailed operational issues that he has raised</p></reply>

The HSE receives applications for the inclusion of  medicinal products in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The applications are considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. </p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) uses two different types of pharmacoeconomic evaluation - rapid review process and full pharmacoeconomic evaluation. The rapid review process is used to try to identify or triage out any medicines which do not require a full evaluation. The rapid review process typically takes between 2 and 4 weeks. In 2013, 43 rapid reviews were completed and 51% of those resulted in positive recommendations typically within 2-4 weeks.</p><p>  A full pharmacoeconomic evaluation is reserved in general for those medicines which are of high cost or have significant budget impact and which have not been approved via the rapid review process. The process used involves the pharmaceutical company in question submitting a detailed clinical and economic dossier to support the price it has chosen to seek. There is wide variation in the time taken by companies  to submit these dossiers, in the amount of detail provided in initial dossiers and in the extent to which the initial dossier address relevant concerns. There is frequently a significant amount of clarification which the NCPE must require from companies. When the NCPE requests that data the clock is stopped on the assessment until the company provides that necessary data. The NCPE completes all phamaco-economic evaluations within the 180 day timeline set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The Act allows for stop clocks where companies are required to provide additional data. In 2013 the NCPE completed 11 full pharmacoeconomic evaluations. The average length of time taken was 67 days.</p><p>  The pharmacoeconomic evaluation process is an important input into the decision making process around new medicines. </p></reply>

In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of healthcare delivery. A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and the recipients of blood and blood products. </p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] from donating blood is not based on sexuality or orientation but on the fact that there are increased levels of HIV infection among men who have sex with men in Ireland.</p><p>  Decisions of the IBTS on such matters are based on available evidence. Data available in Ireland from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, as well as from international sources, is kept under review.  The most recent full year data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is in respect of 2012 and in that year 341 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in Ireland.  The highest proportion of new diagnoses, 166 (nearly 49%), was in MSM and this proportion has been increasing since 2004.   Full year results for 2013 are not yet available but the data for the first two quarters of that year show rates similar to 2012.   These rates of HIV infection in MSM are disproportionately high, considering that MSM account for a relatively small proportion of the population.  </p><p>  The IBTS keeps its eligibility criteria for donating under regular on-going review, working closely with blood services internationally.</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.   The assessment for a medical card is, therefore, determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. </p><p>  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. </p><p>  All medical card and GP visit card holders, irrespective of the basis on which the card was awarded, are subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility.  Persons who have been granted a medical card under the financial hardship provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details. This is necessary so that the HSE can make a correct determination of continuing eligibility. Where an applicant indicates on a review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard. The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other information material to a review assessment. There are no proposals to change these processes.</p></reply>

While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role.  Autism is described as a spectrum disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD) that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe.  Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity. </p><p>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for ASD it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention.  The Health Service Executive does not currently collect information specifically on adults and children identified with Autism on a national basis on the basis of diagnosis. Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of autism or any other disability.  The 2011 National Council for Special Education (NCSE) study on prevalence of special educational needs in Ireland (A Study on the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs, Joanne Banks and Selina McCoy, Economic and Social Research Institute) includes autism and estimates that prevalence for ASD is 1 in 100.  This is in line with the figure of .9% reported by the Centre for Disease Control in the US. </p><p>  Research was initiated in 2004 into autism under the auspices of the HRB as part of the Autism Genome Project - a collaboration of autism researchers internationally aimed at understanding susceptibility to ASD.  The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families. Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism. In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis.  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants.  These gene variants were both de novo (arising for the first time in individuals) or inherited, implicating many novel ASD genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment. </p><p>  In relation to ongoing research, I understand that an Autism Research Group in Trinity College Dublin is focusing on understanding the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of autism using genetic and neuroimaging methodologies.  The Group is funded through a variety of funding agencies and collaborates widely nationally and internationally. </p></reply>

The current pharmacy based model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including low population centres in rural areas.  It enables pharmacies to receive deliveries each day from multiple wholesalers ensuring that all patients have continued access to essential medicines without delay.  Under this model, as the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacies with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of  central procurement arrangement envisaged by the Deputy. </p><p>  Establishing an alternative centralised distribution centre capable of distributing 70 million items across the State would be extremely difficult to achieve and would absorb any potential savings available to the HSE from directly purchasing medicines. </p><p>  Under the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika, Ireland committed to increasing the share of generic drug usage in the medium-term.  In Quarter 4 2013 generic products accounted for 58% of the total off-patent market by volume.  My Department has set a target of achieving 70% generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume by 2016.</p><p>  A number of enabling measures are being implemented to achieve this target, in particular, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  </p><p>  In October 2012 a  new agreement on the pricing and supply of generic drugs was reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the maximum price the HSE pays for generic products is 50% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  Recent negotiations with the APMI have resulted in agreement on additional price reductions and, from 1 May 2014, the maximum price the HSE will pay will be 40% of the initial price of an originator medicine.  This will result in the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increasing from 5% currently to approximately 20%. </p><p>  The Medicines Management Programme within the HSE has introduced the preferred drugs initiative which facilitates more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines.  It continues to engage with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.</p></reply>

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs. </p><p>  The prevalence of MRSA has dropped considerably in recent years.  There has been a decrease of 62.5% in reported cases of MRSA from 2006 to 2013.  However, there are concerns about the rates of resistance of other organisms as detailed in the EARS- Net Report referred to below. </p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA,<i>Clostridium difficile </i>etc.   The most recent European Antimicrobial Surveillance System Report (EARS - Net) for Quarter 4, 2013 was published on March 27th.   The full Report is available at .</p><p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in the control and prevention of HCAIs for many years, including:</p><p>o SARI 2001-2010 (The Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland)  which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001.</p><p>o HSE ' Say No to Infection' which focused on both HCAIs and AMR, launched in 2007</p><p>o The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.</p><p>o Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals: </p><p>- HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012</p><p><i>- S. aureus </i>  bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital</p><p>- Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007)</p><p>- Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)</p><p>  The overall aim of the National Clinical Programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance.  Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients, these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e., IV lines/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients/residents/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented. </p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland, MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland. </p><p>In December last I launched and endorsed the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>  (MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes/long stay residential units and the community.  </p><p>  I might add that I have ensured that Patient Safety has been made a priority within the HSE's Annual Service Plan through specific measures focused on quality and patient safety including HCAIs, Medication safety and implementation of Early Warning Score systems.  My officials meet the HSE each month on the Service Plan and patient safety is a standing item on that agenda.</p></reply>

The Group is now focusing on career structures and pathways following training and is due to report by the end of March on these issues.

The planned establishment of hospital groups should help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital.  Where posts are vacant and suitable candidates cannot be sourced, locums are retained or alternative arrangements are made to ensure service delivery.</p></reply>

My Department and the Health Insurance Authority monitor the factors that contribute to costs on an ongoing basis. </p><p>  The health insurance market is challenged by factors such as an ageing population, a reduction in numbers holding private health insurance and constant pressures on claims costs.  However, I am determined to address these issues and to promote a sustainable private health insurance market as we move to UHI.</p><p>  I appointed an independent chair to work with health insurers, the HIA and my own Department, to identify effective strategies for costs management.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin's first report, published at the end of December, made a number of important recommendations now being pursued by insurers, the HSE and my Department.  These recommendations include measures to control costs, greatly improve clinical audit, streamline claims processing and address fraud, waste and abuse in the industry. </p><p>  As recommended by Mr. McLoughlin, I am also looking favourably at the scope for introducing Lifetime Community Rating and at other measures to encourage younger people to buy health insurance.  Work on  Phase II of Mr. McLoughlin's report, which will deal further with the factors driving costs in health insurance, is progressing well and will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down the cost of private health insurance in the transition to Universal Health Insurance.  </p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family qualify for a medical card.  The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her dependants.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines.</p><p>  However, once an application for a medical card incorporates certification from a medical consultant or a general practitioner that the applicant has a medical condition which is categorised as terminal, and the applicant is nearing the end stage of life, the applicant will be granted eligibility to a medical card, without being subjected to a means assessment.  Medical cards issued, in such circumstances, will have a default eligibility period of 6 months, from the month of issue.  Mindful that no definitive prognosis can be provided on the life expectancy of a terminally ill person, the HSE takes a sensitive approach on the review of medical card eligibility, beyond the initial six month period.  A Medical Card Review notification is not issued and eligibility is extended to take account of the cardholder's on-going circumstances. </p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months and the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility at any point in time to confirm that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility.</p></reply>

Considerable progress has been made over the last 12 months on progressing compliance with the provisions of the Working Time Directive in respect of NCHDs.  Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and 51.4 hours in the third quarter of 2013. </p><p>  The HSE is focused on advancing implementation of the Directive.  Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieve EWTD compliance. The agreement focused in particular on steps to be taken in the period up to the NCHD rotation on 13 January 2014 to eliminate shifts in excess of 24 hours.  At a meeting between the HSE and the IMO on 6 February progress made by acute hospitals on achieving compliance with the agreed maximum 24 hour shift target was assessed.  That assessment showed that the majority of hospitals have made significant progress.</p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance.  Achievement of full compliance will also requires reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups.  The number of NCHDs in the public health system has increased by over 200 in recent years and now exceeds 4,900. However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties.  There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location.  </p><p>  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last summer.  The Group will make recommendations aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system, planning for future service needs and achieving the maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.  The Group provided an Interim Report in December 2013 focusing on training and is now examining career structures and pathways following training with a view to submitting a report by the end of this week.  It will provide the final report by the end of June 2014.</p></reply>

However, this review has been brought forward as a consequence of a recent High Court Judgement on the DART Underground Railway Order which ruled that the period for serving Notices to Treat for the purpose of compulsory purchase of property under the Order should be 18 months rather than the seven years set out in the Railway Order.  This  means that a decision on whether  to proceed with DART Underground under the current Railway Order must be made by September 2015.</p><p>   As a consequence I have asked the National Transport Authority (NTA) to update the business case for the project and to review funding options.  I expect to have a report from the NTA by late summer and will consider the options for the project over the following months having regard to the outcome of the review, its affordability, other competing priorities and the Government position on funding for infrastructure  post 2016.  </p><p>   I am also referring the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply as I understand that as part of its overall research and planning for public transport in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) it has reviewed the option of electrification from Malahide to Balbriggan as a stand-alone project.  The Deputy should advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within ten working days. </p></reply>

At present, most schools require trainees to pay in quarterly or monthly instalments rather than 'up front' as was the case in Waterford.</p><p>   </p></reply>

My Department is responsible for administering payment of grants to all the mountain rescue teams in Ireland.  These teams, staffed by volunteers,  are called upon to operate in all weather conditions and provide a hugely important service.  The grant scheme is managed by the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) as Chair of the National Co-ordinating Committee for Mountain and Cave Rescue.  The IRCG similarly administers payments of grants to other rescue organisations such as the Community Rescue Boats of Ireland (CRBI) and the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation (ICRO).</p><p>  In administering this grant, the IRCG meets Mountain Rescue Ireland and relevant statutory bodies each year to review grant requests in accordance with a framework agreed some years ago.  Over the past five years this grant funding scheme has provided &euro;1,026,560 to Irish mountain rescue teams and management organisations.  <table><tr><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>269,682</td><td>247,654</td><td>177,065</td><td>164,258</td><td>167,901</td></tr></table></p></reply>

There is no one internationally accepted model of GDLS.  Instead, it consists of a number of components which can be selected according to which are most appropriate to the context of an individual country.  The Road Safety Authority published in September 2010 a list of nine components for a GDLS for Ireland.  This followed wide-ranging study and consultation.  The nine measures are being introduced on a phased basis.  Three of the nine measures were introduced before the present year, including for example compulsory lessons for learner drivers.  The recently passed Road Traffic Act 2014 includes three more - a minimum of logged driving experience before learners can take the test; a new category of novice driver, covering the first two years of full licence; and a lower disqualification level of seven penalty points for learners and novices.  The new provisions regarding novices will be commenced from 1 August 2014.  The legislation will not apply retrospectively.  The new provisions will therefore apply only to people who qualify after the date of commencement.</p></reply>

This was designed to generate additional air capacity and services to Ireland for the business and tourism sectors.  2013, the year of the Gathering, was the best year for inbound tourism since 2008.  I intend 2014 to be even better thanks to the Wild Atlantic way, better value for money and competitive and direct air access.  In line with the zero travel tax both Irish and foreign airlines announced 34 new routes/services at Irish airports for the 2014 season.  My focus as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is to encourage airlines and our airports to generate even more direct air services into Ireland in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Given the current financial position it has been necessary to reduce the grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.  The main focus has to be on the maintenance and repair of roads and this will remain the position in the coming years.  The small amount of funding available for major schemes will focus on projects already under construction or that this Department is already committed to.  I am aware of the traffic issues the Deputy describes.  However, the preliminary cost estimate given in the 2010 Feasibility Study Report for the Claregalway inner relief road was approximately &euro;21 million.  The Council was allocated &euro;50,000 towards the design of the B&aacute;ile Chl&aacute;ir Inner Relief Road in 2013.  However the reality is that my Department is not in a position to commit funding to the construction of a relief road for Claregalway at this stage. Any future consideration of a relief road would also take account of progress on the M17/18 project and its potential impact on traffic levels in Claregalway.</p></reply>
