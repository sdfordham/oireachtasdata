The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. </p><p>Child Benefit is currently paid to around 620,000 families in respect of some 1.19 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2016.  Child Benefit is an important source of income for all families and in Budget 2016 the Government increased Child Benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.</p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>-  qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>-  family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>-  the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-20a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042000055#WRA01400"><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 sets a comprehensive programme aimed at helping jobseekers to return to work.  Together with the national and regional Action Plans for Jobs, Enterprise 2015, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, the Further Education and Training Strategy,  the National Skills Strategy and the Review of Apprenticeships, it is designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce is equipped to respond flexibly to the demands of a growing economy and that unemployed jobseekers are positioned and supported to take up employment opportunities in the economy.</p><p>In framing and implementing these strategies the Government has consulted widely with stakeholders including employers, trade unions, and representatives of unemployed jobseekers.  In addition the State has a number of institutional arrangements in place that operate on an ongoing basis to inform the development and implementation of strategies.  In the case of the Pathways to Work strategy this includes the Labour Market Council, an independent group of industry leaders, advocates for unemployed jobseekers, trade unions and labour market experts.</p><p>The Department has also established a dedicated Employer Relations Division and Employer Engagement Teams in every Division who encourage, support and incentivise employers to recruit unemployed people on the Live Register.  As part of this role they work to match employer job specifications with people on the Live Register. To support this activity a new online system will be implemented later this year that will, among other things, enable employers to readily identify candidates who meet their skills requirements and enable the Department&rsquo;s case officers to further support jobseekers.  Data from the new system will provide real-time information on the skills and competencies being sought by employers and on any skills gaps.  This will be very useful to the relevant Government Departments and agencies seeking to address such gaps.</p><p>In a manner similar to the co-operation between the Department of Social Protection and the Labour Market Council, the planning and provision of education and training programmes by the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies is informed by the work of the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs which produces annual reports projecting the future skills needs of Irish industry. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection also works closely with the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards to ensure that the strategic reforms underway in the education and training sectors, such as the establishment of Regional Skills Fora, are informed by the skills and competencies profile of unemployed jobseekers.  </p><p>In this regard training programmes such as MOMENTUM are specifically designed to provide education and training to long term unemployed people to help them gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growth sectors.  It is delivered in partnership with both public and private education and training providers who have developed linkages with employers.  Participants receive training in areas with recognised skill shortages where existing vacancies have been identified. </p><p>The Department also collaborates with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to co-ordinate efforts to respond to the needs of employers and jobseekers.  A Steering Group of senior officials monitors implementation of a &ldquo;Protocol for Cooperation&rdquo; between the agencies.</p><p>As an example of the kind of close inter-agency partnership taking place to ensure that jobseekers are equipped with the skills necessary to meet industry needs, the Departments of Social Protection, Department of Education and Skills and Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are co-hosting an event focussed specifically on &ldquo;Effective Collaboration&rdquo; to take place on 17 May 2017.  The event will be attended by representatives from all relevant agencies who will hear best practice exemplars and discuss ways to improve effectiveness.</p></reply>

The incidence of certain contingencies can be difficult to predict and because of this, it is not possible to predict scheme demand over a five year period with accuracy.</p><p>For many schemes, it is difficult to project the change in recipients for each year over the next 5 years due to the potential impact of overall economic performance, labour market performance, customer circumstances and demographic changes.  Recipient number trends during 2015 and the first half of 2016 will be reviewed over the next few months, with the objective of finalising the forecast of recipient numbers for 2017.</p><p>The number of recipients on Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit is dependent upon economic performance, labour force performance, the availability and take-up of in-work supports and transfers to working age employment supports.  The 2016 REV Estimates includes a financial provision for jobseekers with an average Live Register of 305,250.  The 2016 Expenditure Report published at the time of the 2016 Budget in October 2016, assumed an average Live Register of 289,000 in 2017 and 273,000 in 2018.  These estimates are subject to review and change having regard to the performance of the labour market in the lead up to Budget 2017 later in the year.  At this stage, there is no Live Register forecast for the years 2019 to 2021.  Having regard to all of these factors, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on Jobseekers Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit for each year over the next five years.</p><p>The number of recipients on State Pension (Contributory) is dependent upon life expectancy, the contributions record of recipients and the age at which a state pension becomes payable.  Section 7 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act of 2011 provides for increasing the pension age to 67 in 2021.  At present, demographic factors are likely to see the number of people qualifying for State Pension (Contributory) increasing in the range 17,000 to 18,000 each year up to 2021.</p><p>The number of recipients on State Pension (Non-Contributory) is dependent upon the number of people of pension age not qualifying for State Pension (Contributory), and the means of such people.  At present, the numbers accessing this scheme are falling by a few hundred each year.</p><p>The number of recipients on Illness Benefit is dependent upon the numbers of people in employment, the increasing age profile of the labour force, the average duration of illness or injury and the continuing impact of previous budget measures.  Given the range of potential variables, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on Illness Benefit for each year over the next five years.</p><p>To qualify for Disability Allowance, a person must be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment, be aged between 16 and under 66, must satisfy a means test as well as a medical test and be habitually resident in the State.  The following table provides the average number of recipients each year on Disability Allowance over the last five years: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>Average Number of Recipients</td><td>100,280</td><td>101,550</td><td>103,100</td><td>108,800</td><td>115,030</td><td>119,270</td></tr></table></p><p>While numbers on Disability Allowance have risen significantly over the last three years, it is more difficult to quantify the rate of increase for each year over the next five years given the range of variables outlined above affecting the number of recipients.</p><p>The numbers of recipients on One Parent Family Payment is dependent upon the number of lone parents where their youngest child is within the qualifying age for One Parent Family Payment satisfying a means test, availability of in-work supports for parents and economic circumstances of recipients, including their participation in the labour force.  The number of recipients on Carers Allowance and Carers Benefit is dependent upon the availability of carers to care for people requiring care.  All claims are subject to a medical assessment to determine the level of care required, with Carers Allowance being subject to a means test and Carers Benefit being subject to a contribution condition test.  Given the range of potential variables, it is not possible to provide the number of weekly payments on these schemes for each year over the next five years.</p><p>Finally, the number of recipients claiming the Social Welfare Allowance Basic Payments scheme is mainly influenced by the number of people receiving interim payments while awaiting a decision on their primary scheme (for example, Disability Allowance or Jobseekers Allowance).  Given variations in the throughput of new claims arising from various contingencies outlined above across the Department&rsquo;s range of primary schemes, it is difficult to project trends for each year on this scheme over the next five years.</p></reply>

It also includes increasing the rates for Community Employment, Tus, Rural Social Scheme, Gateway, JobBridge and Job Initiative but it does not include increasing the top-ups paid on these schemes.  Furthermore, it includes increasing the average payment value of the Family Income Supplement in line with projected inflation.</p><p>In addition to the weekly social welfare payments, all social welfare payments includes monthly Child Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Household Benefits scheme payments, and the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.

The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; scheme of &euro;2.8 billion.    </p>  <p>  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four days in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working four or more days a week will not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  However, there is flexibility to look back as well as forward when considering whether a person is unemployed for four days in any period of 7 consecutive days.  This can mean that a casual worker may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment subject to the number of days they were unemployed in a previous week.      </p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  </p>  <p>  This is an important policy issue for the Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications for the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes.  In particular, increasing flexibility in the system could potentially, depending on the behavioural response, increase the number of people claiming a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment thereby increasing the total cost of the schemes to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

An Appeals Officer (AO), having fully considered all of the available evidence, disallowed the appeal. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified on the 25 September 2015 of the AO&rsquo;s decision and was provided at that time with an explanation of the basis for this decision.  Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of an AO is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed in the light of additional evidence or new facts.</p></reply>

It provides two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years - paid in monthly instalments provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person recruited was unemployed. </p>  <p>  JobsPlus is open to all eligible employers, including those employing childcare workers.  If a parent employs a person to provide childcare in the home, they can avail of the incentive if they are a registered employer and compliant with Irish tax and employment law. </p>  <p>  The employment offered to the childcare employee must be of a full-time nature of at least 30 hours per week spanning over four days per week.  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, employees are entitled to a minimum wage, currently &euro;9.15 per hour.  Employers recruiting under the JobsPlus incentive are required to comply with the Act and other statutory provisions in respect of pay and conditions. </p>  <p>  There are many benefits for employers and employees under the JobsPlus incentive.  Every new full-time job supported under JobsPlus not only reduces social welfare payments made by the State, but critically reduces the payments made to the longer term unemployed who are more likely to become long-term dependents of welfare.  The incentive also influences employers to consider longer-term unemployed jobseekers over those more recently unemployed or moving employment.  In addition, these new full-time workers will contribute to the Exchequer in terms of tax and PRSI paid. </p></reply>

At present the number of weekly customers attending the Falcarragh clinic has fallen to an average of 5 a week or less.  The fall in numbers is due to the far quicker turnaround on decisions on long term Social Welfare payments and also due to the administration of rental support being transferred to the Local Authority under the Housing Assistance Payment scheme. </p><p>The reduced numbers of clients who may continue to seek assistance at the Falcarragh clinic are being facilitated at the nearby weekly clinic in Dunfanaghy Intreo Office where the full range of DSP Services will also be available to customers.</p><p>If a person is unable to travel to the Dunfanaghy clinic, for example due to illness, a phone number has been provided for the customer to contact the CWS.  In such circumstances, a home visit by a Community Welfare Officer will be arranged if necessary.  Arrangements for emergency cases requiring the assistance of the CWS outside of normal working hours will also continue to remain in place in Falcarragh.

This included transferring CWS staff into case officer roles to meet activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme.  As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the CWS, generally available in one location.</p>  <p>  CWS clinics were generally operating from Health Service Executive (HSE) premises.  Where CWS service delivery has been structured these services are now being provided from Departmental offices.  Premises, furniture and other equipment that remained in the ownership of the HSE were retained by that Agency.  The staffing and office requirements for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed in the context of the ongoing development of integrated services, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department. </p>  <p>  A number of changes were made in January 2014 in relation to the delivery of CWS in the South Kildare/West Wicklow area including Clane.  Service had traditionally been provided as a walk-in-service in local clinics one or two mornings per week for limited hours.  From January 2014 the CWS in the South Kildare/West Wicklow area were restructured to three main centres: Naas, Newbridge and Athy.  This service is accessible by telephone call, followed up by appointments and home visits as required.  There is a commitment that all customers will have their telephone call returned within one working day.  This has eliminated the need for unnecessary travel to Department offices.  Emergency cases are prioritised and dealt with appropriately.  All clients were notified of the changes, including the new extended service times and contact details.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 1,500 telephone phone enquiries are received each month in the South Kildare/West Wicklow area.  While statistics are not maintained on the number of telephone calls returned within the commitment of one working day, feedback from staff indicates that this is the case.  However, if the Deputy is aware of any case where difficulties have arisen regarding the level of service provided she should provide details to the Department for review. </p></reply>

For jobseekers allowance, claims are decided, on average in two weeks.  For one parent family payment claims, the average is 6 weeks to award, reflecting the complexity of this payment and the requirement to provide more detailed information.  </p>  <p>  Historically, where there were delays in processing primary claims, then supplementary welfare allowance payments could be made to customers in the interim period pending award.  However, with the improved processing times delivered by the Intreo process, the overall number of supplementary welfare applications pending jobseekers claims has significantly reduced, as an early decision on the primary claims has negated the need for such applications.</p>  <p>  The Intreo process is in line with the Department&rsquo;s Customer Service Charter.   </p></reply>

The JobBridge internship scheme is now available to recipients of a wide range of payments (DA; OFP; Blind Persons Pension; Deserted Wives Allowance/Deserted Wives Benefit; Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s contributory/non-contributory Pension).  Recipients of these payments are not counted on the Live Register.</p><p>In addition, unemployed persons (including those formerly self-employed) not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses).  Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.  Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment.  For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status. </p><p>An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances. </p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.  Within this overall objective it is appropriate to provide priority for those who are in receipt of payments that are conditional on being unemployed. </p><p>In developing the new <i>Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020</i>strategy, the Government engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders including front-line workers delivering employment services to unemployed people.  The strategy reflects the views and ideas gathered during this process as well as taking account of inputs from across all of Government and from agencies such as the OECD and advisory bodies such as the Labour Market Council and the Joint Committee for Education and Social Protection.</p><p>Based on these inputs, the strategy for 2016 to 2020 will reflect a shift in focus from &lsquo;activation in a time of recession&rsquo; to &lsquo;activation in a time of recovery and growth&rsquo; and in this regard should have two main objectives:</p><p>-  First, to continue and consolidate the progress made to date with an initial focus on working with unemployed jobseekers, in particular people who are long-term unemployed.</p><p>-  Second, to extend the approach of activation to other people who, although not classified as unemployed jobseekers, have the potential and the desire to play a more active role in the labour force.</p><p>Accordingly <i>Pathways to Work 2016&ndash;2020</i>includes numerous, specific actions to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market and to apply the concept of active inclusion as a guiding principle  particularly in the period from 2018 - 2020.</p><p>The principal specific actions relevant to job-seekers who are not on the Live Register are as follows:</p><p><b><i>Expand pro-active engagement to other people of working age who are unemployed but not in receipt of a jobseeker payment: </i></b></p><p>1.  Review by 2017 the Jobseeker Transition (JST) activation model and consider whether changes should be made to the structure and operation of the scheme both to improve its effectiveness in supporting lone parents to transition to employment and/or to extend it as an option for other categories of welfare recipient.</p><p>2.  Expand pro-active engagement to people who are working part-time but are in receipt of a welfare payment.</p><p>3.  Develop a pro-active engagement approach to support qualified adult dependants of job-seeker claimants in securing employment.  For example, promote the registration of qualified spouses/partners as jobseekers in their own right.</p><p>4.  Promote the availability of existing services to &lsquo;voluntary engagers&rsquo;/&lsquo;walk-in&rsquo; clients, including immigrants, who are not on the Live Register but wish to avail of employment services.</p><p>5.  Utilise inter-governmental public employment services such as EURES, and build relationships with public employment services in other countries to offer employment services to Irish emigrants seeking to return to work in Ireland.</p><p>6.  Offer Intreo clients access to the Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and to the Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning.</p><p>7.  Incorporate, as appropriate, time spent as an adult recipient or beneficiary of other full-time welfare payments (e.g. as a one-parent family payment recipient, or as a qualified adult dependent of a primary claimant) when assessing eligibility for access to employment supports.</p><p><b><i>Extend and intensify the pro-active engagement approach for people with a disability.</i></b></p><p>1.  Review the range of income supports (including in-work supports) for people with disabilities to ensure payments are aligned between schemes and, if appropriate, amend the payment structure to ensure that it supports a return to work for people who wish to do so.</p><p>2.  Expand the use of Intreo Centres to engage with people with disabilities and increase the number of Intreo staff trained in the provision of employment supports to people with disabilities.</p><p>3.  Complete a review of the EmployAbility Service to increase utilisation of the service by people with disabilities and improve the level of employment placements.</p><p>4.  Complete an analysis of existing databases of people in receipt of disability payments who may have a capacity to work and an interest in employment with a view to offering such people an opportunity to engage with the Intreo and/or the EmployAbility service.</p><p>5.  Consider options to help recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to access activation services as they cease their caring role.</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment or illness for example.   </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for credits, a person must first have entered insurable employment &ndash; he or she must have paid at least one PRSI contribution as an employed contributor and, unless deemed to be exempted, must be be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Subsequently, insured workers may be awarded credits if they claim a social welfare payment because they are out of work, or they are ill or incapacitated, or if they are engaged in certain training or education courses.  When a person does not qualify for a payment, they may sign-on for credits provided they qualify for the award of credits. </p>  <p>  The PRSI class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI employment contribution while working determines the type of credits which may be awarded.  Those whose last paid PRSI contribution was at Class A may be awarded Class A credits.  Those who paid PRSI, for example, at Class D (modified rate contributor) may only be awarded Class D credits.</p>  <p>  If at any stage in their working life, a person has no PRSI paid or credited contributions for two full tax years, they cannot be awarded credits again until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks.  The rationale for this measure centres on the general principle that there should be a reasonable link between entitlement to benefit and a recent participation in the (active) labour force. </p>  <p>  Individuals who do not qualify for a payment but are signing for credits are included in the Live Register statistics.  The Live Register also includes all claimants for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, excluding systematic short-time workers, applicants for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance excluding smallholders/farm assist and other self-employed persons.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Live Register it should be noted that the register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  Unemployment is measured officially by the Central Statistics Office's Quarterly National Household Survey.  A person is unemployed if, in the week before the survey, they were without work and available for work within the next 2 weeks.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions at class A, E, F, G, H, N or S, i.e., a minimum of <i>10 years</i>of paid contributions. </p><p>Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).  Payment rates are banded, on the basis of this calculation. </p><p>&ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of<i>paid</i>contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012. </p><p>As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced for new pensioners as follows -<table><tr><th>Yearly average PRSI contributions</th><th>Personal rate per week, &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>48 or over </td><td>233.30</td></tr><tr><td>40-47</td><td>228.70</td></tr><tr><td>30-39</td><td>209.70</td></tr><tr><td>20-29</td><td>198.60</td></tr><tr><td>15-19</td><td>152.00</td></tr><tr><td>10-14</td><td>93.20</td></tr></table></p><p>The bands in place before this change remained in place for existing pensioners (who qualified before 1 September 2012), and their rates of pension are now as follows -<table><tr><th>Yearly average PRSI contributions</th><th>Personal rate per week, &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>48 or over</td><td>233.30</td></tr><tr><td>20 - 47</td><td>228.70</td></tr><tr><td>15 - 19 </td><td>175.00</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 14</td><td>116.70</td></tr></table></p><p>The additional bands now in place more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life will, generally, benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p><p>It should be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p></reply>

There were over 20,100 rent supplement tenancies awarded during 2015 and over 3,000 during the first three months of 2016 showing that significant numbers of individuals and families are being accommodated under the scheme.</p><p>The Department undertook a review of the rent limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.  The Department continues to closely monitor the situation and has implemented a national targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme.  The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this arrangement to commuter areas over the coming weeks. </p><p>This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,570 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rental payments.  A county breakdown of these cases is provided in the tabular statement for information.</p><p>Under the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs) scheme assistance may also be provided towards rent deposits or rent in advance.  In 2015, the Department provided a total of 2,500 rent deposit payments at a cost of &euro;1.4 million.  From January to March this year, the Department has provided over 530 payments of rent deposits/rent in advance at a cost of approximately &euro;330,000.</p><p>I believe this targeted approach and the recent legislative reforms announced to the private rental sector provide a level of stability for those who require rent supplement support in what has become a highly volatile rental market.</p><p><b>Total Increased Rental Payments &amp;amp; Active HAP Tenancies by County as at 18/04/2016</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>35</td><td></td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>22</td><td></td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>349</td><td>73</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>3,003</td><td>1,958</td><td>4,961</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>155</td><td></td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>51</td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>353</td><td></td><td>353</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>127</td><td></td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>112</td><td></td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>64</td><td></td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>128</td><td></td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>122</td><td></td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>294</td><td></td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>24</td><td></td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>165</td><td></td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>39</td><td></td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>173</td><td></td><td>173</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>15</td><td></td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>177</td><td></td><td>177</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>5,539</td><td>2,031</td><td>7,570</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.</p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week. Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.</p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.</p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the department is that the vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. </p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.</p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post. </p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.  The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.</p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.</p></reply>

In this regard it complements the service provided by the Department&rsquo;s own staff in Intreo Centres and by the Local Employment Service providers.</p>  <p>  Turas Nua Limited is one of two companies with which the Department has entered into contracts for the delivery of JobPath services.  The other company is Seetec Limited.</p>  <p>  Under the contract the companies act as agents of the Department and  must accept, work with and deliver a service to all and any clients that are referred by the Department.  The companies must deliver a guaranteed baseline level of service to all clients.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal advisor who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  A &ldquo;personal progression plan&rdquo; is drawn up that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Clients receive this service over the duration of a year or until they find employment and if they are placed into a job they continue to receive support for at least three months, and up to twelve months, while in employment.</p>  <p>  JobPath providers are paid fees if and when they place clients into sustained employment.  In this regard employment is defined as work of at least thirty (30) hours per week lasting for at least thirteen (13) weeks.  Contractors are paid a fee, in arrears, for each thirteen week period of employment up to a maximum of four payments or one year&rsquo;s work.  This payment approach incentivises the contractors not just to find work for people but to strive to ensure that the work is full-time and sustained.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of JobPath all long term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 - 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to receive employment activation services from a JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  Participants on T&Uacute;S and Gateway are not eligible to receive the JobPath service while they are on such programmes.  However, once they have competed their time on T&Uacute;S or Gateway they may then be selected for JobPath.  </p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish the individual fees that are payable to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of JobPath is not yet completed.  It is expected to be finalised towards mid-year.  Given that clients will spend 52 weeks on JobPath it is necessary to allow sufficient time to elapse before a meaningful assessment can be carried out.  At the present time it is too early to undertake an evaluation of job placement performance.  As indicated in &ldquo;Pathways to Work 2016 &ndash; 2020&rdquo; the Department intends to publish JobPath performance statistics from Q3 2016. </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.</p><p>Child Benefit is currently paid to around 623,607 families in respect of some 1.19 million children, with an estimated expenditure in the order of over &euro;2 billion in 2016.

Entitlement to force majeure leave is limited to circumstances where the immediate presence of the officer is indispensable, at the place where the ill or injured person is situated.  In determining whether an officer is entitled to force majeure leave the following considerations apply:</p>  <p>- the reason is urgent when the officer has to act without delay, there is no advance notice of the illness/injury and there is little time to plan or manage it or to make alternative arrangements.  In this sense, a scheduled hospital appointment or a routine childhood illness would not attract force majeure leave.  An event might be urgent on the first day, but not on subsequent days if the initial urgency has passed;</p>  <p>- the need for the officer&rsquo;s presence is immediate when the officer&rsquo;s presence with the sick person could not have been delayed because of the seriousness/urgency of the illness/injury.  The officer had to be with or go to the sick/injured person without any delay;</p>  <p>- the officer&rsquo;s presence is indispensable when the situation demands the presence of the officer.  Nobody else will do, or will be able to give the support that the sick/injured person requires.</p>  <p>  These three criteria for force majeure leave must apply on each individual day for which force majeure is requested, not just the first day.</p>  <p>  Force majeure leave shall not exceed 3 days in any period of 12 consecutive months or 5 days in any period of 36 consecutive months.  An absence for part of a day is counted as one day for the purposes of force majeure leave.</p>  <p>  During an absence on force majeure leave, an officer is deemed for all purposes to be in employment.  Force majeure leave is paid leave.  It cannot be treated as part of any other leave such as sick leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, annual leave or parental leave to which the officer is entitled.</p>  <p>  The HR Division of my Department is required, in applying the foregoing provisions, to be satisfied that, in the circumstances, an application for force majeure leave is fully justified.  Where this is not the case, the officer should apply for annual leave or other form of special leave.</p></reply>

The original scheme was introduced in 1970 and was extended to include self-employed mothers with effect from June 1997.</p><p>In 2016 it is estimated that my Department will spend approximately &euro;266 million on maternity benefit in respect of an average of 22,000 recipients per week.</p><p>The fundamental qualification criteria for maternity benefit are that a woman must be in insurable employment or self-employment and is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  The applicant must also satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.</p><p>As stated above, to qualify for maternity benefit, a claimant must:</p><p>- be in employment which is covered by the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, immediately before the first day of her maternity leave.  The last day of insurable employment must be within 16 weeks of the end of the week in which her baby is due.  (If she ceases employment, her Maternity Leave must commence from the following day) and</p><p>- be certified by her employer as entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and</p><p>- have her expected date of confinement certified by a registered medical practitioner and</p><p>- have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12 months before the first day of her maternity leave </p><p>or</p><p>- at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the Relevant Tax Year or in the year following the Relevant Tax Year</p><p>or </p><p>- at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Relevant Tax Year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the Tax Year prior to the Relevant Tax Year.</p><p>If a person is pregnant, unemployed and claiming illness benefit they will continue to be paid illness benefit provided they have a condition other than pregnancy to warrant their being on illness benefit. </p><p>Pregnancy itself cannot be used as a medical reason to claim illness benefit.  However, medical complications arising from pregnancy can satisfy the medical criteria for illness benefit.  When the baby is born they may qualify for an increase in their illness benefit for a child dependant. </p><p>If a person is on sick leave from work and getting illness benefit immediately before they are due to start their maternity leave, they will be paid maternity benefit in the normal way if they satisfy the social insurance contributions. </p><p>The social insurance contributions for maternity benefit and illness benefit are not the same.  Therefore, if a person is in employment but on sick leave and not getting illness benefit they may still qualify for maternity leave and maternity benefit.  However, they must satisfy the social insurance contributions.</p><p>Where an individual has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for maternity benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment provided they meet the relevant contingency conditions.  For instance, new mothers who do not qualify for maternity benefit may be eligible for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  This scheme is considered a &quot;safety net&quot; within the overall social welfare system for eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.</p></reply>

Each scheme area continuously monitors and reviews claim processing operations to ensure that customers are responded to as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Processing times vary by scheme but this principally reflects the fact that the eligibility criteria such as means tests, family circumstances and medical status are more complex for some schemes than for others.</p>  <p>  Claims processing in Intreo Centres also involves the scheduling of appointments for new jobseekers and customers are informed of the documentation required in advance of his/her appointment.  This ensures that the claim itself can normally be processed without delay.</p>  <p>  The reduction in the Live Register has enhanced the Department&rsquo;s capacity to process claims in that overall numbers claiming jobseekers payments is reducing year-on-year.  However, it should be noted that the number of people coming on &ndash; and off - the register is substantial and this movement of customers continues to require repeated administrative intervention at each entry point.</p>  <p>  For example, the decrease of 4,123 people on the Live Register in March 2016 was made up of 26,876 people who came onto the register and 30,999 who left. </p>  <p>  The staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising.

In addition to its traditional core business MABS has been developed to provide additional services targeted at supporting mortgage holders in arrears.  Guidance has recently issued to the Departments staff in the Community Welfare Service to inform persons experiencing difficulties with their mortgage repayments of these additional supports.</p>  <p>  A Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS (DMA MABS) service has been established across 24 locations, which is focused on post-MARP cases, assisting mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable option, and where required, negotiating with the lender on the client&rsquo;s behalf.</p>  <p>  Together with the Insolvency Service of Ireland, MABS has established a national network of Court Mentors to attend relevant Courts nationwide, where repossessions hearings are listed, to provide support to distressed borrowers and direct them to the appropriate services which can provide them with the necessary help and assistance.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are currently approximately 2,980 mortgage interest supplement recipients.  This scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 January 2014, with customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 retaining entitlement until the cessation of scheme on 1st January 2018.  The continued payment of mortgage interest supplement, the purpose of which was to provide short-term support to meet mortgage interest repayments, does little to assist families in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem.  It is expected that over the remaining period existing customers will exit the scheme through: sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.</p></reply>

Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 19.0% in March 2016 (as estimated by CSO, compared to 21.5% in March 2015 and with a peak of over 31% in 2012).</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery continues, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee by young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy and the Youth Guarantee plan.</p><p>As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.</p><p>The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with all young people by case officers to discuss and achieve personal progression plans.  For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.</p><p><i>Pathways to Work 2016-2020</i>continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.</p></reply>

An employee is entitled to take carer&rsquo;s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.  Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act ensures that those who propose to avail of carer's leave will have their jobs kept open for them for the duration of the leave.  An employee may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  If they do not qualify for Carer's Benefit they may qualify for Carer's Allowance, which is a means-tested payment.</p><p>The jobseeker's benefit scheme provides income support for people who lose work and who have the required number of social insurance contributions.  The 2016 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;369 million.</p><p>It is a fundamental qualifying condition for the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  The schemes also require that persons must be fully unemployed for at least four in any seven consecutive days.  They must also satisfy social insurance contribution and substantial loss of employment conditionality.</p><p>A person is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if s/he has lost at least one day of insurable employment in any period of 6 days as an officer of the Minister may determine, provided his/her reckonable earnings or reckonable income are reduced as a consequence of the loss of employment.</p><p>The full scheme criteria are established in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended and associated regulations.  These provisions inform detailed scheme guidelines which are available, along with further information on the schemes, at .  Each application for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is assessed by one of the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers on a case by case basis.</p><p>Where an individual does not have entitlement under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, they may qualify for means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Where an individual does not have entitlement under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, they may be eligible for the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is considered the &quot;safety net&quot; within the overall social welfare system.  The SWA scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.</p><p>A person who is not satisfied with the outcome of their claim for a Department of Social Protection payment has the right to appeal against the decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</p></reply>

In 2016, it is expected that expenditure on income support schemes to support the unemployed, lone parents, people with a disability and older people will be &euro;19.6 billion, despite the requirements for fiscal consolidation measures.  The Department is not a direct funder of social programmes delivered by the charitable, community and voluntary sector and, therefore, has not reduced its funding for these organisations.</p>  <p>  The Department does, however, support community initiatives through funding community work placement programmes such as community employment, T&uacute;s, rural social scheme, gateway and the community services programme.  These programmes are delivered locally through sponsor organisations or local development/partnership companies.  During the economic crisis, the Department examined all aspects of its expenditure which resulted in a reduction to some of the funding paid to the sponsor organisations and local development/partnership companies e.g. training grants.  To minimise the effects of these reductions, the Department examined the income and expenditure of schemes that were experiencing difficulties in absorbing the changes made to the grants.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the recovery has allowed some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas.  Any decision to increase grant payments would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-04-20a.254.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016042000059#WRE04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</p>  <p>  Entitlements under the social welfare system are primarily based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded payments at the same time.  As is common with social security systems across the world, the Irish social welfare system generally applies the principle of one person, one payment.  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, e.g., an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one core payment.  Amending the social welfare system to allow Illness Benefit to be paid in addition to a pension such as a Widow&rsquo;s pension would be a significant change to the system, providing certain people with the income considered necessary for two people, and would greatly increase costs.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments.</p>  <p>  Widows over the age of 66 are less likely to be in a position to take up employment than those of working age.  When a person on a Widows&rsquo; contributory pension reaches the age of 66, their rate of payment will generally be aligned with the maximum personal rate for the State pension contributory.  Increasing the rate of payment for widows under 66 to that of those who have reached State pension age would also result in a significant additional cost that would have to be met from either increased PRSI/subvention or a reduction in the rate of payments.  I have no plans to introduce such a change.</p>  <p>  There are a number of supports in the social welfare system which benefit widows, including those of working age.  I was pleased to announce in Budget 2016 that the rate of the Fuel Allowance scheme was increased from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50, which will be of benefit to many disadvantaged widows of all ages, and householders on long-term welfare, and will assist with meeting the costs of their heating needs during the winter season.  To receive Fuel Allowance, Widows pension recipients must also satisfy the other conditions for that payment, i.e., be unable to provide for their heating needs from the resources of their household, live alone or only with one of a list of exempted persons, and satisfy a means test.  All recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means-test.</p>  <p>  In addition, a widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received the Household Benefits package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment.</p></reply>

Over 120,730 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-December, reflecting a 5.3 per cent increase in restructured accounts relative to Q4 2014.  86.4 per cent of restructured accounts were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.</p>  <p>  2. All maturity categories of arrears, including the over 720 days category, declined in Q4 2015, with the over 720 days category recording a second consecutive decline.  Currently the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 720 days stands at 36,351.</p>  <p>  Based on Central Bank data, mortgage accounts with no arrears now make up 88 per cent of all mortgage accounts.  The continuing improvement in data trends shown in the Central Bank quarter 4 mortgage arrears returns are welcome and show that where there is meaningful engagement between lender and borrower, in the majority of cases an outcome that is beneficial to both parties can be reached.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders.  The figures in the latest publication for February 2016 (published on 14 April 2016) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 67,234 representing an improvement of almost 21 per cent compared to February 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will be also be aware that the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and the Consumer Protection Code  provide a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that each borrower who is struggling to keep up mortgage repayments is treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by lenders.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  I would also refer Deputies to a new Government-funded scheme announced by the Minister for Justice in January to help people who are insolvent, and in mortgage arrears on their home, to access independent expert financial and legal advice.  MABS will act as the gateway to refer eligible distressed borrowers to access this scheme.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers with their lender is key to achieving a sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or MABS for an independent assessment of their situation and advice on available resolution options.</p></reply>

The only exceptions in this regard relate to taxpayers who are not e-enabled, for example no technology access or suffer from an infirmity that restricts them from availing of electronic services.</p><p>The introduction of electronic tax clearance (eTC) means that taxpayers no longer need to provide a paper certificate to confirm tax clearance to a third party.  Instead, it can now be verified by simply supplying a system generated 'Tax Clearance Access Number' in addition to the relevant PPSN to the third party in question.  The eTC system is based on real time information rather than at a particular point in time like the old paper based system and where there are issues to be resolved, for example any outstanding tax payments and tax returns, the eTC system confirms the remedial action required of the taxpayer. </p><p>The eTC system, which can be accessed via ROS (business customers) or MyAccount (PAYE and non-ROS customers) has been developed to the very highest standards, is user-friendly and is fully secure.  The system is available twenty four hours a day and can be accessed at a time that best suits individual circumstances.  Revenue has advised me that it has published easy to follow instructions on its website at to assist taxpayers that may experience any difficulties.  Revenue also provides telephone assistance via the Collector-General's Helpline at 1890 203070.  </p><p>In regard to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, Revenue has confirmed to me that the person in question successfully applied for tax clearance through the eTC system on 18 February 2016 and a 'Tax Clearance Access Number' was provided to him.  He is not required to have a hard copy and if a third party has asked him to produce one he should provide the access number and his PPSN to confirm his Tax clearance status.  He can also print the relevant details from his eTC record should he choose to do so.</p></reply>

The policy sets restrictions on the loan-to-value (LTV) and Loan-to-Income (LTI) ratios on products that can be offered by mortgage providers.  There are a number of exemptions allowed for within the CBI guidelines, for example mortgage switchers or forbearance cases.</p><p>I must re-iterate that the macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending are designed, implemented and monitored by the Central Bank in its role as regulator of the Irish banking sector, and therefore fall outside of my remit as Minister for Finance.  Moreover, the Central Bank does not provide prudential lending disclosures on an industry-wide or institutional basis and there is no regulatory requirement for AIB to publicly disclose the value of approved mortgages that are exceptions to the macro-prudential limits.  My role as Minister of Finance, as set out in the Relationship Framework Agreements between the Minister and the banks in which the State is a shareholder, does not involve me in the relationship between the banks and their regulator.  The Relationship Framework Agreement for AIB can be found here: .</p><p>Nonetheless, I have received assurances from AIB that the bank complied fully with Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Loan-to-Income (LTI) limits as set by the Central Bank of Ireland during the year to 31st December 2015, and that AIB continues to operate within the constraints set by its regulator.</p></reply>

These rules are determined by the relevant accounting standards and it is the responsibility of the directors of the respective banks to ensure these rules have been properly applied.  To provide assurance that this is the case, the proper application of the rules is subject to an annual independent external audit review.</p>  <p>  As I have stated in the past, nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that these rules have not been correctly applied by the banks.

At a regional level annual growth in the Dublin market was 9 per cent in Q4 2015.  Similar rental inflation was experienced outside of Dublin with rents increasing by 9.9 per cent compared with Q4 2014. </p>  <p>  The indications are that this increase is being driven by an excess of demand over the available supply in the market.  For example, the Daft Rental Report for Q4 2015 noted that rental inflation has been driven by a shortage of rental properties.  This lack of availability is primarily attributed to the current housing output falling short of the demand for housing.  Forecasts for housing demand suggest that an average of around 25,000 units are required annually over the medium to longer term.  At present, the sector is falling well short of this target with completions in 2015 of just over 12,500 units.</p>  <p>  In such market conditions, it is likely that a reduction in the tax payable by landlords, such as that proposed by the Deputy, could lead to increased profit for landlords rather than a reduction in rent paid by tenants.</p>  <p>  It must also be noted that the level of income tax payable by a landlord in respect of a given amount of rental income can vary significantly, depending on the level of deductible expenses incurred by the landlord.  For example, in the case of rental investment properties which have been purchased using loan financing, it could be expected that the net taxable rental income from a newly-purchased property would be much lower than the net income from an equivalent property owned for a longer term by the landlord, as the deductible interest expense incurred would be higher.</p>  <p>  With regard to rented residential premises, a landlord may, in general, deduct 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises when calculating rental income.  The cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property are deductible.  Wear and tear allowances are also available in respect of expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I introduced in Finance Act 2015 a new tax relief which allows a full 100% mortgage interest deduction where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports.  The relief is designed to incentivise landlords to commit to letting their property to tenants in receipt of social housing supports over the longer term, thereby improving the stability of supply of property to such tenants.</p>  <p>  This relief was one element of an overall package of measures designed by the Government aimed at stabilising rent and boosting supply in the housing market which, in my view, was the most appropriate and effective route to addressing rental price increases driven by supply constraints.</p></reply>

In this regard, section 774(7)(a) provides that relief for ordinary annual contributions is given by way of a deduction in determining the employee's income tax liability under Schedule E for the year in which the contributions are paid. </p><p>Relief for an employee's ordinary annual contributions is normally provided by an employer under what is known as the net pay arrangement whereby the contributions are deducted from gross remuneration before tax under Schedule E is calculated.  In the case of special contributions, relief is normally granted by way of a claim made by the taxpayer to Revenue after the end of the relevant tax year. </p><p>In any tax year, the amount of contributions on which relief can be granted to an employee is limited to an age-related percentage of the employee's remuneration from the office or employment in respect of which the contributions are paid (subject to an overall annual earnings cap, which currently stands at &euro;115,000).</p><p>The age-related percentages are as follows:<table><tr><th>Age</th><th>% of Remuneration</th></tr><tr><td>Under 30 </td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>30 to 39</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>40 to 49</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>50 to 54</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>55 to 59</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>60 or over </td><td>40</td></tr></table></p><p>Where a person's contributions in a year exceed the amount on which relief can be granted (based on his or her age-related percentage limit or the overall earnings cap as appropriate), section 774(7)(d) provides that the unrelieved amount is carried forward and treated as a contribution made in a later year or years. </p><p>The carry forward of unrelieved contributions under section 774(7)(d) is provided for only in cases where an individual's pension contributions in a year exceed the amount for which relief can be granted in that year. It is not provided for in any other circumstances.</p><p>In relation to the specific questions the Deputy has posed regarding the number of instances where this relief was granted by way of carry forward or refunded to executives of State agencies during the period of their assignment abroad, data are not collected in respect of section 774(7)(d) in a manner which enables Revenue to isolate these claims or the amounts associated with this particular aspect of the relief.</p><p>Finally, if the Deputy's query concerns a particular individual then that individual may wish to contact his or her local Revenue office who should be able to assist in any queries they may have with regard to the operation of section 774(7)(d).</p></reply>

One of the available phased payment options is Deduction at Source from ten separate payment schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).</p><p>The Deputy should note that deductions are not taken from Jobseekers Allowance as the temporary and intermittent nature of the allowance could result in shortfalls in the amount of LPT deducted leaving property owners with outstanding liabilities at year-end.  Also, the concept of a de minimis welfare payment from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) is enshrined in social welfare legislation and deductions that would have the effect of reducing a person's take-home amount to below the minimum weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, currently &euro;186 per week, cannot be made.  In regard to the operation of &quot;deduction at source&quot; (DAS) from DSP payments, it has been ensured, through ongoing dialogue between Revenue and DSP officials, that individuals impacted by the &euro;186 threshold are given early notification that Local Property Tax (LPT) payments cannot be deducted and alternative payment methods are put in place.</p><p>In cases where LPT cannot be deducted from DSP payments, there are other phased payment options available to assist property owners in spreading the liability over the course of the year.  These options include monthly Direct Debits through banks and certain credit union accounts and flexible payments through four approved Payment Service Providers including An Post, Payzone, Omnivend and PayPoint.  Each of these service providers applies various transaction charges that are outside of Revenue's control.</p><p>The option to defer payment of LPT is provided for in Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) including full Deferral and Partial Deferral (50%) of LPT liabilities for property owners meeting certain conditions including 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'.  The income threshold for a full deferral is &euro;15,000 (single person) per annum and &euro;25,000 (couple) per annum and for a partial deferral is &euro;25,000 (single person) per annum or &euro;35,000 (couple) per annum.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments.  However, 'Deferral' and 'Partial Deferral' are not exemptions and the tax becomes payable at a later date and carries an annual interest rate of 4%.</p><p>Any property owners who wish to apply for a 'Deferral' or 'Partial Deferral', can access their records online at and amend the payment instruction as required.  Alternatively they can contact the LPT Helpline at 1890200255 where an agent will confirm any balances due and assist with making alternative payment arrangements, including Deferral/Partial Deferral as necessary.</p><p>I engaged Dr Don Thornhill to consider the operation of the Local Property Tax, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to recent property price developments.  In his report on his review of the Local Property Tax - which was published on Budget Day 2015 - Dr Thornhill made a number of recommendations including that the existing deferral provisions should be continued and be reviewed and revised at frequent intervals.  Dr Thornhill also recommended that for owner-occupiers over 80 years of age or those with stated certified long term illnesses and disabilities who are living alone, consideration be given to raising the income limit for deferrals to &euro;20,000. </p><p>In my Budget 2016 statement, I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered fully by the next Government.</p><p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers 11 and 12 respectively).</p><p>As I have indicated, issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report will be a matter for further consideration.</p></reply>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.</p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Minister for Finance work together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  A number of matters have been raised in this question which I will address in the order in which each was asked.</p>  <p>  - The Department has received a number of social housing proposals which are at various stages of development.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the Department primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing.  It must be pointed out that any such proposal, including the funding of SMEs will ultimately be a matter for regulatory approval by the Registrar of Credit Unions.</p>  <p>  - The Personal Microcredit Scheme was commenced on a pilot basis in November 2015.  30 credit unions are involved in providing individual loans of between &euro;100 and &euro;2,000 with a maximum interest rate of 12%.  The initiative is being led by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other interest groups.  Monitoring data are being collected on a regular basis which will inform the structure and support necessary for a national roll-out.</p>  <p>  - The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is currently carrying out a review of implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  This report is due to be completed by end June 2016.</p>  <p>  - The Government provided &euro;250 million in the Credit Union Fund.  This funding is ring-fenced specifically to provide financial support for credit unions restructuring under the Credit union Restructuring Board (ReBo).  The terms of the Restructuring Scheme, agreed between the Department of Finance and DG Competition at the European Commission are specific to restructuring credit unions and are measures granted under a State aid scheme.  There is no flexibility within the Scheme to provide funding for any measure other than restructuring.</p>  <p>  - The Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union, authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland being unable to repay deposits.  The DGS protects depositors up to &euro;100,000 per person per institution.  While Article 13(1) of the DGS Directive states that Member States may provide for lower contributions for low-risk sectors regulated under national law, this must be read in conjunction with the entirety of Article 13 and, in particular, Article 13(2) which states that the method for calculating contributions to the DGS shall be approved by the competent authority which is the Central Bank, in co-operation with the designated authority, which also the Central Bank.  In accordance with the requirements of Article 13, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued guidelines on methods for calculating contributions to DGSs.  Competent authorities must ensure that these guidelines are applied by DGSs when developing methods for calculating risk-based contributions by their members.  The Central Bank as the competent authority has indicated that it intends to follow those guidelines.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the calculation methodology currently being developed will assess and rank each credit institution separately.  Therefore, individual credit unions will be separately assessed and ranked, and those deemed to be lower risk under the risk categories as set out in the EBA guidelines will pay a lower contribution.  Conversely, individual credit unions deemed to be higher risk under these risk categories will pay a higher contribution.  It is important to highlight that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can act outside the parameters of Article 13 as a whole, which gives the Central Bank the mandate to determine and calculate risk based contributions.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

This is the largest decline across all EU Member States for whom data is available. </p>  <p>  The decline in unit labour costs in 2015 is a continuation of the trend of significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness since 2008 (the peak year for unit labour costs in Ireland).  It is estimated that nominal unit labour costs in Ireland fell by 20 percent between 2008 and 2015.  This compares with an increase of 14 per cent in the UK and 9 per cent in the euro area over the same time period.</p>  <p>  In addition, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last number of years has contributed to the improvement in Ireland's competitiveness as Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to those of our euro area peers.  For instance, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below or equal that of the euro area every year since 2008. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to support growth.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against Sterling.  Similarly gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  Therefore we need to stay focused on continuing to improve Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and productivity improvements.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to the charges applied by credit institutions.  Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services.  Section 149 does not cover interest rates, rather it applies to fees and commissions only.  The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution.  Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.</p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013.  This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges.  It is available on my Department's website at .  Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers.</p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers.

In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU/UK relationship.  The research was published on 5 November 2015 and is an important contribution to understanding the potential issues arising. </p>  <p>  My Department, and other Government Departments, are continuing our assessment of all the issues involved in protecting Ireland's interests and we are continuing to explore the potential risks and to plan accordingly in the period up to 23 June 2016.</p></reply>

They may carry out flood alleviation works from their own resources or apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.   </p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of and impact from flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.   </p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. </p>  <p>  Good progress is being made on the CFRAM Programme, the draft mapping is now being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation on 23rd December, 2015.  Work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is underway.  Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The Plans, which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie. </p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. </p>  <p>  The OPWs Capital Investment Programme has already seen 36 major flood relief schemes implemented since 1995.  The Government has allocated &euro;80.7m in 2016 for the OPW's overall Flood Risk Management Programme of which &euro;52.5m is for the continued implementation of the comprehensive programme of capital flood relief works.  There are currently five major schemes at construction in Bray Co. Wicklow, River Dodder Dublin, South Campshires Dublin, Ennis Lower, and Phases 2, 3 and 4 in Waterford City.  There are a further 26 schemes at design and planning stage and, of these, it is anticipated that construction works on schemes in Claregalway Co. Galway, Bandon and Skibbereen in Co. Cork, Templemore Co. Tipperary and Foynes Co. Limerick will be commenced this year. </p>  <p>  Other schemes in the capital works programme will be advanced through the planning or Confirmation (Ministerial approval) processes and every effort will be made to also progress some of these schemes to construction in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The OPW has statutory responsibility for maintenance of the drainage works carried out by it under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995.  Each year the OPW carries out work to approximately 2,000km of channels and about 200 structures around the country as part of its ongoing and rolling arterial drainage maintenance programme.  While the average cycle of maintenance is generally in the range 4 to 7 years, the OPW assesses annually the maintenance requirement.</p>  <p>  Prior to the enactment of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 various drainage works were carried out in locations around the country.

It is important to learn from such practical experience of where community benefit clauses are utilised.  This is a complex area.  It is important to develop a robust structure that will assist the contracting authority to develop the correct clause and to provide the support from the appropriate agency to aid the company in implementing the clause.  I have instructed the OGP to issue practical guidance designed to assist Contracting Authorities to carry out this important role in a consistent manner.  I expect that this guidance to issue shortly after the transpostion of the new public procurement Directives.</p></reply>

It is open to the Councils to undertake any local flood mitigation works using their own resources or, if necessary,  to submit an application for funding under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection scheme. </p>  <p>  To date in 2016, the OPW has approved funding of &euro;52,530 to Monaghan County Council under the above scheme in respect of proposed projects at Drummillard/Lakeview, Castleblaney (&euro;37,530) and Corleck/Annahaia (&euro;15,000 for study).</p>  <p>  Applications for funding from Monaghan County Council in respect of two other proposed projects at the Bunnoe river and at Donaghmoyne (Carrickmacross) are currently being assessed by OPW engineering staff.  No applications for funding from Cavan County Council are currently to hand in the OPW.</p>  <p>  All applications for funding under the Minor Works administrative scheme are assessed in accordance with the eligibility criteria for the scheme which includes a requirement that all proposed works are cost beneficial and subject to the availability of funding for flood risk management.  The eligibility criteria for the scheme are published on the OPW's website www.opw.ie</p>  <p>  The OPW only funds drainage works related to fluvial or river flooding.  Any necessary works to address flooding caused by pluvial or inadequate surface water drainage systems are the responsibility of the local authority.  The local authority is responsible also for the ongoing maintenance of certain watercourses within Drainage Districts in the county.</p>  <p>  The OPW carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments nationally.  These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands.  The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.</p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Cavan in 2016 includes work on some 18km on the Inny scheme, approximately 7km on the Boyne scheme and 3km Glyde and Dee scheme.</p>  <p>  The planned OPW maintenance programme in Co Monaghan in 2016 includes work on approximately 65km of the Monaghan Blackwater Arterial Drainage Scheme and some 35km of the Glyde and Dee scheme.</p></reply>

The focus of the NCC&rsquo;s analysis was on commercial insurance costs as they pertain to business &ndash; life assurance and health insurance costs were excluded.  The NCC examined the nature of the commercial insurance market in Ireland and provides an overview of the competitiveness of the commercial insurance market in Ireland, compared to European and non-European counterparts. </p><p>Overall, it found that, at present, the Irish commercial non-life market is competitive but not particularly attractive to new entrants given relatively low levels of profitability.

No. 116 of 2005).  The transposed provisions are now reflected in Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014 and, insofar as they relate specifically to credit institutions, in the European Union (Credit Institutions: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 266 of 2015).</p>  <p>  Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, was due to be transposed by 20 July 2015.  Heads of Bill to give effect to that Directive were approved by Government in February 2015 and are with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. </p>  <p>  The question of whether any particular Directive is binding in the absence of national transposing legislation is a legal one.  As a rule, EU Directives are addressed to Member States, who are then obliged to implement them, and not to individuals or companies.</p>  <p>  The content of Regulation (EC) 1606 of 2002 was adopted at EU Level, so any proposal to amend that content would be a matter for the EU legislature. </p>  <p>  That said, the Regulation does include options for Member States to consider. </p>  <p>  Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards requires companies with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market (as defined) of any Member State to prepare their consolidated accounts (financial statements) in conformity with international accounting standards adopted by the European Commission in accordance with the procedure specified in the Regulation.  This requirement has direct legal effect but is supported by section 1376 of the Companies Act 2014.  </p>  <p>  Article 5 of the Regulation then gives Member States the option to permit or require a wider use of international accounting standards.  In Ireland, this wider use is permitted but not required.  The use of the option is now reflected in Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014.  In the specific context of banks, Regulations 3 to 5 of the European Union (Credit Institutions: Financial Statements) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 266 of 2015) are relevant.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law.  </p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p>  <p>  In relation to public awareness, the WRC maintains a high profile as the State body primarily responsible for information and compliance on employment rights in a number of ways.  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  To ensure that awareness of these obligations is maintained, the WRC collaborates with key partners including civil society organisations, the trade union movement, employer organisations and other State bodies.  WRC publications are widely distributed through the offices of community organisations, NGOs and Citizen Information Offices.  The WRC also participates in conferences and events and makes presentations not only to employer and employee groups but also to community and educational groups. </p></reply>

This is because UK membership of the Union is hugely important both to Ireland&rsquo;s interests, and to the interests of a stable, successful and prosperous EU as a whole.  The Government&rsquo;s overriding focus has been, and remains, on helping to keep the UK in the Union, not preparing for its departure.</p>  <p>  Work has been underway across Government Departments, including my own, for some time to ensure we best understand the range of issues at stake.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Taoiseach also plays a leading role, given the whole-of-government dimension that is essential in this work.  In this context, last May, a unit was established in the Department of the Taoiseach, specifically dealing with British-Irish and Northern Ireland affairs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, for example, commissioned the research published last November by the Economic and Social Research Institute on Irish-British macroeconomic links in the context of our joint EU membership.</p>  <p>  We know from this and various other published assessments that there are very significant strategic and economic risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU.  In order to mitigate these risks, the Government played a constructive role in the negotiations that took place at EU level, including in the context of the discussions leading up to the European Council in February, working with the British Government and all our EU partners towards a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the Union.</p>  <p>  Given the importance to the enterprise sector of this issue, both IDA and Enterprise Ireland are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and continue to track where potential impacts may arise.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the pace at which any potential exit was achieved, and the terms which the UK might negotiate with the EU across a wide range of domains will be a key determinant of the impact on the economy, particular sectors and individual firms.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources.  These include Lean Programmes, Market Diversification, Innovation and Management Development.  These will be the tools available to assist companies with planning and preparation.</p>  <p>  Further, a key policy priority in recent years both for my Department and for Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification, so that Irish owned exports to non-UK markets increase by 50% to reach exports of between &euro;5 and &euro;6 billion by 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result, both Service and Manufacturing firms exports have shown a clear reduction in dependency on the UK market.  A growing number of Enterprise Ireland supported exporters are exporting to more than five countries - an indication of a strengthening resilience in market diversity terms.  In 2014, 41.8% of EI assisted exporting firms exported to more than five countries compared to 33% in 2009.</p></reply>

The LEOs provide advice and direction, covering all government supports and requirements, to anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  This information is easily accessed through the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; online search tool at: <i>.</i></p><p>The LEOs can also provide funding for projects that meet certain criteria, generally with regard to export potential, and other non-financial supports such as training and mentoring.  Businesses should contact their local LEO by telephone or by email - contact details for all LEOs are available at: .</p><p>A new online tool which sets out the variety of supports available to all enterprises across all sectors is embedded or linked to over 30 Government websites including my Department&rsquo;s website and the websites of the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) works in partnership with Irish enterprises to help them start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets.  They provide funding and supports for companies - from entrepreneurs with business propositions for a high potential start-up through to large companies expanding their activities, improving efficiency and growing international sales.  Availability of all EI supports are communicated via and also through EI&rsquo;s Development Advisors, EI Regional Offices and through public calls for applications. </p><p>In September 2015 I launched a new guide setting out the range of State supports available for the manufacturing sector.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s plans to support employment growth in the manufacturing sector, a key step is to ensure that businesses in the sector become more aware of the Government supports that are available to support them in their expansion.  This new brochure which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website brings together all these services in a single publication to assist the sector to tap into these supports and clarify the details of what is available from the various Government Organisations and Agencies.  Details are at: .</p><p>In the area of access to finance, the last Government introduced a range of initiatives - from Microfinance Ireland to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and from the Credit Guarantee Scheme to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund - and continued to invest in seed and venture capital through Enterprise Ireland.  These initiatives remain available and accessible to business and continue to provide increased access to credit and finance for Irish enterprise.</p><p>The Design and Crafts Council works closely with Enterprise Ireland to create and sustain jobs, and grow exports in the design sector.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2016, the Council will continue to work to increase the profile of the design and craft sector in Ireland through its involvement in a number of key initiatives which will seek to maximise the economic impact and job creation potential of the sector.

Over 3,300 foreign-owned companies have put down roots in Ireland.  These include many of the world&rsquo;s most successful global businesses, which have chosen Ireland as their strategic base in Europe.</p><p>The number of new investments secured by IDA Ireland in 2015 rose by 8% against a background of global economic uncertainty, intense competition from other jurisdictions and a changing global taxation landscape.  There are now 187,056 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies.  This is the highest in the history of the Agency</p><p>More than one in five private sector jobs in the economy result from FDI, representing a vital economic contribution by the multinational sector.  Net job creation by the IDA supported client companies was 11,833 in 2015.  This was as a result of the strong pipeline of new investments and the lowest ever level of job losses as a percentage of overall employment by the sector.  54% of all jobs created in 2015 were based outside of Dublin, demonstrating the strength and resilience of FDI in regional locations.</p><p>More broadly, our efforts to continue to attract international investment in Ireland will be guided by both my Department&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s own five-year strategy <i>&ldquo;Winning - Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rdquo;. </i>The strategy details both how the Agency will broaden its target sectors further and seek new markets over the next five years.  Its ambitious targets include boosting FDI in Ireland by over 40% and creating 80,000 new jobs in the economy. </p><p>As part of the growth strategy, IDA Ireland is committed to increasing the level of investment into each region of Ireland by between 30% and 40% by working closely with local stakeholders.  This investment includes a &euro;150m property investment plan, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in regional locations.</p><p>A strong economy with full employment that supports vibrant public services for our people is within our grasp if we make the right choices.</p></reply>

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies employing 1,931 people in the county.</p>  <p>  In the first quarter of 2016, there was one site visit by a potential investor to Co. Kerry.  For reasons of client confidentiality, it is not possible for IDA Ireland to provide details of the visit.  It should be noted that data on site visits is not a true measure of FDI activity in a region or county, given that 70% of all new FDI investment comes from existing client companies.</p>  <p>  This Government, through the development of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional, has placed an increased emphasis on supporting business development and jobs growth in all regions.  Published last July, the South West Action Plan for Jobs (SWAPJ) focuses on Cork and Kerry.  This plan aims to develop the full potential of the region through the delivery of 261 collaborative actions focusing on increasing the number of start-ups, developing the capacity of existing enterprises, winning new IDA Ireland investments and capitalising on the strengths and opportunities of the region. </p>  <p>  While my Department has facilitated the compilation of the SWAPJ through engagements with stakeholders in the South West, ownership of the Plan &ndash; and ensuring its delivery - rests with the people, businesses, education providers and public bodies in the South West Region. </p>  <p>  As part of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process, IDA Ireland is set to invest &euro;150 million over five years in property solutions designed to allow it to create opportunities to win additional projects for all regions.  This investment includes the delivery of an advance facility in Tralee, Co. Kerry.</p>  <p>  The IDA Ireland property investment programme is a positive development for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into regional locations.  It will provide access to modern property solutions which, when combined with a strong local talent pool and existing FDI cluster, will give these locations an enhanced proposition to offer international investors. </p>  <p>  The tender process is underway for the appointment of a contractor for the construction of the facility in Tralee.  The notification of the decision to grant planning permission was received from Kerry County Council on 25 February 2016 and the contractor will be appointed after the final grant of planning permission is received by IDA Ireland.  The anticipated completion of the building is quarter 1 2017.</p></reply>

From 1 October 2015, all complaints fall to be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance, and, on appeal, to the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s core services include the provision of early resolution, mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services, adjudication on employment and equality complaints, the monitoring of employment conditions to ensure the compliance and enforcement of employment rights legislation, the provision of information, and the processing of employment agency and protection of young persons (employment) licences. </p>  <p>  The WRC is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the WRC is working in conjunction with the Office of Public Works to identify offices/venues for possible use for hearing venues.

This publication is the outcome of research by Teagasc and AFBI (Agri-Food and Bioscience Institute, Belfast) and contains information in relation to Pests and pest control.  It is noted that beetle populations vary considerably from year to year and that a heavy infestation in a particular year does not mean that the following year will be equally affected.  The Guidelines also advise that if population numbers are large, they can be reduced by target spraying the borders of the plantation with insecticide when the beetles are re-colonising the plantation from their overwintering sites in early spring.  The Guidelines however advise that this is a one-off operation and routine spraying is not recommended for both economic and ecological reasons.</p>  <p>  As there tends to be a large amount of parasitism and predation of willow beetle eggs from natural enemies, any chemical intervention needs to be sympathetic to natural control mechanisms.  While currently there are no insecticides authorised for use on willow, my officials are examining the possibility of issuing such approval.</p></reply>

These include the Basic Payments Scheme, which incorporated payments under the former Grassland Sheep Scheme, provided exclusively for the sheep sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, a range of schemes under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014 -2020 have been designed to support the sheep sector.  Sheep farmers continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.  The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the lifetime of the RDP. </p>  <p>  Funding has also been made available under the RDP for the Green Low Carbon Agri Environment Scheme (GLAS).  Access to GLAS is on a tiered basis with those in Tier 1 receiving priority.  Tier 1 participants are mainly those with Priority Environment Assets, which include Natura Land and Commonage.  Many sheep farmers are commonage shareholders and will qualify for Tier 1 access.  Some 38,000 farmers have been approved under the first two tranches of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  Increased provision has also been made for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under Knowledge Transfer Groups under the RDP.  Building on the successful Sheep Technology Adoption Programme, it is expected that the Sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  A range of capital supports for sheep farmers is also available under the TAMS II scheme, including: solid floor housing with or without penning, slatted floor housing, mobile sheep handling facilities, fixed sheep handling facilities, replacement of sheep slats in addition to many other capital investments available to all livestock enterprises such as manure pits, silage pits etc.   </p>  <p>  Additionally approval has been sought by DAFM from the European Commission to include sheep fencing as an eligible item of expenditure in the TAMS II.   </p>  <p>  My Department also funds the activities of Teagasc, Bord Bia and Sheep Ireland in the areas of research, advice, education, breed improvement and marketing and promotion.</p>  <p>  In relation to a further direct payment per ewe, any coupled payment would require a redistribution of existing funds and would involve cuts in other farm payments from Pillar 1.  Any nationally funded payment would have to be considered in the context of exchequer funding availability and also State aid.  Any consideration of further funding for the sheep sector under the RDP could only be considered in the context of an overall review of the implementation of the RDP and would require a re-distribution of funds within the RDP.   </p>  <p>  The sheep sector is an important component of our agriculture sector and the third largest farming sector in Ireland with over 34,000 producers and 2015 proved to be another good year for the sheep sector.  A combination of higher carcase weight (up 1.9%) and higher factory prices (up 1.5%) meant that output value of the sector increased by over 3%.  Total sheepmeat exports increased by an estimated 5% to &euro;230 million between 2014 and 2015.  At farm level, prices reached highs not seen in five years and thankfully these strong prices have continued into this year. </p>  <p>  Increasing consumer demand and market access is a key component in driving the growth in the sheep farming sector in addition to improving technical efficiencies at farm level.  My Department continually works on securing new markets for all Irish agri-food products including sheep meat.  In addition last year Commissioner Hogan set up the Sheepmeat Reflections Group at EU level to examine the sheep sector and the support it needs going forward in order to continue to make an important contribution to agricultural output.  My Department is participating in this group and I expect the outcome of this exercise to be reflected in future deliberations on EU policy in the sheep sector.</p></reply>

As outlined in a previous answer to Parliamentary Question Number 290 of 6 April 2016, a chemical re-evaluation of the sediments was carried out in 2015 and early 2016, as part of the current development proposal.  Results currently indicate that at least 85% is suitable for disposal at sea, subject to EPA approval. </p>  <p>  My Department intends to submit a Dumping At Sea Application to the Environmental Protection Agency in the coming months.  Any material that is determined to exceed the environmental standards set for sea disposal will not be dumped at sea.

The issue of disposal of quantities of contaminated dredge spoil is a matter which is regularly encountered in marine dredging works.

The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicated that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility would be constructed.</p>  <p>  I informed both groups that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I indicated at the time that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  In this connection, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the last EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.  At the time, this agreement was welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  It is now up to those same entities to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.

The application to the National Reserve was not successful as the applicants were deemed to have exceeded the &euro;40,000 income threshold.  The application to the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme was not successful as the applicants held no activated entitlements in 2015, the basis upon which the Young Farmers &rsquo; Scheme is paid.

After consultation with this Committee it was decided that an off farm income limit of &euro;40,000 would be applied to all applicants under the 2015 National Reserve.  The corresponding off farm income limit under the previous National Reserve was &euro;30,000.  Applicants under the 2015 National Reserve also have the flexibility of choosing either the 2013 or 2014 tax year, whichever is more advantageous.   </p>  <p>  The Terms and Conditions of the National Reserve clearly state that for joint applicants under the National Reserve, such as in the case of the persons named, the gross off-farm income of all persons named on the herd number is taken into consideration.  The Department of Social Protection &lsquo;State Pension&rsquo;, including Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension is excluded from the calculation to determine off-farm income.  Retirement pensions resulting from other employment are reckonable as off-farm income under the 2015 National Reserve.</p></reply>

I am very conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  It is for this reason that I proposed measures at the March meeting of Agriculture Ministers specifically for the sector including the re-opening of the PSA scheme for pigmeat which I&rsquo;m pleased to say was accepted by Commission.</p>  <p>  Given the strategic importance which the sector plays in our agri-economy, I established last year a Pig Industry Stakeholder Group which was chaired by Dr Sean Brady and whose membership was drawn from across the sector, including farmers and processors.  This Group&rsquo;s remit was to address these challenges facing the sector under themes such as biosecurity, animal welfare, quality assurance, antiobiotic usage, animal health, salmonella control programme, marketing, feed, non-intensive sector and other production models.  This was a very comprehensive exercise stretching over many months which also included a public consultation phase during which submissions were received and presented to the Committee by many different stakeholders.  The Group completed its report in February and presented it to the High Level Implementation Committee overseeing the implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  This reflected the fact that the preparation of this report is one of the key recommendations under the Food Wise Strategy. </p>  <p>  This timely report afforded all industry stakeholders including farmers, processors and Government Agencies a chance to take a collective view of how best to address the challenges facing the industry in order to support its development in accordance with the Food Wise 2025 vision.  The focus now must turn to its implementation and my Department is working on a plan for its implementation in the context of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Given the comprehensive nature of the report, its support from stakeholders and its wide-ranging conclusions I believe that a focus on its implementation represents best use of available resources for all parties and most importantly will deliver the most meaningful outcome for the sector in its current difficulties.</p></reply>

In 2015 export volumes increased by approximately 8%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets.  Export values at &euro;570 million, fell marginally by 2% during 2015 due to lower pig prices.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices followed by a supply response and/or a recovery in demand.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and a half and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  This is not an exclusively Irish phenomenon, and Irish prices have actually remained ahead of the EU average for the last five months.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.</p>  <p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I put forward a number of measures for the pigmeat and dairy sectors which I believe were needed immediately to help producers through their current difficulties.  On pigmeat my priority was to secure the re-opening of the Pigmeat Private Storage Aid Scheme as I believe its closure did not appear justified by the current state of the EU and global pigmeat market.  Given that the sector does not enjoy direct EU supports, market tools available in times of extreme price volatility must be deployed when necessary.  I am pleased to note that the Commission has agreed to the re-opening of this scheme in 2016.  At the April meeting I reiterated the need to move quickly on the proposals agreed in order to bring about the desired stabilising effects.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian pigmeat ban, the adverse effects of the effective closure of this market are still being felt by farmers.  Ireland has requested the Commission to continue and intensify its political, technical and diplomatic efforts to unlock the Russian market for EU pigmeat.  We proposed that the Commission reengage and secure access for products outside the scope of the Presidential decree, such as pig fats and offals.</p>  <p>  In the interim, a direct aid package payment will issue in the coming week to all pig farmers in Ireland with a minimum level of supply of 200 pigs slaughtered in 2015.  This means a flat rate payment of over &euro;3,000 to each farmer.  This will ensure that the payment is directed to those farmers most affected by price volatility, thus meeting the requirements of the EU Regulations providing the funding.  Furthermore, Commissioner Hogan has reiterated his determination to promote the EU&rsquo;s interests and open up new markets for EU products, with a specific &euro;30 million envelope for dairy and pigmeat available under the EU Promotion Scheme to reflect the market disturbances in those sectors.  Ireland, through Bord Bia, will be making an application for a proportion of this funding in the very near future. </p></reply>

Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into early 2016.</p>  <p>  Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but 2016 will be a challenging year.</p>  <p>  Production decisions are made by producers, taking prevailing market conditions as well as their efficiency of production and price of inputs into account.  The challenge posed by price volatility has been highlighted by my Department and others over a number of years, and indeed my Department has, including through its agencies, invested significant resources in providing farmers with advice and technology designed to improve on farm efficiency, reduce production costs, and make farm businesses more resilient in times of downward price pressure.  The abolition of dairy quotas in April 2015 allows farmers the freedom to make these production decisions on a commercial basis.</p>  <p>  That said, we obviously must offer support to the sector in times of prevailing difficulty such as we are now experiencing.  In this respect, I very much welcome the Presidency conclusions on the proposal for the package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors which was agreed in Brussels at last month&rsquo;s Council.  This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties being experienced in the sector, where the duration of market turbulence has gone well beyond previous expectations.</p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission and other Member States in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter.  I also welcome the Commissioner&rsquo;s undertaking to consider further flexibilities in the PSA scheme for Skimmed Milk Powder, and to look at further flexibilities in the State Aid regime.</p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers and I understand that the Commission is looking favourably on this request.  The Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department is in the final stages of issuing &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers funded by the exchequer and the EU.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, with respect to financial instruments, I welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. </p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.  We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.</p></reply>

These twin imperatives informed my approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.</p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that I proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because I wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector.  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements.  Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment.  I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market.  As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.</p>  <p>  I have also taken significant steps to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, I have ensured that young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve.  These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes.</p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential.  Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint).  I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.</p></reply>

In addition to these value increases, the dairy industry targeted a 50% increase in milk production by 2020, to be progressed following the abolition of milk quotas in April last year.</p><p>Progress on those targets were monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The fourth annual report <i>&ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&quot;</i>, published September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained.</p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July last year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025: increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; increasing value added in the sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion; and increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion.  With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.  Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved.</p><p>I chair the High Level Implementation Committee, including senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies, which will drive implementation of the Food Wise recommendations.  The HLIC has met three times so far. The fourth meeting takes place tomorrow and will deal specifically with competitiveness and the dairy sector. </p></reply>

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many Third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.  2015 was a very successful year for meat exports.  According to Bord Bia overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to &euro;3.5 billion.  Although exports to the EU account for the majority of meat exports, Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.</p>  <p>  I am constantly seeking to develop long-term trading relationships in new and expanding international markets for Irish meat products, raising the profile of Ireland and increasing international confidence in Irish meat production and control systems.  Since taking office I have led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan, West Africa and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports, and to open up new markets abroad.</p>  <p>  These initiatives and efforts have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to the USA, Japan, the Philippines, Canada, Singapore, Egypt, Iran and Oman; to export sheepmeat to Canada, Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the UAE, Canada and Oman; to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia; and to export poultry meat to Singapore and the UAE.</p>  <p>  The opening of the US market to Irish beef in early 2015 has provided an important outlet that holds enormous potential for future development given that we are the first EU Member State to gain access.  An estimated 1,800 tonnes valued at &euro; 14 million was exported in 2015.  In Quarter 1 of 2016 approximately 700 tonnes with a value of &euro;6 million are estimated to have been exported, continuing the positive trends from last year.  My Department remains engaged with the US authorities to allow for the extension of beef exports to include manufacturing beef/Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG).</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made along the path to securing access to the Chinese market for Irish beef with the lifting of the BSE ban by China in February 2015, and an inspection visit by a delegation from AQSIQ to Ireland was hosted in January 2016.  Steps have been taken towards the opening of the Israeli market for beef exports once again following an audit visit to approve selected plants in February 2016.  A delegation from South Korea is expected to conduct a systems audit visit regarding beef access in May.</p>  <p>  Other market access opportunities being actively pursued at present include beef access for Vietnam, pigmeat access for Mexico and beef and pigmeat access for the Ukraine.  The search for new markets will continue in conjunction with various stakeholders.  This will also be guided by the implementation of Food Wise 2025 strategy which identified the future global growth opportunities which Ireland is well placed to benefit from, including: our reputation for food safety and controls; our natural competitive advantage in sustainable grass-based production; and a world class agri-food industry, backed by strong State support services.  These strengths and opportunities should enhance our search for new Third Country markets.</p></reply>

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b></b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.</p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department. </p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.  Inspection finding reports are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Charges for the use of facilities and services at each of the Fishery Harbour Centres are levied by virtue of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates &amp;amp; Charges) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 214 of 2012) which came into effect on 1 July 2012.  Different rates apply according to the type and nature of the vessel, the different use made of the facilities by the vessel, the size of the vessel and the quantity and species of fish landed (where applicable).</p><p>The mandatory nature of the charges referred to is nothing new, and is consistent with the situation as it pertained in the previous Order S.I. No. 439 of 2003.  For ease of reference and for clarification, the relevant charges under S.I. No. 214 of 2012 are set out in the following table.</p><p>S.I. No. 214 of 2012 provides <i>inter alia</i>that charge no. 9 of Schedule 1 for the use of fresh water is &ldquo;...mandatory on all vessels using a Fishery Harbour Centre whether or not they use fresh water...&rdquo; other than vessels paying under charge no. 5, charge no. 10 in Schedule 1 or charge no. 17 in Schedule 2. In this regard, please note the following:</p><p>-  Charge no. 5 of Schedule 1 relates to landing of whitefish.  It is generally only larger fishing vessels that opt to be invoiced under this charge.</p><p>-  Charge no. 10 of Schedule 1 relates to use of the harbour by passenger boats/vessels and cruise vessels.</p><p>-  Charge no. 17 of Schedule 2 relates to berthing of yachts and pleasure crafts.</p><p>-  Charge 9 takes account of different types of vessel, drawing a distinction as it does between fishing vessels, pelagic vessels and other vessels.  Within this framework, it also differentiates on size, between fishing vessels over and under 6 metres in length overall.</p><p>Waste charges are mandatory on all vessels using a Fishery Harbour Centre whether or not waste is disposed of, as set out in Charge 10 of Schedule 2.  The mandatory nature of the charge arises from national and EU legislative requirements and is also designed to reduce any incentive to discharge waste at sea.  A key principle underpinning this charge is that larger vessels generally tend to generate more waste and are charged more accordingly.  The 2012 Order revoked its 2003 predecessor and while vessels were categorised somewhat differently under the 2003 Order, there has been no increase in the quantum of water or waste charges since then.</p><p>In March 2015, following a complaint the Office of the Ombudsman found no issue with the mandatory nature of these particular charges.</p><p>That said, the Department is currently undertaking an internal review of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates &amp;amp; Charges) Order 2012 (S.I. No. 214 of 2012) , with the intention of introducing a new Order in 2017. It should be noted that Statute requires a full public consultation process to be undertaken before any new Rates and Charges Order is introduced.<table><tr><th>Charge No/ Schedule No </th><th>Description of Facility or Service </th><th>Rate or Charge </th></tr><tr><td>Charge 9/Schedule 1 </td><td>Use of fresh water (mandatory on all vessels using a Fishery Harbour Centre whether or not they use fresh water) other than vessels paying under charge no. 5 and charge no. 10 in this Schedule and charge no. 17 in Schedule 2: <br /><br />(a) fishing vessels (6 metres or more in length overall &mdash; Loa) </td><td><br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />&euro;30 per month per vessel or &euro;2.50 per cubic metre metered</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(b) pelagic vessels <br /><br /></td><td>&euro;90 per month per vessel or &euro;2.50 per cubic metre metered </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(c) all other vessels <br /><br />*Note: If a charge for fresh water is levied at one Fishery Harbour Centre this charge will not be levied in another Fishery Harbour Centre used within that month. </td><td>&euro;2.50 per cubic metre metered <br /><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Charge 10/Schedule 2 </td><td>Disposal of ship generated waste*.

This involves day to day operational support by Harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources.  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;5.9 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2015.</p>  <p>  On the 11th of January I announced funding of &euro;1.45 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre during 2016; in addition I have set aside &euro;420,000 for safety and maintenance, disability access and contractual commitments accruing from 2015.  Significant works in this year&rsquo;s programme include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of pontoons to west pier for ferry landings and traffic management works.</p>  <p>  Of importance in the context of a possible future dredging project at Howth is the allocation of &euro;100,000 for the preparation of a Dumping at Sea Licence which will be required before any dredging project could commence.</p>  <p>  A draft report from a &euro;150,000 site investigation project which was commissioned in 2015 was received in March 2016.  The draft report is being assessed by the Department &rsquo;s engineers.  This report includes vital information on the nature of the material to be dredged in any future dredging project.  This information is necessary for the preparation of the Dumping at Sea licence which will be submitted to the EPA in due course.  Depending on the outcome of this process Dredging Works will be considered subject to available funding.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, including a possible future dredging project at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under future Capital Programmes on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing priorities.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding that, the level of threat from this source is kept under close and constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all appropriate measures will continue to be taken by the authorities here, in co-operation with their international partners, in responding to any identified threats and in seeking to prevent attacks.  There is no complacency in this regard.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the main security threat in the State is from the so-called 'dissident' republican paramilitary groups who continue to be a priority counter-terrorism focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in bearing down on these groups.  The Garda&iacute; and the PSNI deserve praise for their ongoing work in this regard.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units.  All the relevant agencies here cooperate closely in respect of any threats identified.  Where necessary, the considerable skills of the Defence Forces are also available in aid to the civil power.</p>  <p>  The ability to prevent attacks is as important as an ability to deal with such an eventuality.  The gathering of intelligence both domestically and from international sources plays a priority role in ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can perform this task.  The sharing of information and the use of modern information technology structures to support this function is a key priority internationally.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enable them to interact effectively at this level.  This includes connecting to the European Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.</p>  <p>  Increasing the effectiveness of information and intelligence-sharing and enhancing border security have been priority themes at recent meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and they will remain at the top of the agenda for the foreseeable future.  A series of measures is being rolled out to build on and improve current operational co-operation and to develop the EU's legal framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms.  Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p></reply>

In this context, the CCTV Advisory Committee was established to advise on all aspects of CCTV operated for the purpose of increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.

The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation&rsquo;s resource base would best meet public demand.

This is usually in the form of a currently valid passport and may include other original supporting documents, such as a birth certificate and marriage certificate.  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot produce their passport or other supporting documents the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation.  Such explanation should be supported by satisfactory evidence that they have attempted to obtain such documentation and correspondence from the relevant authorities responsible for the issuing of passports in their country, clearly stating the reasons the documentation cannot be provided.  INIS will consider the reasons given and, if satisfied it is for reasons genuinely beyond the applicant's control, may suggest alternative means to the person to assist in establishing their identity and nationality.</p>  <p>  In this particular case, correspondence issued to the person concerned on 29 December 2015 and reminders on 2 March 2016 and 21 March 2016, requesting her national passport or satisfactory explanation from the relevant authorities stating a reason why a passport is unobtainable.  To date, despite two time extensions granted, the applicant has only furnished a photocopy of a birth certificate.  Upon receipt of the requested information, or in the event that the person does not respond, the case will be further processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. I understand from INIS that applications are regularly received from nationals of the country concerned which are supported by appropriate documentation, including passports.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

This is especially the case given the important issues relating to professional misconduct and to the adjudication of legal costs that are concerned.  We also have to manage the transition from the existing statutory, regulatory or other powers currently exercised by the Office of the Taxing-Master and by the  Law Society, the Bar Council and the King's Inns.</p>  <p>  A necessary first step is the appointment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive.  I am happy, therefore, to confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which will have 11 members with a lay majority and a lay Chair, have already been sought from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The appointment of the relevant nominees and Chair under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  At the same time, preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act.  A start-up support team is being established and efforts are already underway to find a suitable premises from which the new Authority can operate.</p>  <p>  These various measures represent the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.  This phase will also include, at the appropriate time, the commencement of other Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.</p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Regulatory Authority, its recruitment of a Chief Executive and such commencements of the Act as take place between now and September, the key remaining Parts of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will then be introduced.  The managed commencement of these critical functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority which will be provided on a recoupable basis.</p></reply>

This forms part of a programme of very considerable ongoing investment in Garda resources which will benefit all policing activities.  I can assure the Deputy that I have no proposals to cut these resources.</p>  <p>  In fact, earlier this year the Government moved decisively to strengthen the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the violent criminals involved in organised criminal gangs through a special ring-fenced additional allocation of &euro;5 million, including steps to establish a dedicated Armed Support Unit in Dublin.  These measures are supporting concentrated policing measures in Dublin City and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are implementing a robust response to violent criminals through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.</p></reply>

This significant investment provides the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles for high-visibility road policing.  Investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis and vehicles are allocated between districts as required by operational circumstances including, for example, when vehicles are required in other districts to substitute for vehicles under repair.</p><p>In that context I am advised by the Garda Authorities that the information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows: <table><tr><th

In this regard the Deputy is aware of the extensive provisions for investments in policing resources which have been put in place since Budget Day 2015.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also appreciate that it would also not be appropriate for me to detail the operational measures that the Garda authorities may take, or would take generally in relation to threats against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities are of course taken.  More generally, tackling serious and organised crime and addressing the harms it gives rise to at all levels in our community is a central policing priority, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has my full support for the strategies it has in place to give effect to this commitment.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is kept under ongoing review, there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p></reply>

The substantial additional investment of &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 will facilitate progress on further important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation.  Examples of the new systems to be developed through this investment include:</p><p>-  new computer-aided dispatch to ensure responsive and coordinated deployment of Garda&iacute; in the community;</p><p>-  mobile technology to give the Garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it;</p><p>-  investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations; and</p><p>-  upgrading the ANPR to  enhance policing of road safety and compliance.</p><p>In the area of forensics, the Garda authorities currently employ highly sophisticated ICT- based fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed measure up to those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also supported by Forensic Science Ireland who provide state of the art services in the area of drug analysis and trace evidence. In addition, the recent launch of the national DNA database will greatly enhance the investigation of crime in Ireland.</p><p>These and other new technological solutions, as well as the investment in resources, will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in responding to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity.</p></reply>

The question of employment rights is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and indeed I understand that the person the subject of the recent ruling referred to by the Deputy was an EU national, who would not need immigration permission to be in Ireland in any event.<br /><br />In the recent case before the Workplace Relations Commission, the position, as I understand it, an individual working as an au pair was deemed to be an employee, with the entitlements that go with that status, including payment of the minimum wage.  While there has traditionally been a social and cultural dimension to work as an au pair, which presumably can continue into the future, this cannot alter the entitlements of individuals deemed to be employees.  This applies irrespective of the immigration arrangements under which they are resident in Ireland.<br /><br />As far as the immigration aspects of this issue are concerned, a non-EEA national would not be granted immigration permission for the  primary purpose of being an au pair and I understand that such employment would not be eligible for an employment permit.  Persons on student permission with an Immigration Stamp 2 are entitled to engage in casual work for 40 hours per week during the months May to August and for a 4 week period from Mid December to Mid January.  Outside that time the limit is 20 hours per week.  Working as an au pair during that time is not forbidden but, as stated above, such work is subject to the various entitlements that employees have.</blockquote></reply>

Since 2012, almost &euro;34 million has been invested in renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses. Over 640 new vehicles are coming on stream since the start of 2015 including new specialised vehicles.  This investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.  The Government is also investing in airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.</p></reply>

In particular, during 2016 we will see a further 600 new Garda&iacute; taking up duty, bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.  There will also be ongoing support for anti-crime measures due to the very significant resources committed in the Capital Plan 2016-2021.  These include an allocation of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community as well as an additional &euro;205 million allocated for Garda technology and ICT systems over the lifetime of the Plan.  These investments are making possible targeted Garda operations, including a concentrated drive against burglary and related crimes under Operation Thor, which has to date involved more than 16,000 anti-crime patrols and in the order of 20,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide.</p><p>I can also assure the Deputy that the legislation to tackle crime has been strengthened, and would mention in particular the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  I am very pleased that this new legislation is now available to support prosecutions arising from the carefully considered Garda strategy to disrupt and oppose criminal activity under Operation Thor.</p></reply>

These children are, by definition, without parents or family in this jurisdiction and Tusla receives them into care on this basis while their applications for asylum are being processed and are referred to as separated children seeking asylum.</p><p>Separated children seeking asylum are placed in the care of the State, with Tusla.  Following a residential assessment, the majority of the children are placed with foster families and Tusla has a dedicated social work team to work with this vulnerable cohort.  A social worker is allocated to each separated child seeking asylum and the social worker has responsibility for the development and implementation of an individualised statutory care plan for the child.  If the social work assessment indicates that making a protection application is in the child&rsquo;s best interest, the social worker assists with the application.  </p><p>The State is duty bound by international and domestic law to protect and provide for separated children in the same way as it does for children normally resident in the State.  In order to provide the same standard of care provision for separated children seeking asylum as any other child in State care, an Equity of Care Principle was introduced in 2010 by the HSE.  Tusla maintains the equity and equality of services to separated children vis-&agrave;-vis other children in State care and ensures there is no differentiation of standard care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.  All foster care organisations and statutory residential centres are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla, against national standards.  The inspection reports are published on the respective websites. </p><p>My Department has a range of systems in place to ensure it is informed of risk to children and families.  Tusla, within its national office, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team.  This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, and includes detailed reporting on key performance indicators.  Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers.  All HIQA and Tusla inspection reports are reviewed and analysed by my Department.  The overview from these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall standard of care and protection capacity of Tusla.  Additional information is gleaned from the National Review Panel reports on individual cases, and also from investigations conducted by the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>Children First (2011) applies to separated children seeking asylum.  Tusla has informed me that it is not aware of any reports of abuse in respect of separated children or young persons seeking asylum while in State care.</p><p>Tusla has also advised that all persons employed full-time or part-time by Tusla are vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a matter of standard practice, as are those employed by the appointed interpretation service.</p><p>The following table shows information on the numbers of separated children seeking asylum and from 2010 to 2015.<table><tr><th>SCSA Referrals</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>Placed in Care</td><td>70</td><td>66</td><td>48</td><td>62</td><td>86</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Total No. of Referrals</td><td>96</td><td>99</td><td>71</td><td>120</td><td>97</td><td>109</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parent(s)/guardian(s).  At the end of December 2015, there were 6,388 children in care in Ireland.  Some 93% (5,932) of these children were cared for in foster placements.  The majority of children are in the care of general foster carers.  At the end of December 2015, some 64% (4,100) of children in care were in a general foster care placement and 29% (1,832) were in foster care with relatives.  </p><p>Key elements of the support to be provided to children in care include: access to a Link Social Worker for supervision and support to the foster carers; allocation of a dedicated Social Worker for children in care; onward referral and advocacy for access to specialist services to meet the child&rsquo;s identified needs, such as speech and language therapy, counselling and psychology services. </p><p>The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to supervise the capacity of the foster carers to adequately meet the needs of the child and to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  At the end of December 2015, 79% (3,277/4,151) of foster carers had a link social worker and 93% (5,492/5,932) of children in foster care had an allocated social worker.  I would also note that Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association which provides additional supports to carers, including training and advice services.</p><p>As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in relation to overall welfare.  I am happy to say that Tusla has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that overall placement stability is very high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.  In addition there are regulations and standards in place for foster and residential placements and there is a regime of regular monitoring and inspections by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  These inspection reports on available on <i>www.hiqa.ie.</i>All 17 areas have been inspected at least once by HIQA, as well as a number of private foster care services.</p><p>All children in care should have an allocated social worker but it is important to note that if a child has not been allocated a social worker, the cases are reviewed regularly by the principal social worker and are managed by duty social work teams to support the child's needs.  Currently, 93% of children in care have an allocated social worker (5,937/6,388).</p><p>In the 2016 Performance Statement, I requested that Tusla make it a priority to strengthen the capacity of its foster care panels, and to ensure sufficient diversity in the numbers of foster carers to provide appropriate matching of carers with children in need of care.  Tusla has committed to increasing the number of approved foster carers over 2016 in its business plan.  The additional funding of &euro;38 million which the Government has allocated to Tusla for 2016, will give the Agency greater capacity to respond to identified demand and to alleviate pressures being faced in areas such as unallocated cases and private residential and foster care.</p></reply>

For the 2016/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, an additional 22,000 from January 2017 and a further 15,500 from April 2017.</p>  <p>  The budgetary announcement in Oct 2015 gave services that wished to expand 11 months notice to plan for the first additional entrants and 18 months to plan for the peak demand in April 2017.  My Department made detailed information available to the City and County Childcare Committees at the beginning of this year indicating the number of children, by every electoral division across the country, who would be eligible for an ECCE place in Sept 2016, January 2017 and April 2017.  My Department continues to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees to match this data against their reported capacity in the sector to meet the increase in demand.  This exercise is almost complete with the City and County Childcare Committees currently producing a national summary and more local data for me on capacity.  Where any capacity issues are found, I will be asking the relevant City/County Childcare Committee to work intensively with my Department to resolve the issue.</p>  <p>  I have launched several initiatives to support capacity building for the ECCE programme, including the Learner Fund 4 which supports staff to upskill and services to have qualified pre-school leaders in their setting.  I have also reformed the rules applying to payment of "Higher Capitation".  The amended rules will allow Higher Capitation to be paid per room, rather than the traditional rule that all pre-school rooms must be led by a graduate to be eligible.  This will allow services who have been in receipt of  Higher Capitation to retain this payment for some of their rooms, even if they do not have a graduate for their additional rooms.</p>  <p>  I have ensured support for capacity building through the Early Years Capital Programme 2016, under which capital funding of &euro;4 million is being made available for pre-school services, including not-for-profit community childcare services, that are making alterations to their services to accommodate the increased numbers resulting from the expansion of the ECCE programme.  The maximum grant available under this programme is &euro;10,000.  The closing date for applications was 8 April 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has, following consultation with officials in my Department, written to all Local Authorities requesting that they assist with the planning process for childcare facilities in order to facilitate the expansion of required capacity.</p></reply>

Using savings from 2015, I was able to announce additional CCS places in late 2015.  Under Budget 2016, I lifted the previous restrictions as part of a major package of strategic investment in affordable, quality and accessible childcare.  The Budget 2016 package included a further &euro;16m investment in the expansion of the CCS Programme, to include its roll-out to private childcare providers, in a targeted manner.</p>  <p>  Delivery of these changes and improvements required significant administrative activity by Pobal and my Department.  Phase 1 of this roll-out, which took effect in October 2015, lifted the expansion restriction within existing CCS services.  Phase 2, announced on 10th November 2015, expanded the CCS Programme to other community/not-for-profit childcare providers not currently under contract to deliver the CCS Programme.  Phase 3, which came into effect recently, saw &euro;16 million in funding for further CCS places made available to private childcare providers (CCS Private).</p>  <p>  Pobal has advised me that 1,657 additional CCS places have been registered as part of Phase 1 and 2 of the expansion as of March 18th, 2016, and that registrations have continued since then.</p>  <p>  The CCS Private programme opened to registrations on Thursday, 14 April last.  To date, some 354 children have registered for CCS funded childcare places with contracted private childcare providers.</p>  <p>  The Department has been working with the City and County Childcare Committees to help promote uptake of the CCS Community and Private expansions across the country.  The CCCs have in turn been working with services within their areas, in particular where they have identified additional need, to communicate the availability of the CCS Programme to parents whose children may be attending their childcare services.</p></reply>

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,</i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.  I welcome the fact that the needs of people moving from congregated settings will be fully taken into account during this process as the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan. </p><p>In terms of housing, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are working in collaboration to support the transition of people with a disability from institutions to social housing in the community under the Government's<i>National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011 to 2016.</i></p><p>The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  This is being supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding from the Department of Health in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE.  In addition I am pleased to note that the Department of the Environment will provide &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  Some &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Environment in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.  This demonstrates the joined up commitment of both Departments to support the de-congregation programme.  </p><p>The HSE has developed a three strand approach to accelerate transitions from institutions in the period 2016-2021, with a target of 900 people to move to more suitable accommodation in this period. </p><p>Strand 1 - is focussed on large institutional settings at high risk of not meeting HIQA Standards;</p><p>Strand 2 - is focussed on moving people into suitable social housing in the community through the Department of Environment schemes; and</p><p>Strand 3 - is focussed on remaining service users in congregated settings who could move to suitable accommodation.</p><p>As the specific information requested in the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE.</p></reply>

Section 30(2) of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides that the PSI Council may make Rules, with the consent of the Minister, to provide further as to what constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist and what may or may not be done by a PA when acting on behalf of a pharmacist.  In 2013, the PSI Council directed that a policy position be developed to enable and facilitate the drafting of rules in line with the requirements of Section 30(2) of the Act and was included in the PSI Service Plan 2014.</p>  <p>  The draft PSI (Regulation of Temporary Absence Cover by Pharmaceutical Assistants) Rules 2016 were developed following debate and engagement with interested parties including the PAA.  </p>  <p>  The draft Rules were issued for consultation on 8 February 2016, ending on 7 March 2016.  The PSI Council considered the matter, including themes arising from the consultation process, at a policy session on the 14 April 2016.  The consideration by the PSI Council is on-going and the PSI will continue to engage with the PAA and other interested parties in doing so.  </p>  <p>  Minister Lynch and I are aware of the concerns of PAs regarding any perceived changes to their employment status and conditions, and Minister Lynch met with a delegation from the PAA in September 2015 to discuss these concerns. </p>  <p>  These draft Rules have yet to be formally submitted to me.  If the PSI Council decides to submit them I will then give consideration to the Rules.</p></reply>

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation. </p>  <p>  Public patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of the country abroad under CBD.  Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways - i.e. patients must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  The CBD excludes certain health services, e.g. services of public health, long term care, organ transplantation, etc.  All persons on public waiting lists, other than for such exempt health services, are eligible for the Scheme.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, whichever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment legislation.</p>  <p>  Each Member State is free to set its own payment policy for cross-border healthcare services; by means of reimbursement to the patient or by direct payment to the healthcare provider.  That policy decision is a matter for each Member State under the Directive and, similar to the majority of Member States, Ireland has no plan to introduce a policy of direct payment to each healthcare service provider, both public and private, in all EU/EEA Member States for healthcare services provided by them.</p></reply>

However the HSE, subject to available funding, under the Treatment Abroad Scheme Travel Policy, may provide assistance towards reasonable economic air or sea travel fares for patients, and a travelling companion where appropriate or where the referring consultant identifies a necessity.  The HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme National Travel Policy was implemented in November 2009 to standardise and provide equity to the provision of entitlements relating to travel expenses.  Expenses other than air/sea fares are not admissible.  However, patients who experience difficulty funding any additional costs may apply to the Department of Social Protection for assistance as an exceptional needs payment.  It should be noted that, in general, patients do not incur subsistence costs when undergoing treatment abroad as such costs are included in the cost of the care that the patient is receiving.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency.  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  Where a medicine is not authorised in Ireland, a licensed wholesaler may import it if it has been prescribed by a doctor for a patient under his/her care, on his/her direct responsibility and in order to meet the special needs of a patient.  The process for this is described in the &lsquo;Guide to the Notification System for Exempt Medicinal Products&rsquo; which is available on the HPRA website.  For this notification scheme, there are a number of specialist wholesalers which deal with the importation of &lsquo;exempt medicines&rsquo; into Ireland, via pharmacies and subject to a prescription.</p>  <p>  CBD is derived from cannabis which is a controlled drug.  If a CBD oil product does not contain an ingredient which is a controlled substance, it may be feasible to have that product imported and used in Ireland, in accordance with specific conditions, should a patient&rsquo;s doctor be of the opinion that this is an appropriate treatment.</p></reply>

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction in 2010.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.</p></reply>

The drug was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency in November 2015.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe.</p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval.  The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.</p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been completed.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being sought by the manufacturer.  The Minister for Health has requested that the NCPE expedite this part of the process.  The Centre hopes to be in a position to issue its recommendation to the HSE in early June, and the HSE may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer.</p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco (ivacaftor), new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.</p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.</p></reply>

This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada.  Notwithstanding this, recruitment of additional nurses to support service delivery has been a priority for the HSE in the past two years as it has been possible to increase health funding.  Consequently, the total number of nurses employed in the public service has increased by over 1,200 from 34,617 in February 2014 to 35,846 in February 2016 (WTE's).</p>  <p>  Following engagement between the relevant parties under the terms of a 'Chairman's Note' to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, a joint document was agreed by the HSE, the nursing unions and my Department that provided for consideration of an increase in the pay rates for fourth year student nurses undertaking the 36 week clinical placement.  I am pleased that it has been possible with effect from 1 March 2016 to significantly improve the rate of pay for fourth year student nurses during their clinical placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse scale.  Recognition for the duration of the placement as public service for incremental credit purposes has also been restored for future graduates.</p></reply>

In addition, the HSE has been advised that a further sum of &euro;58.5 million is being held back by the Department for specific initiatives as outlined in the 2016 National Service Plan.  This includes &euro;8 million for initiatives in therapy services for young people.  The two initiatives are the continued implementation of the Progressing Disabilities Services Programme, including development of early intervention services to facilitate the integration of children with disabilities in mainstream preschool settings (&euro;4 million), and a primary care speech and language waiting-list initiative (&euro;4million).  </p>  <p>  Detailed plans for both of these initiatives have been received by my Department and are under active consideration.  Once these plans are agreed, it is expected that my Department will fund the costs as required.  As noted in the HSE service plan, the HSE anticipates generating &euro;20m in time related saving on a once off basis from the initiatives totalling &euro;58.5m.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of mental health services, including early intervention and counselling, children's mental health services and the enhancement of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.  It is expected that a decision on these proposals will be made shortly.  Some of these proposals for the &euro;35m allocation for mental health involve the recruitment of extra staff for new service developments. </p>  <p>  As staff recruitment takes time, the Service Plan provides that time related savings from these and other planned initiatives in the areas set out above, on a once-off basis, would be used to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds, and for vaccine procurement, but not for hospitals, acute services, or to address waiting lists.  As the initiatives planned for mental health are approved, arrangements will be made for the release of funding, having regard to the overall Service Plan provisions outlined above.</p></reply>

It will allow integration and improve patient flow across the continuum of care.  The reconfiguration of services across acute hospitals will facilitate the safe management of the majority of patients, who require only a routine, straightforward level of urgent or planned care, locally and the minority of patients, who require major emergency or more complex planned care, to be treated safely in acute regional or national centres where all the relevant specialist clinical expertise is available.</p>  <p>  Any future investment in respect of Cavan/Monaghan Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme and establishment of hospital groups.  Each hospital group, including the RCSI Hospital Group of which Cavan/Monaghan Hospital is a member, will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves.</p></reply>

One of the key challenges for our health system is ensuring timely access to health services.  Both my Department and the HSE recognise that there are resource availability and structural challenges which impact on individual specialties and hospital sites.  Therefore, it is vital to effectively manage waiting lists so that those patients longest waiting are scheduled within the available capacity, once emergency and urgent cases have been dealt with.  The HSE National Service Plan sets target key performance indicators for waiting lists so that adults and children receive necessary scheduled care within a timely fashion. </p><p>This year, the HSE will focus on a number of activities to manage patient waiting times, including:</p><p>- ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to;</p><p>- putting in place administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment;</p><p>- relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals;</p><p>- outsourcing a percentage of patients where there is limited capacity to treat them in the public system; and</p><p>- designating an improvement lead for each hospital group, to provide support in meeting national targets for appointments and treatment.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The Group has been overseeing initiatives to address ED overcrowding and ED performance, particularly over this peak winter period. </p>  <p>  During 2015, additional funding of &euro;117 million was provided to the HSE to relieve ED overcrowding pressures.  This funding has supported initiatives to expand hospital capacity with 362 additional beds opened or reopened, reduce the number of hospital attendances by expanding community intervention team services and increasing the availability of community hospitals, and support timely patient discharge from hospital by reducing the wait time for Fair Deal funding to no more than 4 weeks, providing additional transitional care places, public community beds and home care packages. </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of 2016, the HSE has reported an increase in emergency department (ED) activity in comparison with the same period last year.  Overall, there has been an increase of 6.9% in patient attendances.  Despite sustained increase in attendances, the total year to date number of patients waiting on trolleys at 8am each morning shows a marginal increase of 1%.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the expected surge in demand for emergency care, which usually arises around the Easter period, Hospital Groups in conjunction with Community Healthcare Organisations put in place preparedness plans for the holiday period.  Measures implemented included optimising discharges in advance of the weekends, strengthening the senior decision making presence at wards and in Emergency Departments, increased diagnostics at the weekends and securing staff to open overflow areas.  As a result of these measures, the ED performance over the Easter period was favourable compared with 2015.</p></reply>

In January 2015, I put in place maximum permissible waiting times for inpatient and day case treatment and outpatient appointments of 18 months by 30 Jun 2015 and 15 months by year end.  The HSE was provided with additional funding of &euro;51m to ensure that these maximum waiting times would be achieved by maximising capacity across public and voluntary hospitals as well as outsourcing activity where the capacity is not available to meet patient needs. HSE figures for end December 2015 show positive progress against the 15 months maximum wait time.  For in-patient and day case waiting lists, overall performance equates to 95% achievement of the 15 month maximum permissible wait time and for outpatient waiting lists, overall performance equates to 93% achievement of the 15 month maximum permissible wait time.</p><p>This year, the HSE will focus on a number of activities to manage patient waiting times, including:</p><p>- ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to;</p><p>- putting in place administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment;</p><p>- relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals;</p><p>- outsourcing a percentage of patients where there is limited capacity to treat them in the public system; and</p><p>- designating an improvement lead for each hospital group, to provide support in meeting national targets for appointments and treatment.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s core view &ndash; which I believe enjoys wide consensus in Ireland &ndash; is that we want the UK to remain a member of the EU.</p>  <p>  Within the context of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing work on this issue, I travelled to London on 5 April for a visit that encompassed a meeting with UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, contacts with the opposition Labour Party, meetings with leading members of the Irish Community and engagement with the Irish community media in the UK.  I also met last week with a cross-section of Irish employers and business groups to hear their views on the referendum and to hear what actions they were taking.</p>  <p>  My Department, through its diplomatic staff in Dublin, across Britain and Northern Ireland, in Brussels and further afield, continues to work actively on this issue and to contribute to wider Government efforts coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  An important focus of my visit to London on 5 April was to meet members of the Irish community and to engage with Irish community media in the UK.  I met with over 30 Irish community and business organisations and encouraged them to inform and involve their members, most of whom as Irish citizens resident in the UK are eligible to vote in this referendum.  According to the 2011 Census for England and Wales and the 2011 Census for Scotland, there are 601,917 people born on the island of Ireland resident in Britain, while it is also estimated that up to one in four people in Britain may have Irish heritage.</p>  <p>  Some leading individuals in the Irish community have also come together to form an independent campaign group, Irish4Europe, and I met with them to hear of their plans for the coming weeks in the run-up to the referendum on 23 June. </p>  <p>  During my meeting with the Foreign Secretary, I recalled that the Irish Government had been very active in helping to secure a settlement on the UK&rsquo;s EU membership at the February European Council.  I also reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s clear view in support of the UK Government&rsquo;s wish for the UK to remain in the EU. </p>  <p>  I meet regularly with my EU counterparts at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and use every opportunity to raise the issue of the EU-UK relationship with them, and to outline Ireland's perspective and the need to work together with a view to helping to keep the UK in the EU.  This all contributed to the work of EU Heads of State and Government at the European Council, and by Ministers at the General Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  I and my officials also discuss the matter with the Northern Ireland Parties and with civic society groups, in particular underlining our view that EU has made &ndash; and continues to make &ndash; a significant contribution to the promotion of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The British Embassy has estimated that approximately 120,000 British citizens living in Ireland will be eligible to vote and I welcome and support the active outreach efforts undertaken by the Embassy in encouraging their citizens living here to register and vote in this referendum.  It is hoped that the regular statements by government and by other political, civil society, media and economic commentators will help to inform their vote.</p>  <p>  Determining the full implications for Ireland of a British withdrawal from the EU &ndash; should it occur - is not possible without knowing the terms and conditions of its future relationship with the EU, which would take a number of years to negotiate. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Government is of course evaluating the potential impacts of a possible British exit from the EU and the steps which may be necessary to mitigate against the risks arising from this.  The ESRI has also conducted research on this issue, as have others including the Central Bank, the NTMA, Teagasc and IBEC. </p></reply>

An application may take longer to process for a number of reasons.  For example if the application form is completed incorrectly, the required supporting documentation is not provided or if the level of demand is exceptionally high.</p>  <p>  Throughout this year the demand for passports has been exceptionally high.  From 1 January to 18 April the Passport Service has received a total of 257,598 applications for passport books and 7,408 for passport cards.  This represents a significant increase of 14.3% in applications for passport books compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  To address the anticipated increase over the summer season, the Passport Service has recruited additional Temporary Clerical Officers who will work a total of 5,122 weeks this year.  In view of the sustained increase over last year&rsquo;s levels, application processing work has been redistributed across passport offices in recent weeks and staff re-deployed from other areas of the Department as needed to respond to the increased workload. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the turnaround times which are advised, including those for the An Post Passport Express service, are not a stated guarantee.  </p>  <p>  I strongly recommend therefore that citizens apply for passports at least six weeks in advance of any planned travel and take special care to ensure that application forms are correctly completed before submission.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation. </p></reply>

Critically, it should stop people getting into unsafe boats and risking their lives.    The agreement complies with international law on the protection of human rights. All migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant international standards and in respect of the principle of non-refoulement. This includes a guarantee that any migrants / refugees arriving in the Greek islands who wish to claim asylum will have their applications processed individually by the Greek authorities in accordance with the Asylum Procedures Directive, in cooperation with UNHCR.</p>  <p>  The need to comply with international law was at the heart of the March European Council discussions.

I condemned this brutal murder in the House on 17 December 2015.  Mr El&ccedil;i was a strong and principled proponent of an end to the current violence and a return to the peace process and, as a human rights lawyer, he was critical of human rights abuses on all sides of the conflict.    The need for swift and transparent investigations into acts of terrorism has also been emphasised by the EU.  I stated at that time of Mr El&ccedil;i&rsquo;s murder that a full investigation would be important.

The brutal activities of Boko Haram continue to represent a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria, and to the wider region, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The abduction in April 2014 of the schoolgirls from Chibok appalled the world. This attack was one of a number perpetrated on defenceless young people, seeking to destroy their education and their futures.    Ireland, together with our EU partners, continues to call on all parties to work for the release of the more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok who remain in captivity.  We are aware that a video has been released in recent days, from which family members and friends are said to have identified some of the girls.  </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the Nigerian Government to create a secure environment in which the human rights of civilians are promoted and protected, including in those areas affected by Boko Haram. </p>  <p>  The Nigerian Government has seen some recent successes in tackling Boko Haram and regaining control of territory.  At an EU-Nigeria Ministerial dialogue last month, the EU urged the Nigerian Government to continue these efforts and to ensure full operationalisation of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, to which Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are contributing a total of 8,700 troops.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided humanitarian relief to those affected by Boko Haram attacks. In March 2015, we arranged for the airlift of 87 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies for distribution by the NGO Plan to an estimated 13,000 Nigerian refugees in Cameroon. In October last year, we provided &euro;500,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC) for its humanitarian operations in Nigeria. In addition, one of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Responders is currently working with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in northern Nigeria.</p>  <p>  We are continuing to monitor the situation closely through our Embassy in Abuja and through the EU. Our Ambassador to Nigeria travelled to Borno State, the region in the North East particularly affected by Boko Haram activities, last December, where he met with the Governor. </p>  <p>The EU has pledged up to &euro;50 million in support for the Multinational Joint Taskforce to tackle Boko Haram, and, in June 2015, announced &euro;21 million in humanitarian funding to the four countries concerned.  The EU has also funded technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor of Nigeria to support the implementation of counter-terrorism legislation and capacity to tackle radicalisation.</p></reply>

I would like to reiterate the serious concern I have expressed several times already in this House at the escalation of violence since the breakdown of the ceasefire between the Turkish Government and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last summer. This breakdown has been all the more regrettable given that there were positive signs in the peace process as recently as early 2015. Ireland has been a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK. The current situation demonstrates clearly the critical importance for all sides to cease hostilities and return to dialogue. The most recent Progress Report on Turkey, published in November 2015, stated that &lsquo;It is   imperative to resume the Kurdish peace process as a matter of urgency.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The Government also remains concerned at the broader situation of fundamental freedoms in Turkey, particularly with regard to freedom of expression and the media. The rule of law and human rights are, of course, an integral part of the Enlargement process and were highlighted in the most recent Progress Report on Turkey. Ireland, along with the EU, will continue its dialogue with Turkey on these important issues to address the &lsquo;significant backsliding in the areas of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly&rsquo; identified in the 2015 Progress Report. </p>  <p>  The issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at the European Council. The situation of the Kurds, of course, arises not just in the context of their situation in Turkey, but also in the context of the war in Syria and the situation in Iraq, both of which are discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, both at headquarters in Dublin and in our Embassy in Ankara, will continue to follow developments in Turkey very closely.</p></reply>

However, religious leaders have condemned such actions as not in accordance with religious beliefs.  We must continue to make this distinction: the threat is posed not by religious belief, but by terrorist groups. The Minister for Justice and Equality takes the lead role in assessing and responding to the threat to national security posed by international terrorism.  The Minster has stated that there is no specific information concerning any threat to Ireland, and that the level of threat is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   Appalling attacks over the past year in France, Lebanon, Mali, Turkey and elsewhere have served to remind us that terrorism does not respect borders.  The recent horrific attacks in Brussels have demonstrated once again that the potential for terrorist attacks is heightened by European citizens returning from areas of conflict.  Accordingly, while member states have the primary responsibility for addressing terrorism, an effective response requires international cooperation.</p>  <p>  At EU level, external action to prevent and counter terrorism has been discussed regularly by the Foreign Affairs Council.  An EU Counter Terrorism Strategy for Syria and Iraq, was approved by the FAC in October 2014 and an outline of this was subsequently made public.</p>  <p>  Further discussions took place at the FAC in January and February 2015.  At our 9 February meeting we reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for swift implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  We highlighted the need to step up EU external action and to that end, agreed to pursue initiatives in five broad areas.  These concerned strengthening partnerships with key countries in the Middle East and North Africa and with regional bodies such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation; supporting capacity building in those countries; countering radicalisation and violent extremism; active engagement with international partners and organisations; and addressing underlying factors and crises.</p>  <p>  Under the heading of countering radicalisation and violent extremism we welcomed initiatives to facilitate interfaith dialogue, we invited the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to continue efforts to defend and advocate freedom of expression, religion and belief particularly in the MENA region, and we agreed that the EU would continue to work with faith-based organisations.</p>  <p>  Our discussions and conclusions fed into a meeting of the informal European Council on 12 February.  This meeting also took account of work undertaken by EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers to promote EU internal security. Heads of State and Government set out an agenda for action for 2015 on internal and external EU action.  This detailed guidance included a focus on promotion of tolerance, non-discrimination, fundamental freedoms and solidarity, including stepping up inter-faith and other dialogue, and promoting narratives to counter terrorist ideologies.</p>  <p>  Work on these various strands continued throughout 2015.  The December Foreign Affairs Council reviewed progress in implementing the measures agreed at our February 2015 meeting.  Progress was achieved in a wide range of areas, supported through the provision of substantially increased funding for counter terrorism activities in third countries.  Some &euro;142 million was allocated in 2015 compared to just &euro;10 million four years previously.  A comprehensive package of assistance has been put in place for Tunisia and it is hoped that this will lead to similar packages for other countries in 2016.</p>  <p>  Counter terrorism experts were appointed in 2015 to a number of EU delegations in the MENA region, Turkey and Nigeria to work closely with the host countries to tackle the terrorist threat.  We also strengthened cooperation with international partners including the UN, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.  We agreed on the need to step up our efforts in 2016 and that priority should continue to be given to counter terrorism cooperation in the MENA region, Turkey and the Western Balkans.</p>  <p>  The FAC will keep the effectiveness of EU external action under review throughout 2016.  I expect that there will be a continuing focus on the need to promote political solutions to the underlying crises; the importance of continuing the EU&rsquo;s support for work on counter-radicalisation; and stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, funding and weapons in Syria, Iraq and more widely in the region in line with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.</p></reply>

Our policy commitments are reflected in The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World which recognises the impacts of climate change on weather and ecosystems and the adverse effects particularly on the poorest people in least developed countries.  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development, One World, One Future includes climate change and development as one of the seven priority areas of action under the development programme. At the 21st   UN Framework C Convention on Climate Change held in Paris in December 2015, the Taoiseach committed Ireland to continuing our support to developing countries in areas such as climate justice and in supporting vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change. For 2016, the Government has provided a gross allocation to Official Development Assistance of &euro;641 million.  &euro;486 million of this is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Irish Aid programme.  During 2016, Ireland will continue to integrate climate change adaptation strategies into relevant development cooperation programmes.

We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination and incitement to religious hatred. With our EU partners, we consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council.  Our approach is informed by the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion adopted during Ireland's EU Presidency in 2013 and by the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-19 which, at Ireland's instigation, includes a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief.External action to prevent and counter terrorism has been discussed regularly by the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  An EU Counter Terrorism Strategy for Syria and Iraq, was approved by the FAC in October 2014 and an outline of this was subsequently made public.</p><p>Further discussions took place at the FAC in January and February 2015.  At our 9 February meeting we reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for swift implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards.  We highlighted the need to step up EU external action and to that end, agreed to pursue initiatives in five broad areas.  These concerned strengthening partnerships with key countries in the Middle East and North Africa and with regional bodies such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation; supporting capacity building in those countries; countering radicalisation and violent extremism; active engagement with international partners and organisations; and addressing underlying factors and crises.  We must address these underlying causes and through diplomacy seek to resolve the crises that contribute to the terrorism threat.  In the absence of comprehensive political solutions, our efforts to combat terrorism will be in vain.</p><p>EU Foreign Ministers have welcomed initiatives to facilitate interfaith dialogue, have invited the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to continue efforts to defend and advocate freedom of expression, religion and belief particularly in the MENA region, and we have agreed that the EU will continue to work with faith-based organisations.</p><p>During the past year, Ireland has reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief on many occasions.  I highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York in October 2015 and during my meeting with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in May 2015.  At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015, Ireland made a number of statements in which we condemned DA&rsquo;ESH&rsquo;S barbarous treatment of civilians, their campaign of violence against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq, and their treatment of women and girls, including their being subjected to harrowing acts of sexual and physical violence and to sexual slavery.  Ireland also delivered a statement addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief during an interactive dialogue at the thirty-first session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2016.<font color="#004080">  </font>Ireland will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians through its engagement at the United Nations and as part of EU efforts to support and promote freedom of religion or belief.</p></reply>

Governments and citizens across Europe continue to hold broadly positive views on the European union. The EU, and Ireland as a Member State, engages with the big issues of the day, whether they relate to stability, jobs and growth, or to challenges external and internal, such as migration and international terrorism.  It is important to continue to engage with these issues at the EU-level if we are serious about addressing them.  Equally, our Union&rsquo;s positive image depends to a large degree on its ability to respond to these challenges in a way that commands public confidence.   We must work both to ensure that the EU does its own work better and that it is better communicated to the public.  The Government has worked closely with the EU Institutions and our fellow Member States to put the citizen at the heart of the EU agenda for sustainable investment, growth and job creation.</p>  <p>  The Juncker Commission has strengthened engagement with the public and is making good on its commitment to develop a Commission which is &lsquo;&rsquo;more ambitious on big things and more modest on little things&rsquo;&rsquo;, thus ensuring a focus on the areas where the EU can deliver value and allowing other matters to be regulated at the national level.</p></reply>

This remains the core issue in the conflict and no sustainable peace can be achieved without agreement on political change in Syria.  The cessation of hostilities remains critical to the negotiations.  There can be no prospect of meaningful negotiations if the violence continues.  The reports of Assad regime helicopters barrel bombing opposition held areas underline the urgent need for a comprehensive political solution.  I note the concerns expressed by the opposition that the Assad regime is seeking to undermine the negotiations by its ceaseless campaign of violence against civilians.   I call on all parties, including all members of the International Syria Support Group, to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work sincerely and with urgency for a nationwide ceasefire, a negotiated peace agreement which will protect the rights of the Syrian people and preserve the pluralistic character, unity and sovereignty of a free and democratic Syria at peace.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles and UN Security Council Resolution 2254, in particular the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.</p>  <p>  I believe that there must also be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict and in 2014 we co-sponsored a resolution called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry has reported that the Assad regime is responsible for the majority of crimes against the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  While recognising the need for a political transition and an end to the Assad regime, I want to make clear that it is the Syrian people&rsquo;s right to decide on Syria&rsquo;s future national leadership.</p></reply>

The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the new Digital Strategy for schools and the Department will collaborate with DCENR to provide enhanced broadband to all primary schools. </p><p>  Under the Schools Broadband Access Programme the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for recognised primary and post primary schools.  A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2012 which has ensured improved solutions are available to schools.  The most recent drawdown of the framework last September had approximately 90% of school connections retendered, including the school referred to by the Deputy.  These awards have seen over 1,100 schools awarded connections of 30Mbit/s or greater, approximately 400 of these connections have been installed to date and the remainder will be installed in the coming months. </p><p>  In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, the provider awarded has been unable to provide the broadband service as anticipated, and so the Department will re-award this school to the next most appropriate provider.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and this is impacting the service that can be provided to this school.</p><p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises.</p></reply>

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.</p>  <p>  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.</p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally -  were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.</p>  <p>  Maintaining the high quality of our education system and the teaching profession is a key concern of the Government.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.</p></reply>

This measure applied also to stand alone schools on the islands </p>  <p>  Within limited resources, there was a limit to the overall number of teachers that could be funded in the recent budget;  it was not possible to go beyond that point, but it is clearly open to a new Government within the next budget to apply the same measure to all other small remote schools.</p>  <p>  For the 2015/16 school year there are 33 single teacher schools of which 5 are on the islands.

A key indicator in relation to these schools is a significant increase in junior infants enrolments.  It is envisaged that these schools will typically be in areas of significant population growth.</p>  <p>  Schools appealing under this criterion must meet four requirements in order to be eligible to appeal.

Although children are not obliged to attend school until the age of six, most children begin school in the September following their fourth birthday.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. This enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary and this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that during 2015 a total of 143 appeals against refusal to enrol decisions by primary schools were taken; 67 of which were withdrawn or resolved before the formal hearing; 29 of which were upheld and 47 of which were not upheld.</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme has been developed specifically for local authority mortgage borrowers, as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) arrangements which operates in local authorities.  The scheme was piloted in Dublin City and Westmeath County Councils in 2013 and rolled out nationally in 2014.  In total, 193 LAMTR cases have been completed to date, 7 of which were in Laois and 6 in Kildare, with a significant number of other cases being progressed by local authorities in the context of their operation of the MARP.</p><p>The LAMTR scheme is similar to the scheme for borrowers with mortgages from private commercial lending institutions, insofar as it also targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Further information on the LAMTR scheme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>Both schemes also ensure that the family remains in their home.  In the case of LAMTR, ownership of the home is transferred to a local authority, rather than to an Approved Housing Body (AHB) as is the case under the MTR scheme in the private lending sector. Both schemes require the household to be eligible for social housing in order to access to the scheme.</p><p>My Department does not have access to information relating to the number of borrowers who have been offered the Mortgage to Rent Scheme by their specific private lending institution.  The lender is the main point of contact for the borrower in terms of the operation of the scheme - only lenders can put an application forward for the scheme.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) can advise borrowers in mortgage distress how to access the Scheme, but it is up to the lender to offer the borrower access to it.</p><p>According to the latest figures available, at the end of February 2016, a total of 785 cases were either complete or being actively progressed under the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions; 27 of these were in Laois, with 64 in Kildare.  Of these, 150 cases had completed all stages of the process. In total, since the introduction of the Scheme in 2012, 3,256 cases had been submitted; 93 of these were in Laois, with 210 in Kildare.  There are a variety of reasons why cases have not progressed including the householder&rsquo;s circumstances improving during the process, no social housing demand in the area, the householder&rsquo;s income being in excess of the statutory limits for eligibility for social housing, and poor condition of the property.  My Department continues to work together with the agencies involved with the Scheme, including lenders, to streamline the administrative process and ensure that all potential cases are dealt with speedily and efficiently.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of both Mortgage to Rent schemes under review.</p></reply>

The Dublin Region Homelessness Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 has increased the funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;47.7 million in 2016, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of an additional 10,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2016.  The majority of this funding is to support on-going rent payments to landlords in respect of existing HAP households and the cost of additional HAP tenancies as households find accommodation through the scheme during the year.</p>  <p>  The primary administrative support to HAP local authorities is the central transactional shared service being provided by Limerick City and County Council to all local authorities operating the HAP scheme.  This shared service is responsible for a range of functions including monthly payments to landlords and the collection of weekly differential rent from tenants and provides a range of efficiencies to the operation of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Each Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  My Department works closely with all local authorities and all have been invited to submit staffing sanction requests to facilitate the delivery of the Social Housing Strategy.  Each staffing sanction request is examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints.  To date 55 HAP related posts have been sanctioned by my Department in response to staffing requests from HAP local authorities and the shared service centre provided by Limerick City and County Council.</p>  <p>  In order to cover staffing and administrative costs arising due to the operation of the HAP scheme in their area, local authorities are provided with an administrative payment of &euro;150 per household supported as they are set up under the HAP scheme.  In 2015, some &euro;993,000 was paid by my Department in such HAP administration costs to local authorities.  Local authorities will be able to make claims on a similar basis for 2016.</p>  <p>  The phased roll out of the HAP pilot scheme has proved to be an effective approach.  In this context, my Department maintains regular contact with the pilot local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise.</p></reply>

However, in 2014, in recognition of the need to address a build-up of vacant social houses, my Department introduced the current programme to support local authorities to return vacant social houses to productive use, with exchequer funding provided since then for some 5,000 such housing units at a cost of almost &euro;60 million.

This facilitates local authorities to forward design proposals and costings to my Department sequentially, as they are advanced through the authorities&rsquo; planning work.

The 2013 figures are the most up-to-date figures available on waiting list numbers, which are subject to on-going fluctuation as households are allocated housing and new households are added to the lists.  The full 2013 results are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>In order to ensure that the most up to date and comprehensive data is available, on an on-going basis, relating to the numbers applying for social housing support, the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020 , includes a number of actions to standardise assessment and increase the regularity of assessments including undertaking the summary of social housing assessments on an annual basis from 2016 onwards.</p><p>Ultimately, a shortage of supply is at the heart of the challenges in the broader housingand residential sector.  Where the estimated requirement is for 25,000 new units per annum the construction sector is currently delivering around half that.  The supply issue is putting upward pressure on rents which in turn can push vulnerable households into emergency accommodation. </p><p>A number of important measures have been taken to improve housing viability and increase supply, through the actions set out in Construction 2020 and the Social Housing Strategy 2020.Laying the Foundations: Housing Actions Report, which was published on 14 April 2016, provides information on thirty-one major actions taken across the housing spectrum since mid-2014 to increase the supply of all forms of housing.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>One of the key actions involved introducing measures to protect tenants&rsquo; rights and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, introduced a number of measures to address rent stability and significantly strengthen the rights of tenants.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol currently operates in Cork and Dublin in conjunction with a local authority funded tenancy protection service, provided through the non-governmental organisation Threshold.  Under these arrangements, Threshold provides advice and advocacy for tenants who are at risk of losing their homes.  When necessary, Threshold may refer the case directly to the Department of Social Protection and that Department may apply a discretionary uplift to Rent Supplement rates, thereby securing the continuation of the tenancy. </p><p>While the protocol arrangements are currently only operational in Cork and Dublin, the Department of Social Protection continues to exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis for Rent Supplement clients nationwide under its National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under both Tenancy Sustainment arrangements, uplifts have been granted at the discretion of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Welfare Officers to approximately 7,500 clients nationwide, with approximately 5,000 of these in the Dublin Region. Operational issues in this regard are a matter for the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>With regard to the supply of social housing in particular , the Social Housing Strategy 2020includes targets and actions to increase the supply of social housing by 110,000 additional units.  The report, Social Housing Output in 2015 , which I published on 26 January 2016, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>While I am satisfied that a solid foundation has been laid to ensure that the challenges in housing can be overcome, it will take an on-going and increased commitment from all stakeholders to deal with the issues comprehensively.</p></reply>

In relation to projects my Department has approved, these follow on from the announcement I made in April last year of over &euro;1.5 billion in funding allocations in respect of social housing to be provided by all local authorities via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.  Those allocations and associated targets for each local authority, including Kildare, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>Following this notification of targets, I made announcements of substantial new social housing projects in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016.  Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions. Details of these project approvals, including those for Kildare, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>.</i></p><p>I am keen that all local authorities, including Kildare County Council, advance these projects as soon as possible and I have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard.  While social housing construction projects are being advanced, acquisitions of new and second-hand houses and apartments remain an effective means of meeting immediate social housing need.  In 2015, Kildare County Council secured the purchase of 79 housing units and to date this year, have completed the purchases of a further 25 additional units for social housing purposes.  Some of these acquisitions, as well as some of the approved construction projects, were under the Capital Assistance Scheme whereby approved housing bodies (AHBs) deliver social housing for those with specific needs such as elderly people, persons with intellectual or physical disability and homeless persons.  </p><p>Under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), my Department, together with local authorities, can support AHBs to construct, purchase or lease housing units and make them available for social housing.  The housing units are secured under long-term leases/availability arrangements between local authorities, AHBs and private property owners.  A total of 30 social housing units were delivered under the Programme in the administrative area of Kildare County Council in 2015.  To date, a total of 157 units have received funding approval under the Programme and will be delivered in Kildare over the course of the next two years.  124 of these are new units that will be purchased by AHBs with assistance from the Department&rsquo;s Capital Advance Leasing Facility and made available to Kildare County Council under long-term lease arrangements funded by SHCEP. </p><p>Information on all social housing outputs is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. </p>  <p>  In October 2015, the Government approved a programme to deliver 500 units of rapid-delivery housing across the Dublin Region for homeless families currently in commercial hotels. An initial 22 units are being delivered in Poppintree, Ballymun. In November 2015, Dublin City Council entered into a contract for the delivery of the 22 units in Ballymun at a cost of &euro;4.2m excluding VAT. This is the original tender cost and remains the approved cost, equating to approximately &euro;191,000 excluding VAT per unit. While a wide range of possible costs were suggested by various parties outside the tender process , including at the time that a variety of modular-type units were demonstrated in September 2015, it is only through the tender process , on the basis of a clear specification for high quality units, that a definitive project cost is established. The average cost of these units   must be considered in the context of their early delivery and the quality involved.   </p>  <p>  This programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless households accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. The units will provide accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services. The temporary assignment of these units to homeless households, and the duration of occupancy by them, is a matter for housing authorities.   </p></reply>

This bye-law is being sought to regulate a historical fishery management rule that is in place on Lough Sheelin.  The fishery management rule currently in place prohibits fishing for any species by rod and line from 13 October to the end of February. There is no change in practice regarding this and regulating this rule under legislation ensures that it can be enforced more effectively. Fishing for all species has always been allowed during the open season from 1 March to 12 October on Lough Sheelin. These regulations have been in place for twenty years during the tenure of the then Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. This has been a widely recognised status for the lake and promoted through the angling guide leaflets and signage erected at Lough Sheelin.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. On 29 September 2015, the Government agreed and published its 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery</i>, which included an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan. This will provide the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available over the lifetime of any contract(s). </p><p>Funding of &euro;75m is also committed through the European Regional Development Fund which can be drawn down after Exchequer expenditure is first incurred.</p><p>On 22 December 2015, I formally launched a major Government procurement process for the State intervention to deliver a high quality high speed broadband infrastructure to over 750,000 premises in Ireland. The formal procurement process commenced with the publication of the Pre-qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum. Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of noon, 31 March 2016. </p><p>The five responses are now being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to short listed qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.</p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation, which follows the ITPD process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder or bidders will be selected for the two lots / one lot as set out in the Intervention Strategy document. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). </p><p>The Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand. All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network rollout and will be agreed during the procurement process.</p><p>Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the rollout in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of all premises in Ireland (both commercial and intervention area) will have access to high speed broadband within two years of the contract award, with 100% of premises connected within 5 years. </p><p>Because a competitive procurement process is currently in train, it would be neither advisable nor appropriate to speculate about the potential overall cost of the NBP at this stage. Ultimately, the outcome of the procurement process will determine the final cost of the intervention and will influence the amount of Exchequer funding that will be required for the NBP.</p></reply>

Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March.

The procurement process is underway and it is proposed to engage with the winning bidder(s) in due course on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand. All these factors will need to be balanced against the most efficient network rollout and will be agreed during the procurement process.</p><p>The Department has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders and communities in developing the Intervention Strategy, conducting four formal consultations and over 100 meetings over the last 18 months in particular. Engagement with industry stakeholders as part of the pre-procurement consultations has indicated that the rollout in the Amber area could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award. In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of all premises in Ireland (both commercial and intervention area) will have access to high speed broadband within two years of the contract award, with 100% of premises connected within 5 years. </p><p>Local communities, and in particular, Local Authorities have an important role to play in facilitating the efficient rollout of infrastructure in their areas.

The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER. The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER represent the target areas for the proposed State intervention. Members of the public can view whether their premises is in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode. </p><p>The Intervention Strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. </p><p>The intention is to build out the network in the AMBER area as quickly as possible. The Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) on the optimum rollout strategy, and on the sequencing of the network deployment to maximise efficiencies during network build, having regard to business and consumer needs, and to areas of particularly poor service and areas of strong demand.

These are providing a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities over previous 3G and 2G technologies. These 4G networks use the same technology as the most modern mobile networks providing public access internationally.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) which is an independent regulator. The CER was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 and subsequent legislation. It is therefore a function of the CER to regulate the electricity market. The way a supplier presents information on a customer&rsquo;s bill is a matter for the CER under the regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  The Standing charge is a combination of the fixed charges associated with providing electricity network services (e.g. meter reading and network operations/maintenance) and a share of the supply costs in servicing customers&rsquo; electricity accounts. Standing charges vary from supplier to supplier and will be presented by the supplier under one of four classes of standing charges: Urban 24hr, Urban Nightsaver, Rural 24hr, Rural Nightsaver. Which class a customer falls under depends on meter type (whether 24hr or Nightsaver) and location, and for the latter, whether the urban or rural class applies depends on the location of the customer&rsquo;s property.</p></reply>

The maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant landowner.  The LIS for regional and local roads remains in place but my Department does not provide a separate grant allocation towards this scheme.  Instead Councils may use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  It is a matter for the Council to decide on allocations for LIS.  Regarding Budget 2017, it will be a matter for the incoming Government when it is formed to determine the Exchequer provision for roads (including regional and local roads) in 2017.</p></reply>

As explained previously, decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport. Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the period of the plan and the bulk of the roads capital, over &euro;4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.</p>  <p>  In this context the Ardee bypass was one of the projects that it was not possible to include given the overall funding envelope available.  Over the period of the Capital Plan funding for land transport, including roads, will be built up towards the levels needed to support adequate maintenance and development.</p></reply>

The specific objective under which this application will be considered is the promotion of cross-border intermodal and sustainable mobility in the cross-border region. Among the partners listed in this proposal is Cavan County Council (CCC) who, while not making any financial contribution, will bring to the project their extensive experience in delivering road schemes and "Smarter Travel" walking and cycling projects in county Cavan. A decision on this application is due in September of this year.</p>  <p>  I understand that following on from the above mentioned initial unsuccessful NCN applications that all the authorities concerned came together to establish and address criteria which might impact on the delivery of the overall SLNCR project.  This work is ongoing and progress is being made on the necessary planning and environmental assessments associated with this project. This should help the authorities in the event of their making future application(s) for support under any future programmes.</p></reply>

CSO figures for 2015 show there were over 8.64 million overseas visits to Ireland, an increase of 13.7% on 2014.</p><p>This growth in overseas visits has been accompanied by strong growth in overseas tourism revenue. The CSO Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding air fares or ferry charges) for 2015 increased by 18.6%, compared to 2014.</p><p>Research carried out on behalf of the tourism agencies and tourism industry has found that certain market segments have a higher likelihood to select Ireland as a destination. Tourism Ireland's overseas marketing activity is weighted towards these segments in order to provide the best return on marketing investment.</p><p>In addition, the tourism brand experiences that have been developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, like the &quot;Wild Atlantic Way&quot;, &quot;Ireland's Ancient East&quot;, and  &quot;Dublin &ndash; A Breath of Fresh Air&quot; &ndash; are all designed to meet the needs of the most promising consumer segments in overseas source markets.</p><p>The Government's Tourism Policy Statement &quot;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&quot; was launched in March 2015. The main targets contained in the Tourism Policy Statement, to be achieved by 2025, are as follows:</p><p>- Overseas tourism revenue to increase to &euro;5 billion net of inflation, compared to &euro;3.5 billion in 2014;</p><p>- Overseas visits to Ireland to increase to ten million, compared to 7.6 million in 2014; and</p><p>- 250,000 people to be employed in the tourism sector, compared to around 205,000 at present.</p><p>In 2015, I appointed a Tourism Leadership Group to put in place a Tourism Action Plan containing key actions required in the period to 2018 in order to achieve the overall objectives in the Policy Statement. The Tourism Action Plan was published in January and contains actions across a range of key issues including skills in the tourism industry; supply of visitor accommodation; overseas tourism marketing, and the contribution of Local Authorities to tourism development.  My Department is now working closely with the tourism agencies on the implementation of all of the 23 actions contained in the Plan.</p></reply>

My Department receives regular updates and briefing from the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) on all relevant issues including the current Luas dispute.</p>  <p>  As part of these updates and briefing that I have been receiving in relation to the dispute, I was aware of the possibility of Transdev, taking certain measures but I should stress that my consent was not required.  I have no shareholder role in the case of Transdev.  I have already indicated that I do not personally agree with measures to recover strike costs from workers.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I have no function in relation to the employment, or terms and conditions of employment, of  Transdev employees.  Nor does NTA or TII have any employment relationship with Transdev employees.  They are employees of Transdev, a private company.  This dispute is between employees, as represented by SIPTU, and their employer, Transdev.  It is up to those two parties to reach a resolution with each other. </p>  <p>  I believe that any intervention by me, or indeed others without a legal function or role in this dispute, is not helpful.  Resolution of the dispute lies with the employer and the employees.  The State has well established industrial relations institutions which are ready to assist the relevant parties in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.  In that regard I welcome the news that bilateral talks are taking place this week between Transdev and its employees.</p>  <p>  I have been clear however that whatever resolution is arrived at between Transdev and its employees must be delivered within the overall contractual framework Transdev has with the State.  There cannot be, and there will not be, any change to that contract which runs until November 2019.  I will not be opening the chequebook on behalf of the taxpayer in this matter.  My focus is to protect the interests of the taxpayer and the travelling public, and to encourage the parties to work to resolve their differences in a manner that is fair, affordable, and sustainable.</p></reply>

The clams are quite small, are capable of self-fertilisation and each can produce up to 70,000 larvae in a year.  It is clear therefore that a programme of eradication by any of the methods considered could be very costly and, as it is impossible to ensure that all clams are removed, re-infestation is a high risk. </p>  <p>  However, my Department has been in contact an EPA-funded project based in the Institute of Technology, Sligo, which is working on Invasive Species prevention, control and eradication and, subject to the necessary environmental permissions, it is now  proposed to develop and carry out control trials, building on the work already done at Lanesborough and also using the results of trials in infested lakes in the United States.</p></reply>

It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  It is expected that this Plan will be finalised over the coming period and, subject to the approval of the Government, will be published thereafter.</p>  <p>  In the context of the finalisation of the Plan, my Department is considering the available options in terms of relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs and other alternatives and the invocation of certain provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and where there are no suitable alternatives. </p>  <p>  Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.  Similarly, the proof of overriding public interest under article 6.4 is very challenging and at best, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.  In addition, if an article 6.4 case can be and is successfully made, compensatory measures will be required to offset the negative effects of any losses to the habitat concerned and to ensure the overall coherence of the raised bog special area of conservation network. </p>  <p>  The position in relation to Coolrain Bog special area of conservation, amongst other sites, is being considered in the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.</p></reply>
