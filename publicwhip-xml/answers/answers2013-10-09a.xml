Furthermore the Government agreed to continue with the practice of excluding the payment of bonus provisions in the employment contracts of newly appointed CEOs to such State Companies as well as in respect of contract renewals for incumbent CEOs.</p><p>  The requirement to cease such forms of bonus payment together with other basic salary reductions introduced by this Government in respect of the CEOs in State Companies was necessitated by the very difficult financial and economic circumstances facing this country.  The Government will accordingly continue to consider future policy developments in relation to bonus payments for the CEOs concerned in the light of prevailing circumstances.</p></reply>

In light of these objectives my Department's strategy is to:</p><p>- improve the design of PMDS and streamline the PMDS process; and </p><p>- work with management across the Civil Service to strengthen the operation of PMDS. </p><p>  The PMDS process will be significantly streamlined by the introduction of an electronic PMDS system &ndash; ePMDS - to make the completion of PMDS forms possible online.  My Department is working to develop this system at present so that, in January 2014, it will &quot;go live&quot; for those Departments that have moved to PeoplePoint - the new HR Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service.</p><p>  The Phase 2 changes, agreed in July 2012 by my Department, together with management of the Civil Service and the unions, are being introduced for the current 2013 cycle.  These changes seek to address issues concerning  the perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of PMDS.  The most important of the changes in Phase 2 is the introduction of a formal system of calibration for the review of performance.  The process involves managers at the same grade-level meeting to discuss the performance of their jobholders with the aim of making sure that they apply similar standards for all jobholders and it should help to ensure greater balance and consistency in the award of ratings.</p><p>  My Department has also implemented other changes to the system aimed at improving fairness and consistency, including:</p><p>- A new grade-based Competency Framework has been introduced, together with a revised rating scale with improved descriptions of performance levels. </p><p>- A more comprehensive process of internal review of ratings, and access to external review, are under way.  The revised review procedures are being actively advanced with a view to early discussions with management and unions in the Civil Service so that these too will be in place for the final stages of the 2013 cycle.</p><p>- Finally, a rating of &quot;Fully Achieved Expectations&quot; is required for the award of an increment.</p><p>  Turning to the take-up of additional training courses across Departments as a result of PMDS reviews, this is a matter for each individual Department and Office on the basis of its own assessment of training and development needs.  My Department expects to have more detailed and comprehensive information available on take-up of training and development opportunities in the context of Learning and Development Shared Services Project which is currently under way. </p><p>  Progress is being made in renewing PMDS.  In 2012, compliance with PMDS rose to 85% - the highest level to date - up from 77% in 2011.  My Department will continue to work with all managers across the system to continue to ensure full compliance with PMDS as part of an overall focus on strengthening managerial performance.  A particular focus of attention for 2013 is the distribution of ratings with the aim of achieving a distribution of ratings that more accurately reflects performance across the system.  Although there has been some movement towards greater alignment with the expected statistical distribution, there remains relatively high levels of awards of the higher categories of ratings overall and very low levels of ratings in respect of underperformance. </p><p>  A key challenge for senior leadership across the Civil Service is to demonstrate their own commitment to delivering a high performance culture and to fully engage line managers in the management and improvement of performance.  My Department will continue to review how we manage performance in the Civil Service and on the basis of this we will continue to make changes aimed at improving PMDS as it is the primary tool for managing performance in the Civil Service.  My Department is committed to the ongoing strengthening of performance management to enable people to achieve their potential.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-09a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100900060#WRB00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.</p><p>  As the Deputies are aware, the rationalisation of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan.  My Department is currently monitoring the implementation of the measures on a quarterly basis.  The latest tables which detail this progress to end Quarter 3 2013 can be found on my Department's website.  In summary, the tables show that significant progress has been made by Departments on implementation.  To date, rationalisation and amalgamation measures involving 44 bodies have been fully implemented, most recently the abolition of the VECs, which were replaced by a much smaller number of Education and Training Boards.  Measures involving a further 63 bodies are at advanced legislative or administrative stages.  </p><p>  Further measures, involving 109 bodies, were identified under a critical review process undertaken in 2012 as part of the Public Service Reform Plan and are currently being implemented.  The Public Service Reform Plan aims to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme, a target that will be achieved.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the merged entities and from other administrative efficiencies<b>. </b></p><p>  From the outset I have maintained that the lasting and most important benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  Moreover, the rationalisation programme needs to be understood as just one of a package of reform measures that will allow for the continued delivery of critical services against the backdrop of reducing public service numbers.  There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.  </p><p>  Within my own area of control the Commission on Public Service Appointments was merged into the Office of the Ombudsman with effect from October 2012.  Arrangements are also currently underway for the merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland; and the measure concerning the State Laboratory and the Forensic Science Laboratory is progressing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-09a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100900060#WRB00900"><p>Retirement lump sums are payable to Public Servants in accordance with the terms of relevant legislation and Superannuation Schemes.  Lump sum benefits on retirement were introduced in the Civil Service in 1909 with a commensurate reduction in the accrual rate for actual pension from 60ths to 80ths &ndash; most pension schemes in the Public Service now provide benefits on the same basis.</p><p>  It is to be noted that the substantial pay reductions applied to date under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts have the effect of reducing the cost of retirement lump sums throughout the Public Service.  It should also be noted that retirement lump sums in excess of &euro;200,000 are subject to tax on the excess amount while the Standard Fund Threshold for an individual's overall pension benefits is now &euro;2.3 million, reduced from the previous level of &euro;5.4 million.  </p><p>  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 introduced a new Single Public Service Pension Scheme which commenced on 1 January of this year.  The Single Scheme provides that new entrant Public Servants appointed on or after that date, including Members of the Oireachtas, will be members of the Scheme and will have their pension benefits based on career average earnings as opposed to the current final salary basis.  The Scheme also provides for a new minimum pension age of 66, rising to age 67 in 2021 and age 68 in 2028 in line with changes to the age at which the State Pension (Contributory) will become payable.  These changes will lead to a substantial reduction in the cost of overall superannuation benefits, including lump sum payments, in the Public Service into the future.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy that Public Service pay and pension costs will be kept under review as part of the Government's ongoing strategy to bring the public finances to a sustainable level.</p></reply>

The OGP is a global multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.  It is overseen by a multi-stakeholder International Steering Committee consisting of Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, Tanzania, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as civil society representatives.</p><p>  Recognising the critical importance of the full participation of civil society interests in this process, proposals for inclusion in the action plan were discussed at three public meetings of a network of civil society and other interests held over the summer months, as well as through online contributions.  This public consultation process was coordinated by Transparency International Ireland following a tender process undertaken by this Department. </p><p>  The Report of a Consultation with Civil Society Representatives and Citizens on Ireland's Participation in the Open Government Partnership process was submitted to my Department on 1st October.  Development of Ireland's first national action plan is therefore now well under way.   It is anticipated that Ireland's draft action plan will be submitted for final approval by Government before the end of 2013.  Countries become full members of the OGP when they submit their action plans by posting the final versions on the OGP website and endorse the Open Government Declaration.  It is expected that Ireland will become a full member no later than 31st March 2014.  </p><p>  I wish to highlight that developing the action plan is just the first step.

The purpose of the scheme is to assist Government in implementing restructuring and reform in a strategic and targeted manner.  Greater efficiencies in the way the public service is going about its business means that some posts have and may be identified by Departments as surplus.  VR can be offered in such circumstances. </p><p>  In terms of my own Department, there is currently no VR scheme in operation and none is planned.

In this regard, Minister of State Brian Hayes worked closely with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator's private members' Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation.  I believe that there is considerable support both inside and outside the D&aacute;il for these reforms.  The Act, which is subject to a Commencement Order, to allow for the development of a comprehensive code of practice was signed into law on the 29 July 2013.</p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Act is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts.  This issue is addressed in the Act by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments.  This will reduce the subcontractor's exposure to non-payment.  The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights, by suspending their labour and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication. </p><p>  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector.  This legislation is a priority for Government.  In this regard, my officials are currently working on the code of practice that will deliver a timely and cost effective adjudication procedure and to give effect to the legislation.</p></reply>

This further pension cut is based on applying the &quot;Public Service Pension Reduction&quot; (PSPR) to the combined value of the multiple public service pensions held by such a person, rather than to each such pension individually.  This aggregation of pensions for PSPR purposes reduces the overall public service pension income of affected pensioners, including significant numbers of pensioners who receive both a TD pension and a Ministerial pension.</p><p>  Actual application of these PSPR aggregation-derived adjustments is currently in train across public service pensioner payrolls.  The overall process is complicated by several factors, including the need in each case to make co-ordinated adjustments to at least two pensions, along with the different payroll schedules and payment periodicities of pensioner payrolls.  On this basis it is - unfortunately - not possible at present to supply a finalised list of Ministerial and TD pension amounts which would comprehensively reflect all of the PSPR aggregation-related reductions impacting pensions with effect from 1 September 2013.  I nonetheless expect that this information will be to hand shortly and I will have it forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p></reply>

In this context, I would highlight the final report of the Implementation Body, which concluded that the Croke Park Agreement delivered significant cost savings amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime.  The Agreement also ensured the delivery of central reforms while acting as a facilitator for a large number of reforms at sectoral level, across all sectors of the Public Service, in a climate of industrial peace.  The report also concluded that the overwhelming majority of commitments around cost extraction, reform and changed work practices had been substantially delivered. </p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement sets out the basis for the contribution of a further &euro;1 billion by the public service pay and pensions bill to our fiscal recovery, which would not have been possible under the framework of the Croke Park Agreement. The &euro;1 billion reduction in the public service pay and pensions bill is critical to ensuring that we deliver on our targets for fiscal consolidation.</p><p>  The Agreement has already started to deliver on its objectives.  Approximately &euro;300 million in savings arising from the Agreement were incorporated into the Revised Estimates for 2013.  Since 1 July, a number of changes in work practices and reforms have been implemented.  In addition public servants are working longer hours which will result in the provision of a total of 15 million additional working hours across all sectors of the Public Service. </p><p>  The additional working hours by public servants will help us to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity by reducing the requirement for paid overtime hours and agency costs, thereby leading to direct cash savings; and allowing management to maintain services against the backdrop of decreasing staff numbers. </p><p>  The various reforms under the Agreement will allow us to implement long term sustainable change with a view to delivering a more efficient and effective modern Public Service capable of delivering high quality services to the citizens of this country.</p></reply>

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  In this regard, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. The report estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million on an addressable spend of &euro;7 billion, depending on the approach taken.</p><p>  In order to realise these benefits the National Procurement Service has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:</p><p>- cash savings; </p><p>- administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; </p><p>- greater purchasing expertise; </p><p>- improved consistency; and,</p><p>- enhanced service levels. </p><p>  In relation to plans for further reform of public procurement, the review also found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:</p><p>- integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;</p><p>- strengthening spend analytics and data management;</p><p>- much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;</p><p>- examining the specifications set out for goods and services;</p><p>- evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and</p><p>- strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  Since the appointment of the Chief Procurement Officer on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops / meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the National Procurement Service has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the National Procurement Service also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  I am aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of SMEs in the award of public contracts. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the National Procurement Service has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the National Procurement Service also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. On average 5000 tenders for the procurement of goods, services and works are advertised on eTenders every year. I am informed by the National Procurement Service that the latest information available relates to 2010. In that year, the National Procurement Service estimates that approximately 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers.</p><p>  The importance of procurement policy becomes apparent when one sees that each year public authorities across the European Union spend 19% of GDP or approximately &euro;2.4 trillion on goods, services and works. In this context, it is important to realise that the open market regime offers critical opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade Ireland offer training and support to businesses in order to raise awareness of public procurement opportunities and to improve the capacity of indigenous firms to compete effectively for these opportunities.</p></reply>

This exercise was carried out by all Departments in order to identify ways of reducing expenditure in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery. Following on from this, the Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i> , published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.</p><p>  The <i>Expenditure Report 2013 was </i>published on 5 December 2012 and includes further well-specified expenditure savings measures across every area of Government spending.  The Deputy might be interested to know that both of these documents, along with a range of other informative reports and data are available on my Department's website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.per.gov.ie</font></i>  .  </p><p>  The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for our EU/IMF Programme of financial assistance was signed in December 2010, and following each of the subsequent quarterly reviews by the Troika, an update of the MoU is agreed.  Each update to the MoU can include the protraction or revisions to existing commitments along with new commitments.</p><p>  The Irish Government's commitment to the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support remains firm as is clearly illustrated by our continued strong record in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and measures while meeting all quantitative targets.  Indeed, data released in the Exchequer Statement of 2 October, indicated that the Exchequer primary deficit target outlined in the EU/IMF Programme was met for the twelfth consecutive quarter.  It is the Government's intention to achieve a successful and durable exit from our programme and to make a full and sustainable return to the financial markets.</p></reply>

As well as its tourist and heritage attractiveness to visitors, it is also the preferred chosen venue for frequent formal events and functions of social, cultural, artistic, civic and diplomatic significance.   However, its capacity to deal with an ever-increasing demand is severely limited currently by a number of key factors, most notably the physical limitations of the building which was obviously constructed with a different purpose in mind and which is not ideally configured to sustain an exponentially increasing volume of visitors.  It is expected that further pressure will be an inevitable consequence of an expected increase in visitor numbers in the period ahead, particularly in the context of the interest generated by the various commemoration events over the next few years.</p><p>  At current levels, the existing Gaol building is at absolute capacity and cannot sustain further large scale increases in visitor traffic without significant risk to the fabric of the Monument and to the comfort and safety of visitors.  </p><p>  A possibility for expansion was identified in the adjacent former Kilmainham Court House building which will be adapted and incorporated into the Heritage site offering.  This will allow the Gaol operation to expand and will greatly improve the possibilities for strong continued visitor growth, while creating additional capacity to deal with visitors in a more modern setting and providing the needed ancillary curatorial, exhibition, research and welfare facilities which must be regarded as key objectives in a national heritage presentation of this type.   </p><p>  A public event was held at the Courthouse building in July this year when the Courts Service formally handed over the building to the Commissioners of Public Works, thus signalling the public commencement of this significant and important cultural and historic project.</p><p>  The initial phase of works, which has commenced, focusses on the renewal of the roof fabric and later phases will address the substantive works needed to provide for modern visitor facilities appropriate to this nationally-important site.  The project is targeted to be completed in time for the 1916 Centenary commemoration.</p></reply>

We are not in a position to say whether the actions undertaken by Greenpeace were merely a case of illegal entry or if any risks to the safety or operation of the rig were involved.  However, I would urge the Russian authorities to respond in a proportionate way to any breach of the law which I hope can lead to a rapid release of those involved.  In that connection, I note statements reportedly made by President Putin to the effect that he does not personally consider the incident to be an act of piracy. I would also call on the Russian authorities to ensure that the activists receive the legal and consular assistance to which they are entitled.</p></reply>

This commitment was expressed and enhanced  by the publication earlier this year of our new Policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; which clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world, and our goals and areas of focus for the coming years.  It also reaffirms the centrality of the aid programme to our foreign policy.  The new policy states clearly our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA) when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Over the past two years, the Government has broadly stabilised the budget for development assistance &ndash; allocating &euro;629 million on ODA in 2012 and &euro;622 million in 2013.  These very significant allocations of public funds clearly demonstrate that we have consolidated the development assistance budget - a major achievement in light of the very difficult fiscal conditions facing the Government.  Equally importantly, our aid programme remains one of the best in the world and our leadership on the hunger and nutrition agendas continues to be acknowledged internationally.</p><p>  The Estimates process for Budget 2014 is now in its final stages and is being framed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal consolidation strategy.  The Departmental budget allocations for 2014 will be a matter for Government decision and will be announced in the Budget Statement next week.</p></reply>

These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade  and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  The figures in the tables below include expenditure charged to mission budgets.  Salary and related costs of staff posted from Ireland are not included as they are a charge on the overall budget of the Department rather than on a specific mission.  Local staff salaries in missions abroad are reflective of the prevailing labour market conditions in the host country.  Capital expenditure is not included as such expenditure does not form part of the Mission&rsquo;s budget.  For ease of reference, the figures provided have been separated into Vote 28 Foreign Affairs and Trade and Vote 27 International Cooperation.  The costs of a number of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid are charged to Vote 27.  The effective implementation of the aid programmes necessarily entails additional management and oversight costs which are included in the figures provided below.

These targets have been identified by the relevant Departments and the State Agencies under their aegis.  In overseas markets, my Department and our Embassy network work very closely with the State Agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  In the twenty seven priority overseas markets identified under the Strategy, Local Market Teams chaired by the Ambassador and including the State Agencies present in the particular market have been established to drive the common effort towards the achievement of the identified targets.  Local Market Plans drawn up by these teams are reviewed by the Export Trade Council which I chair and which includes the relevant Ministers as well as the CEOs of the State Agencies and members from the private sector.  The work of my Department and the Embassy network in engaging with key political and business figures in overseas markets, and on economic messaging designed to enhance confidence in our economic recovery, contributes directly to the achievement of the growth in domestic employment, as does the ongoing extensive support given by our Embassies to the trade missions organised by the State Agencies.  This year our Embassies will support a total of eighteen Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions involving Irish companies, as well as a range of other overseas Ministerial visits focussed on driving job growth at home through building our international trading and investment opportunities, in both mature and high growth markets.  Each year the St. Patrick's Day period provides a particular focus for our efforts to support job creation in the domestic economy and the Embassy network exploits to the full all the opportunities it provides for Ministerial led missions and other economic, business and cultural activity.</p><p>  The Global Irish Network established by my Department is also contributing its ideas and support to the drive for jobs and I am pleased to note that at the most recent meeting of the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle last weekend there was a very positive interaction at an Enterprise Ireland industry event between the Irish SME sector and the network.</p></reply>

In the context of Government policy on e-Government and e-payments, and Revenue&rsquo;s strategic objective of establishing the use of electronic channels as the norm, this seems to me to be a reasonable approach.  Filing and paying of LPT is easier and more efficient online and taxpayers get more time to file.</p><p>  Many owners of multiple properties impacted by this provision are in the business of letting those properties and it is improbable that they are not e-enabled for other purposes.  However, recognising the need to provide an alternative service, the LPT legislation explicitly provides that a liable person may nominate another person &ndash; such as an agent or family member &ndash; to file on his or her behalf.  Furthermore, from the outset, Revenue advised that owners of multiple properties could call to a Revenue office where staff would assist them to file their return electronically on Revenue computers.  Finally, I am advised that during the LPT filing season Revenue recognised this requirement was causing difficulties in a number of instances where liable persons own small numbers of properties, and they provided a further option to pay and file by telephone.</p><p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s response provides an appropriate range of options for owners of multiple properties to meet their LPT obligations. </p></reply>

Any individual with income, and this can include maintenance income, not taxed through the PAYE system must pay their tax through the self-assessment system.  While this does include self-employed individuals it can also include persons in receipt of interest, dividends, rents, etc.  A divorced person in receipt of taxable maintenance payments is therefore not classified as a self-employed person but rather as a chargeable person and pays the income tax due on their income through the self-assessment system.  This classification is simply the method through which the tax due on the maintenance payments, if any, is collected.</p><p>  The same rates of income tax apply regardless of whether an individual pays their tax through the PAYE system or the self-assessment system. </p><p>To prevent double taxation of income, where a divorced person is liable to pay tax on receipt of a maintenance payment, then the divorced person paying the maintenance payment is entitled to a tax deduction for that maintenance payment.</p></reply>

Revenue opinions are non-binding and seek to provide a considered and consistent interpretation of the applicable tax rules as set down in the legislation.</p><p>  Revenue's practice in providing advance opinions to taxpayers is set out in published guidelines and tax briefings including, for example, the <i>Guidelines on Revenue's Technical Service to Practitioners and Business Taxpayers</i>   which are available on the Revenue website. As there is a wide range of taxation information on the Revenue website and in Revenue publications, there are relatively limited circumstances where a company or tax practitioner should require an opinion from Revenue in advance of a proposed transaction or business activity.</p><p>  An advance opinion will be given by Revenue only where the issues are complex, the transaction is unusual, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the interpretation or application of the relevant tax rules.

Such companies are obliged to file a corporation tax return in respect of their Irish branch operations; however, the return does not require them to provide their country of residence for tax purposes.  </p><p>  While non-resident companies within the charge to Irish corporation tax are not required to indicate their country of residence in their annual corporation tax return, section 882 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which was introduced in Finance Act 1999) requires companies incorporated in the State to provide certain particulars to Revenue within 30 days of commencing to carry on a business. Particulars to be provided include the company&rsquo;s name, registered address, place of business, date of commencement of the business and, in the case of a company not resident in the State, the name of the territory in which it is tax resident.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that newly incorporated companies coming within the charge to Irish corporation tax are registered with Revenue for tax purposes. </p><p>  While there is no specific penalty for failing to provide a country of residence in the statement of particulars, a company that fails to deliver a statement of particulars under section 882 is liable to a penalty of &euro;4,000, with provision for a further penalty of &euro;60 for each day on which the failure continues after a court judgement has been obtained. </p><p>  There is no requirement in Irish tax law for a company to claim or obtain authorisation of non-resident status from Revenue and statistics on the number of Irish registered non-resident companies are not separately compiled. As a result, Revenue does not have an estimate of the number of such companies, the numbers of such companies by country of residence or the number of such companies that have not declared a country of residence. Nonetheless, Revenue as part of its normal compliance activity seeks confirmation from companies from time to time as to how they are structured with a view to ensuring that all relevant corporation tax rules are correctly applied.</p></reply>

Tralee has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth. In that context, a project for the school has not been included in the current 5 year plan.  My Department's over-riding objective is to ensure that every child has access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. To ensure that this is achieved, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-10-09a.202.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013100900069#WRL00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79, 81 and 82 together.</p><p>  All of these questions relate to Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  In relation to SNA contracts, the position is that the standard contract for SNAs was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  This standard contract has not been amended recently nor are there any current plans to amend the standard SNA contract.</p><p>  In that context, the position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs.  The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc.  The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;</p><p>  This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.</p><p>  Furthermore, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p><p>  In relation to the suggestion that the agreed working hours/working week for an SNA should be altered and-or that there is a policy of wage curtailment being pursued in respect of SNAs the position is as follows.  The Deputy will be aware that a new set of proposals for a public service agreement were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). Two of the key aspects of this Agreement relate to working hours for all public servants and remuneration, increments and related balancing measures.  The measures in respect of remuneration, increments and related balancing measures for SNAs were given effect in DES Circular 34/2013 which issued on 27 June 2013 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:  </p><p>  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<blockquote>SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.</blockquote>As the LRC proposals which formed the Haddington Road Agreement are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.  If an individual SNA has a dispute over their salary, and if they are a Department paid SNA, then in the first instance they should raise the matter directly with the NTS Payroll section of my Department who have responsibility for the payment of SNAs on the Departmental payroll.  An SNA employed by an Education and Training Board should raise the matter directly with their own employer.</p><p>  In respect of the point made regarding overpayments of salary the position is that such overpayments occur for numerous reasons and the recoupment of overpayments is dealt with in line with my Department's published policy and procedures for dealing with Overpayments of Salary (DES circular 15/04 which is available on the Department's website at the following address ).  The occurrence of overpayments is avoidable and with co-operation, the inconvenience caused to staff members in such situations can be alleviated. It is acknowledged that it may not always be possible for school management-staff members to provide the Department with the required written notification in advance. In that instance, it should be possible to contact the Department directly - by phone or e-mail; thereby lessening the risk of the staff member concerned being overpaid.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  It is important to note that SNA allocations are not permanent, as the level of SNA support allocated to a school may be increased or decreased as pupils who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. They are also decreased where a child's care needs may have diminished over time.</p><p>  Special need assistants are employed by the managerial authorities of the individual primary and second level schools or by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).The recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal-Board of Management.  The Board is the SNA's employer and the terms of employment are subject to the conditions of the contract of employment.  The exact hours of work will normally be specified by the Board of Management in the SNAs contract of employment and may vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.  Where a Board or ETB are obliged to reduce the hours of an existing SNA, the conditions governing that are currently set out in Departmental Circulars 58/06 and 59/06.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p></reply>

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold <i>inter alia</i> EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  It is the student's own nationality and residency in the state that determines eligibility under the schemes.  The Department of Justice and Equality adjudicates on a person's entitlement to remain in the State and on the stamp that is awarded where permission to remain is sanctioned. A 'stamp 4' does not of itself convey any entitlement to public services.  Higher education institutions determine the entitlements of students to free fees based on meeting the prescribed conditions of the Schemes and in cases where students do not qualify for free fees it is a matter for the institutions, as autonomous bodies, to determine the rate of fee to apply.</p></reply>

As part of this process, QQI will require applicants to provide a statutory declaration in which all owners and/or influential persons associated with the applicant will have to respond to a number of questions including whether they have been adjudicated bankrupt, whether they have made a composition or arrangement with creditors, whether they have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, whether they have been convicted of an indictable offence, whether they have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, or whether they have been the subject of an order under section 160 of the Companies Act 1990.</p><p>  Therefore the past history of directors and influential persons associated with a particular provider will be taken into account when deciding whether or not that provider should be allowed to apply for validation of programmes by QQI. This also applies to providers of English language training which seek ACELS recognition.</p></reply>

A System Performance Framework has been published which outlines key system objectives and indicators for the system as a whole. No single institution can hope to deliver comprehensively against all these objectives. Instead, the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 supports the development of a system of diverse institutions, with each institution delivering in different ways against these overarching objectives.</p><p>  The development of research capacity is a key objective for the system overall, but it is not expected that each higher education institution will be research intensive. Quality research requires a level of critical mass of activity and initiatives underway as part of the recently announced plans for the reconfiguration of the sector, such as the development of regional clusters and the establishment of technological universities, will enable the further development of research capabilities across the system.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The staffing arrangements for schools for the current school year, 2013/14 are set out in Department Circular 0013/2013 which is available on the website.My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year. The national average class size is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of SMEs in the award of public contracts. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>   website;</p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract; and</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p><p>  My Department is keen to streamline procurement processes - consistent with its value for money, legal, transparency and probity objectives. In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement process, the National Procurement Service as part of the new Office of Government Procurement is promoting standardisation and simplification of the public procurement function.  It has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which will help both businesses and buyers to reduce administrative costs.  </p><p>  In addition my Department has developed contracts for Public Works and Construction-Related Services that give greater cost certainty at tender stage, for capital projects. The construction reform initiative has yielded substantial savings in capital procurement.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p></reply>

This exercise was carried out by all Departments in order to identify ways of reducing expenditure in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.</p><p>  Following on from this, the Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report</i>  , published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  A new Comprehensive Review of Expenditure exercise will be carried out early next year.</p><p>  The <i>Expenditure Report 2013 was </i>  published on 5 December 2012 and included further well-specified expenditure savings measures across every area of Government spending. The Government policy on Budget 2014 measures is currently being finalised and the Budget announcement will be made on the 15th of October 2013.</p><p>  The EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support is subject to policy conditionality which is set out in programme documents - the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MOU), the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The conditionality in these documents is subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the Troika) to ensure the broad programme objectives are met. Such assessment is undertaken at the quarterly reviews.  Each update to the MoU can include the protraction or revisions to existing commitments along with new commitments.</p><p>  The Irish Government's commitment to the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support remains firm as is clearly illustrated by our continued strong record in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and measures while meeting all quantitative targets.  We are in the final year of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support and having<font color="#2F2F2F"> successfully concluded the eleventh review mission of our EU-IMF Programme the data released in the Exchequer Statement on 2 October indicates that the Exchequer primary deficit target was met for the twelfth consecutive quarter. In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all quantitative fiscal targets and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognised by the Troika.</font></p></reply>

This publication presents a detailed breakdown of both gross and net pay and pension expenditure in aggregate terms, by sector and by individual Vote and is available on my Department's website at <i><i><font color="#0000FF">www.per.gov.ie</font></i></i><i></i>under the Reports tab.</p><p>  In addition the Deputy will be aware, that Ireland is committed to reducing its general government deficit to less than 3% by 2015.  If the public service pay and pensions bill at 36% of spending is to make a proportionate contribution to the necessary additional expenditure reduction currently identified as necessary for the next 3 years based on current economic forecasts, it requires a further reduction of some &euro;1 billion in the cost of the pay and pensions bill with &euro;300 million of that saving to be delivered in 2013.  On this basis the Government through public service employers entered into discussions with public service unions to achieve agreement on the necessary reductions.  They negotiated a difficult and complex set of proposals under the Haddington Road Agreement which will deliver the necessary &euro;1bn saving in the public service pay and pensions bill by 2015 while ameliorating the impacts for public service staff on low and middle incomes to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

This approach unpins the current programme of reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government's Public Service Reform Plan.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.</p><p>  In this regard, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report of the review, which was published in late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.  The report estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million on an addressable spend of &euro;7 billion, depending on the approach taken.</p><p>  In saving over the last two years the National Procurement Service as part of the newly formed Office of Government Procurement has reported procurement savings to the end of 2012 under its frameworks of &euro;93.1m, comprising of &euro;7.5m in 2010, &euro;46.5m in 2011 and a further &euro;39.1m for 2012, which include administrative savings.<b></b> I would point out that further work is underway within the newly established Office of Government Procurement to develop a more accurate methodology to measure savings. </p><p>  In relation to plans for further reform of public procurement, the review also found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.  In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda.  The new approach to public procurement will involve:- integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;- strengthening spend analytics and data management;- much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;- examining the specifications set out for goods and services;- evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and- strengthening supplier and category management.</p><p>  These reforms will lead to reductions in the cost of goods and services; better procurement services at lower cost; introduction of technical standardisation; greater attention to contract management and better problem resolution; greater levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been operational since 24 October 2012.  As at 4<sup>th</sup> October there were 69 live CGS facilities resulting in &euro;9.7m being sanctioned through the Scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 433 new jobs being created and 139 jobs maintained.   </p><p>  As take-up continued to be slow, the Scheme was recently independently reviewed with a view to identifying the reasons for this and recommending changes to the Scheme design.  The Review included detailed consultations with all key stakeholders.   A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, is currently assessing the expert Review and will shortly report back to me outlining what action needs to be taken to amend the Scheme.

It also preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming social welfare.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Expenditure on FIS for 2012 was of the order of &euro;224 million in respect of some 32,000 families. The estimated expenditure for 2013 is expected to be &euro;229 million. </font></p><p>  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p>  The applicant must also be living with or supporting his/her spouse and at least one qualified child.  In the case of parents who are separated, a parent who is wholly or mainly maintaining a former spouse can qualify for FIS.  This is provided for in Section 227 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, which sets out the definition of the family for this payment.  Section 230 (2) of the 2005 Act provides that only one FIS payment can be made in respect of any family and that a person included in one particular family for any period for FIS purposes shall not be regarded as a member of any other family during that period. Section 231 of the 2005 Act provides that FIS shall be payable to the member of the family who is engaged in remunerative full-time employment as an employee or, where there are two members of the family engaged in full-time employment as an employee, to the member whose assessed weekly income forms the greater part of the weekly family income. Therefore, current provisions do not allow for FIS payments to be divided between parents. </p><p>  Where a question arises in determining the residence of a child for FIS purposes, an investigation of specific circumstances may be carried out. </p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail, she can arrange to have the details brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

Child benefit is paid to around 606,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2013. </p><p>The needs of the children are the priority consideration in the payment of child benefit. Under Section 220 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, child benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides and the child will not be regarded as normally residing with more than one person. Regulations governing normal residence for child benefit purposes are contained in S.I. 142/2007 (Article 159) and they provide <i>inter alia</i>  for the following:</p><p>(1) In the event that a qualified child is resident with both mother and father, he or she will be regarded as normally residing with the mother or step-mother;</p><p>(2) If mother and father are resident in separate households, the qualified child shall be regarded as normally residing with the person with whom he or she resides for the majority of the time.</p><p>  In practice, child benefit is paid to the child's mother in all cases except where the parents are separated and the father has responsibility for the full-time care of the child for more than 50% of the time.  </p><p>  The regulations governing the scheme does not provide for the splitting of the payment between parties in cases of shared residency arrangements for the child.  </p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to have a particular case considered in further detail by the Department, I will arrange this if she sends me the details.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2013, providing a total allocation of &euro;37 million.</p><p>A total of some 1,000 schools/organisations received funding under the school meals local projects for the school year 2012/13.  Of these, 15 were based in county Longford and 20 in county Westmeath. In addition, approximately 305 schools participated in the urban school meals scheme operated by local authorities, none of which were located in counties Longford and Westmeath. The Department is currently processing applications from schools participating in the scheme for the current school year.</p><p>The scheme operates on a school year basis and all schools must apply for funding on an annual basis. Maximum rates of payment apply, based on a rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided.  Details of the various options available under the scheme and the maximum rates of payment per child are shown in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>Priority for funding under the school meals local projects is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).</p><p>Funding under the scheme is for food costs only, subject to certain conditions.  All food must be of suitable quality and nutritional value, and prepared and consumed in an appropriate environment. The type and range of meals provided, as well as the method and logistics of supplying the meals, are decided by the individual local groups and schools that operate the projects. Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school/organisation.</p><p>The additional &euro;2 million allocated to the school meals programme budget for 2013 is being used to extend the school meals local projects scheme to DEIS and special schools. The Department contacted approximately 170 schools requesting expressions of interest in participating in the scheme for the current school year. Expressions of interest in joining the scheme were received from approximately 90 schools. To date, applications from an additional 32 schools, 1 of which is located in Co Westmeath, have been processed and further applications will be processed as schools establish their food clubs.</p><p>Any further extension to the school meals programme can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p><p><b>Various food options and maximum payment per child:</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>Meals</b></th><th><b>Cost</b></th><th><b>-</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Breakfast</b>/<b>Snack</b></td><td> &euro;0.60</td><td>Cereal, Toast, Scone, Fruit, Yogurt, Milk, Juice<br />-2 Items must be provided</td></tr><tr><td><b>Lunch</b></td><td> &euro;1.40</td><td>Filled Sandwich/Roll <i>or</i> Soup &amp;amp; Roll <i>or</i><br />Salad Plate, <i>plus</i> 2 other items (eg Milk, Juice, Fruit, Yogurt)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Dinner</b></td><td> &euro;1.90</td><td>Meat, Potatoes &amp;amp; Vegetables <i>or</i> Chicken <br />Curry <i>or</i> Spaghetti Bolognaise, <i>plus</i> a drink (Milk, Juice, Water)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

FIS also preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming social welfare.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Expenditure on FIS for 2012 was of the order of &euro;224 million in respect of some 32,000 families.

Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him/her or is supported by him/her.</p><p>  Creating jobs and reducing unemployment are key challenges facing the Government. The tax and social protection systems have a part to play in addressing these issues and in ensuring work is remunerative. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes. The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, including in-work supports such as FIS.</p></reply>

The rationale for this requirement is twofold. First it is designed to limit the potential for internships to displace existing or new paid  roles in an organisation. Second the purpose of internships is to offer jobseekers experience of a work environment where they can learn from, and be mentored by, work colleagues.  The Department takes the view that a host organisation requires at least one other employee to provide the necessary workplace environment to support mentoring of, and the acquisition of workplace skills by, interns.</p><p><b>Appendix:</b> <bu>Employment Size Thresholds for Internships.</bu></p><p><table><tr><th>Number of Full Time Employees*</th><th>Number of Internships</th></tr><tr><td>1-10 employees</td><td>1 internship place</td></tr><tr><td>11-20 employees</td><td>3 internship places</td></tr><tr><td>21-30 employees</td><td>4 internship places</td></tr><tr><td>30 + employees</td><td>20% of the workforce to a maximum of 200 internships whichever is the smaller</td></tr></table></p><p>* Who is employed for 30 hours or more per week (i.e. on payroll and subject to PAYE and PRSI)</p></reply>

RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year. Further information on the work of RPS can be found at<i></i><i>  .</i></p><p>  The draft plan will include a number of case studies to illustrate the scientific approach that will be needed for the restoration of all 53 raised bog SACs and to address concerns regarding implications for surrounding land. The surveys will involve site visits to verify drainage systems and to take other scientific measurements. I would like to make it clear that this is a scientific survey and that no restoration work is to take place during this survey. I would also like to make it clear that no future restoration work will be carried out on any raised bog SAC without full consultation and engagement with stakeholders. </p><p>  This is set out clearly in the documentation which has been produced to guide this process, which is available to the public on <i></i> The Raised Bog Conservation Study SEA Scoping Report states:<blockquote>  &quot;The development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was recommended by Mr. Justice John Quirke in his report following the 2012 Peatland Forum. A national plan was also called for in a unanimous D&aacute;il vote in 2012. The purpose of the plan is to provide the ability to explore whether there are any other options available for those sites where relocation is genuinely not possible. It also indicates how the 53 SACs are to be restored and managed into the future, which will be done in full consultation and partnership with those who own the bogs and surrounding land owners.&quot;</blockquote>  For the avoidance of all doubt, what is being conducted at the moment is a scientific survey. Comments in the local media from some parties about a risk of flooding arising from this simple scientific survey are unfounded. I am happy to reassure all partners in this process that this is a scientific survey and any future actions that might be proposed arising from it will only be considered in consultation with the local community and landowners. </p><p>  I would therefore encourage all turf cutting committees, property owners and stakeholders to engage with this very preliminary assessment, so that an informed discussion can begin on the future management options for each site.</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be met from renewable sources by 2020. All of the renewable energy support schemes provide subsidies to eligible projects as opposed to grant aid.</p><p>The Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run to the mid 2000s. AER was subsequently replaced by the feed-in tariff scheme known as REFIT. The AER schemes were all introduced prior to full electricity market liberalisation.</p><p>REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects. Both AER and REFIT are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.</p><p>The estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported. The following table presents the costs for both AER and REFIT since 2003 (the 2003 figure for AER is cumulative from the year 2000):</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>AER </b></th><th><b>REFIT</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>-8.0</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>7.1</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12</td><td>0.7</td><td>35.8</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>13.5</td><td>29.7</td></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>24.3</td><td>39.8</td></tr><tr><td>2008/9</td><td>-58.4</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>0.4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>-29.9</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>0.2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>12.3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>16.1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>6.6</td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The provision of electronic communications services, including broadband services and the restoration of full services when faults occur are, in the first instance, matters for the service providers operating in Ireland&rsquo;s fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). </p><p>  Where customers are experiencing difficulties in relation to any aspect of their telecommunications/broadband service they should raise the matter with their service provider. Where this fails to resolve matters, they should refer it to ComReg who will investigate the issue.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services. The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in living in County Cork. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including the islands, can be found on ComReg's website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). Broadband services under the NBS are available since October 2010 from the NBS service provider, &#8220;3&#8221;, to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in the designated NBS Electoral Divisions. The areas covered by the NBS include many of the islands around Ireland. The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission's Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013. </p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in living on the islands. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society. </p></reply>

To date over &euro;10 million has been advanced to AHBs using this facility which has supported the provision of 158 social housing units.  It is open to AHBs to consider and put forward proposals to meet housing need under the CALF.

It is proposed that 50% of the cost would be met by way of loan finance from the European Investment Bank to a number of AHB&rsquo;s who would undertake the retrofitting works and manage and maintain the properties on behalf of the local authority. The balance of the funding would be met by way of a 25% capital contribution by the Exchequer and a 25% grant from the European Regional Development Fund. Further social housing proposals of this nature and involving the EIB and the AHB&rsquo;s will be considered in the context of the outcome of this proposal.</p></reply>

The promotion of gender equality in local government is dealt with at paragraph 11.8 of the Programme.</p><p>  Part 6 of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 will require political parties to   achieve a gender balance in candidate selection at general elections. This provision links the State funding of political parties to the achievement of a gender balance in candidate selection at D&aacute;il general elections.  In order to receive full State funding, a qualified political party will have to have at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the next general election.  Seven years from the next general election, this will rise to 40%.  The new legislative provisions are designed as an incentive mechanism to encourage political parties to apply a more equal gender balance in the selection of candidates.  It is intended that this measure would have a knock-on effect by providing an incentive to political parties voluntarily to apply similar arrangements at local elections.</p><p>  As regards local government administration, recruitment competitions at senior level are held by the Public Appointments Service in co-operation with my Department and the relevant local authorities, all of whom are committed to the highest standards of customer service and comply with equality and other relevant legislation and codes of practice. Recruitment competitions held at local level adhere to the same high standards particularly in regards to equality legislation and related compliance.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy, provision of training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters and the provision of capital funding.</p><p>  Earlier in 2013 I published the policy document <i>Keeping Communities safe</i> (KCS), which is intended to keep fire safety and fire services in Ireland in line with international best practice.  KCS was developed to ensure that Ireland manages its fire risk effectively and continues the downward trend in the level of fire fatalities recorded annually.  The current annual rate of 6 .2 fire deaths per million of population places Ireland among the most fire safe countries.  KCS is based on the systems approach which emphasizes the further development and enhancement of fire prevention and fire protection a s well as fire service response.  KCS places an appropriate emphasis on isolated communities being prioritised for Community Safety programmes to ensure that households in such areas are given advice on fire prevention and have smoke alarms and other appropriate fire protection facilities.  These simple measures are regarded as the most effective means of ensuring the safety of person s in the case of fire.  Community fire safety initiatives involving the provision of fire prevention advice and smoke alarms, fire blankets and fire extinguishers were developed and provided for off-shore island communities and are maintained and renewed as appropriate by the relevant local authorities.</p><p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur as well as the fire protection measures in place.

The early retirement options available to the staff of my Department are the Ill Health Retirement Scheme and the Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme.  An employee with an on-going serious medical condition who has at least five years&rsquo; pensionable service may apply to retire on grounds of ill-health.  Ill health retirement applications are considered initially by the Chief Medical Officer, who on receipt of an application from an officer, offers a medical opinion as to whether an individual is incapable on medical grounds of regular and effective service at the time of the application and whether the medical incapacity is likely to be permanent.  Four applications for ill health retirement have been approved to date this year.  A further three applications are on hand.</p><p>  The Cost Neutral Early Retirement Scheme allows staff to retire before the normal retirement age but to have an off-setting actuarial reduction applied to their retirement benefits. There are currently no applications on hand under the Scheme.</p><p>  Following the receipt of sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department has recently introduced a voluntary redundancy scheme targeted towards civilian employees (State Industrial Grades) arising from the rationalisation of the brigade structure in the Defence Forces and the reduced requirement for particular grades/skills in the civilian workforce.  There are currently no applications on hand under the Scheme.   It is not possible at this stage to predict the number of employees that will avail of this particular redundancy scheme between now and 2014.</p></reply>

In the new CFP Reform we have, for the first time, introduced a regionalised approach to fisheries management.  We have moved away from the old system of an EU decision making approach centralised in Brussels.  The new policy puts fishermen at the core of developing conservation measures for fisheries in which they are involved and also makes specific references to the needs of small scale fishermen and small offshore islands.  I will be working closely with my counterparts in the new regional forums to ensure that decisions that reflect the real issues in our region are developed and implemented.</p><p>  Many of the stocks fished by island communities are not subject to an EU TAC and quota management regime, although other requirements may be specified in EU law, such as minimum landing sizes.  For such non TAC and quota species, management measures applying to Irish registered vessels fishing within inshore waters are developed nationally, though the EU Commission must be consulted before enactment.  In the development of such national management measures, I always seek and fully consider any submissions from industry representatives.  I am presently seeking views on proposed national management measures for lobster and shrimp.  The closing date for submissions is 25 October 2013.</p></reply>

It is estimated that approximately 70 staff will retire in similar circumstances in 2014.  The Government has approved the principle of a targeted Voluntary Redundancy Scheme for my Department, should this be required in the progression of the Department&rsquo;s major re-organisation and re-structuring programme which commenced in 2005.  This has been the subject of discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform during the course of the last year.  To-date, the Scheme has not been rolled out for 2013 and it is unlikely that it will impact on numbers in 2014.  Our Reform Programme has yielded viable re-deployment opportunities for a significant number of staff who have transferred to other Government Departments/Offices in the last number of years.  This process is continuing and will take precedence over any Voluntary Redundancy Scheme.</p></reply>

The EWS has a current staffing complement of 74 officers delivering front line services, 2 of whom have distinct duties in relation to the education of children in places other than recognised schools.</p><p>  Within that frontline cohort, there are currently two Education Welfare Officers in Donegal; one serving north Donegal and one serving south Donegal.</p><p>  In addition, the NEWB is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through the integrated working of its three service strands, namely; the Education Welfare Service (EWS); Home School Community Liaison Programme (HSCL &ndash; 402 school-based co-ordinators); and School Completion Programme (SCP &ndash; &euro;26.456m in funding provided to support 124 school cluster projects and related initiatives). This integrated model of service will provide an enhanced response to the needs of children, families and schools. As part of this process the NEWB is also reviewing the basis on which the EWS was originally configured and a full consultation process is underway with EWS staff and their representatives to reconfigure and optimise service delivery to ensure an appropriate correlation between EWO resources, student population and their needs. I see this strategic national approach as a crucial reform in our efforts to tackle school absenteeism.</p><p>  Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving, are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible, working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.</p></reply>

The programme is being co-funded by  philanthropic partners and is expected to have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The programme is being introduced on foot of the Programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty, drawing on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched and improve the outcomes for children and young people.

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. </p><p>  Fluoride may be added to public water supplies either in the form of hydrofluosilicic acid complying with the specifications for that substance in Schedule 1 to the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 (SI 42 of 2007) or in such other form as may be approved by the Minister.  Chemifloc Ltd. is the company contracted by the HSE for the supply and delivery of hydrofluosilicic acid for the purpose of water fluoridation.  Fluoride is sourced as a primary product in Spain, mined directly from a raw material source - the mineral fluorospar.  It goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.  This process is conducted by a company in Spain - Derivados del Fluor.  The fluoride is added to the public water supplies at water treatment plants throughout the country by the local authorities acting as agents for the health authorities as provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.</p><p>  The Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 requires that a daily test is carried out at water treatment plants by the local authority water services staff to determine fluoride content.  Monthly fluoride testing is carried out by the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency also carries out testing which requires monitoring of fluoride levels in water supplies. </p><p>  Some European countries use an alternative systemic approach to fluoridation such as salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation in their public health programmes.  Others use fluoride mouth-rinses and/or tooth-brushing or painting of teeth with fluorides.  Additionally, all European countries promote the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes. </p><p>  The USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia actively fluoridate water supplies.  Over 204 million people (approximately 66% of the population) in the USA receive fluoridated water with coverage having increased by around 24 million people between 2002 and 2012.</p><p>  No claim associating water fluoridation at the optimal level with negative health effects has been substantiated.  A known side effect at this level is enamel fluorosis, which is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look and is generally easy to treat.  This is in contrast to the treatment of tooth decay which may on occasion involve the use of general anaesthesia and hospitalisation.  Fluorosis has been rigorously monitored in Ireland and changes in fluorosis levels were responded to by lowering the levels of fluoride in water from 2007 and advising on the appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste. </p><p>  The European Commission Report 2011 to which the Deputy refers is presumably the Report of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). It states that a narrow margin exists in children between achieving the beneficial effects of fluoride in reducing dental decay and the potential adverse effect of dental fluorosis.  This is true regardless of the source of fluoride, whether from water fluoridation or other sources, such as ingested toothpaste.  The maximum fluoride concentration allowed in fluoridated water in Ireland is 0.8 mg/l.  The SCHER conclusions derive from concentrations exceeding 0.8mg/l; 1.5mg/l and 3mg/l.  It cannot be inferred from these conclusions that children here are exposed to unsafe doses of fluoride on a daily basis.</p><p>  The impact of water fluoridation on caries levels in Ireland has been regularly assessed in both national and local surveys since its introduction in the mid 1960s.  The national studies which have been undertaken are Children's Dental Health in Ireland 1984; Oral Health of Irish Adults 1989-1990; Oral Health of Irish Adults 2000-2002; North South Survey of Children's Oral Health 2002.  In addition, regional studies were undertaken in the 1990s and a cross border study in 2006.  All show a substantial benefit of fluoride in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.  At present a research project &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth &quot; (FACCT) is being conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre, University College Cork and supported by the HSE. </p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by major international scientifically validated reviews.  The effects of fluoride on health and related matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

The Standards seek to ensure that residential services have all the necessary safeguards and protections for people with disabilities as well as ensuring that the unique and complex needs of each individual person are met in an appropriate manner by service providers and their staff.</p><p>  In relation to access to financial accounts of service users, the standards specifically state that each person should be supported to take responsibility for their own financial affairs.  The standards request service providers to ensure service users have easy access to personal monies and control their own financial affairs in accordance with their wishes.  In addition, where service users need support to manage their financial affairs, they may nominate a person to be entrusted with this responsibility.  Nominated persons are required to keep an account of all monies spent and if such persons are also staff members, they are also accountable to the person in charge as well as the service user concerned.</p><p>  The regulations required to underpin these standards in law are now complete and the scheme of registration and inspection of residential services for people with disabilities is expected to commence in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This allows data to be submitted to the NTPF from hospitals on a weekly basis and, for the first time, outpatient data is available on www.ntpf.ie. For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has been set of 12 months for a first time consultant-led outpatient appointment and this is reflected in the HSE service plan.

These aims are balanced in an attempt to maximise public health gain from available resources. As part of the pricing policies there has been a price freeze (i.e. no price increases allowed except in exceptional circumstances) for a number of years.</p><p>  Over the last few years thousands of price reductions on medicines have occurred. For example, the price of over 500 different presentations of various medicines will reduce by between 5% and 29% on the 1st November 2013 as a consequence of agreements reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI).</p><p>  Occasionally, price increases are required to maintain supplies of specific essential medicines. However, the HSE each year refuses a significant number of requests for price increases. Less than 50 price increases were allowed in the 8 years between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>  In October 2012, the manufacturer of Purinethol informed the HSE that, following an examination of the viability of a number of product lines, it had decided to increase the price of Purinethol in Ireland and a number of other EU countries (including Germany, UK, Denmark and Finland). </p><p>  The HSE engaged with the manufacturer in an attempt to negotiate a reduced price, however, the manufacturer was unwilling to do so.  </p><p>  As the manufacturer is the sole supplier of the product in Ireland, the HSE accepted the price increase in order to safeguard the supply of this essential medicine. The HSE granted the price increase with effect from 1 March 2013. Despite this increase, there is still only one supplier of the drug in the Irish market, which suggests that the HSE made the right decision in allowing the price increase in order to maintain supply.</p><p>  It is important to note that the Irish price for Purinethol is not out of line with international prices.</p></reply>
