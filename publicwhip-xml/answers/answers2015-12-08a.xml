It will seek to reinforce the crucial role of culture in society by supporting the cultural sector and providing the conditions which will allow the sector to develop and flourish across all sectors of society. <i>Culture 2025</i>will also seek to reflect the modern multi-cultural Ireland and will be uplifting, accessible, relevant and easy to communicate.</p><p>To facilitate public consultation on the proposed policy, my Department published a discussion document on 8 August last. This was followed up by holding a series of local workshops to enable people across the country to have their views heard. Meetings took place in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Dublin.</p><p>The Dublin event, which I attended, followed the participative &lsquo;world caf&eacute;&rsquo; model and was held under the Open Policy Debates programme, in line with the Civil Service Renewal Plan. I am pleased to inform the House that this event, which was held in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, was an excellent occasion, with a very high level of engagement by those attending. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who participated, as well as those who were involving in organising and running the event.</p><p>Over 600 people attended the consultation events and more than 200 written submissions were received before the closing date of 31<sup></sup>October last. The feedback from the regional meetings and the submissions are currently being examined in detail as part of the process of drafting the cultural policy. An Experts Group and a Steering Group, established by my Department and made up of a range of cultural stakeholders, are also inputting into the consultation and drafting process. </p><p>I intend that <i>Culture 2025</i>will be a high-level and living document that will set out the framework of cultural policy for the next decade. I propose to submit it to Government shortly with the intention of publishing it early in the New Year.</p></reply>

I am very pleased to have secured funding of more than &euro;48m for next year&rsquo;s centenary commemorations. Approximately &euro;30m of this will be allocated to major capital projects. Some of this investment is being concentrated on works at sites which are closely associated with the Easter Rising, such as the major new visitor centre at the GPO and the proposed commemorative centre at the National Monument in Moore Street.  </p>  <p>  The Government has also provided significant capital investment for a new cultural and visitor centre at Pearse&rsquo;s Cottage in Ros Muc, Co. Galway, and for the refurbishment of the Atheneum in Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford. These locations also have strong resonances with the Rising.</p>  <p>  My Department provided &euro;1m this year to assist local authorities in preparing for their own local commemorative programmes and I recently announced a further funding package of &euro;3m for all local authorities in 2016 in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and IPB Insurance. This will be distributed equally across each local authority and will allow communities to fully engage with next year&rsquo;s centenary.</p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting a range of State Ceremonial events across Dublin and in a number of regions across the country, including significant ceremonial events in Enniscorthy, Ashbourne, Athenry, Cork and Kerry.  The Defence Forces are also working closely with local authorities on other ceremonial events taking place next year.  </p>  <p>  With funding also being provided to support a range of events across the 7 strands of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, I am satisfied that all citizens will be able to participate in this major commemoration next year.</p></reply>

My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare. While I understand that there are many individuals opposed to hare coursing there is no current evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations and the decision to issue licences took into consideration the final report of the <i>Status of Hares in Ireland &ndash; Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07</i>. </p><p>In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering their affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2015/16 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2015 to the end of February 2016. To date, officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department have monitored six meetings.  My Department will be examining these reports and, should there be any alleged breaches of licence conditions, these will be followed with the Irish Coursing Club and individual clubs.</p><p>Regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department will continue to attend coursing meetings during the 2015/16 season, as resources allow, to monitor compliance with the conditions of the licences.</p></reply>

Ireland has a reputation for being supportive of artists through the provision of the tax exemption for artists.Income and pension arrangements for artists can vary widely across the sector.  Employment in the arts sector encompasses a wide range of activities.  It can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and encompass areas that flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the industrial creative sectors, including audiovisual production.  </p><p>I was particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the artists' tax exemption for 2015.  This measure recognises the invaluable contribution which arts and culture practitioners make here at home and abroad. </p><p>Aosd&aacute;na was established in 1981 and is a unique State initiative which honours artists whose work has made an outstanding contribution to the arts in Ireland.  There are up to 250 artists who are members of Aosd&aacute;na. A means-tested grant is available to members and is designed to enable them to devote their energies fully to their work.  Artists can also avail of other State supports and payments, subject to the standard eligibility conditions.  </p><p>The Arts Council has recently published its strategy &quot;<i>Making Great Art Work</i>&quot;, which sets out its plans for leading the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade. It has a particular focus on the role of artists.</p><p>Finally, my Department through its support for the Arts Council, the Film Board, and other cultural initiatives also provides significant support for creative workers in Ireland. This year, as part of Budget 2016, I was pleased to announce a 12% increase in allocations across a range of areas, including the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, and a new investment programme for regional arts and cultural centres. There will be significant benefits accruing for artists and creative workers from many of the Ireland 2016 programmes supported by this additional funding, including at an international level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-08a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120800057#WRA01500"><p>My role, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with regard to the protection and management of our built and natural heritage, is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation.  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of the architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures or within a designation of an Architectural Conservation Area (ACA).  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.     I am aware of the important legacy of Industrial Heritage and its role with respect to cultural, heritage and economic development in areas such as Inchicore and Kilmainham and elsewhere throughout the country. Indeed, my Department has recently undertaken a National Inventory of Architectural Heritage for Dublin 8, which has recorded such structures in the area.</p>  <p>  However, I consider that any proposals for Inchicore/Kilmainham to become an industrial heritage hub and/or a cultural/heritage hotspot, or for the setting up of such areas, would be a matter for the relevant Local Authority in the first instance.</p></reply>

This fund, which has an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2015, is administered through the local authorities and encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.

This Directive aims to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. The Habitats Directive has been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.It is recognised that the nomination of a site for designation as a special area of conservation may have an impact on the manner in which certain lands may be farmed. The designation of lands does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions. However, they must be managed appropriately. </p><p>In accordance with the relevant legislation, certain activities in protected sites may only be undertaken with my consent, as Minister. Compensation may be payable where a person has been refused consent by me for a prescribed activity within a designated site that he or she had been undertaking in the five year period prior to the refusal. However, compensation schemes have generally been put in place, where required, without the need to undergo a formal process under the relevant legislation.</p><p>Since this Government has come into office, huge efforts have been made to solve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation, within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included intense and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission.</p><p>A long term compensation scheme has been introduced to compensate turf cutters for their loss arising from the cessation. This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.</p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014. It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. It is expected that this Plan will be finalised early next year.</p><p>Final resolution of all issues in relation to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation will only be brought about by everyone working together, within the law, with my Department and with the Peatlands Council, which was established with the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders.</p><p>The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network<i>, </i>published in January 2014<i>, </i>provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The Review<i></i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p></reply>

The Programme is an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.Officials of my Department have facilitated an intensive consultation period over the last few months, including active engagement with schools, universities, colleges, business and voluntary organisations, arts and culture institutions, historical societies, local authorities and representative groups &ndash; at home and in our Diaspora around the world &ndash; to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about 2016, and to foster programme initiatives. Work has been ongoing to implement a comprehensive programme and planning is well underway for the range of initiatives within the seven programme strands.  </p><p>Among the key milestones achieved to date are the following:</p><p>- I was delighted to host the first of the State ceremonial events of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme on 1August last to commemorate the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin Cemetery, in the presence of President Michael D Higgins and An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D.</p><p>- Over 84 public consultation meetings were held with local communities all around the country. 31 individual county plans were launched on 8October last containing over 1,800 events across the country.  &euro;1m was allocated to facilitate these plans this year, with a further &euro;3m to be made available next year.</p><p>- An allocation of &euro;22 million in capital funding is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015 for the &lsquo;Permanent Reminder&rsquo; projects, with a further &euro;31m being provided next year. These capital projects are progressing well.</p><p>- The Global and Diaspora Programme was launched on 29June and was very positively received at home and abroad.</p><p>- On 6August, the Arts Council announced 9 major arts projects to commemorate 1916.</p><p>- The National Flag Initiative was launched on 14September, marking the commencement of the delivery by the Defence Forces of our National Flag and the Proclamation to over 3,300 national schools across the country.  Well over 2,000 flags have now been delivered and the project has been very well received.</p><p>- The Irish Language strand - An Teanga Bheo- was launched at the end of October by An Taoiseach.</p><p>- The Education Programme strand was launched on 22 September for the primary, post-primary and third-level education sectors.</p><p>-  Consultation is ongoing with relevant stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including official, political, media, artistic and NGO stakeholders.</p><p>- The National Cultural Institutions are planning a range of innovative exhibitions and projects and all are progressing well.  The National Library launched its 2016 plans just yesterday.</p><p>- The official Culture Ireland programme &ldquo;I am Ireland&rdquo; was launched by Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on 3October.

There are significant challenges which will not be fixed overnight, and indeed will most likely take a number of years to address.  </p><p>It is widely acknowledged that the Library holds part of its collection in an historic Victorian-era building in Kildare Street that would not meet modern standards in terms of environmental and other controls.  In this regard, I was delighted to be in a position to announce a major new capital investment plan for the National Library's historic Kildare Street premises, as part of the Government's Public Capital Programme &ndash; <i>Building on Recovery</i>2016-2021. I have earmarked an allocation of &euro;10m in funding for the first phase of the works.</p><p>The investment will be delivered as a phased programme of works in partnership with the Office of Public Works.  The redevelopment will address the following key areas:</p><p>- Refurbishment of the 1890s building to meet modern standards for universal access, fire prevention, health and safety, circulation, security, mechanical and electrical services, and environmental sustainability;</p><p>- Upgrading and enhancement of visitor and reader facilities;</p><p>- Upgrading the conditions in which heritage collections are kept;</p><p>- Improvement of both access and security;</p><p>- Upgrading and rationalisation of operational areas; and</p><p>- Provision of better linkages throughout the Library&rsquo;s extended buildings complex.</p><p>I am confident that investment plan will allow the Library to continue to deliver on its core objectives, including the protection and conservation of its collections, as well as enabling it develop its place as a venue for research, culture, learning and tourism.

Given that the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland have already moved to a 20 year rule, I was cognisant of the importance of maintaining, as far as possible, synchronicity of release of records with the UK and Northern Ireland, especially in regard to Anglo-Irish matters.In particular, the Government agreed to:</p><p>- reduce from 30 years to 20 years the time limit for the deposit of Departmental records with the National Archives of Ireland;</p><p>- implement the change on a phased basis, starting with the Departments of An Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Justice and Equality;</p><p>- extend the reduction to other Departments as resources permit; and</p><p>- engage with Government Departments to deal with the current backlog of records over 30 years old, which have not yet been transferred to the National Archives. </p><p>These changes will be implemented following the enactment of the relevant legislation to amend the National Archives Act 1986.

The purpose of the reintroduction project was to bring back eagles to Ireland, restoring a species that had been persecuted in the late 19th   Century. The golden eagle was present in Glenveagh until 1910.</p>  <p>  Experts on eagles in Scotland visited Glenveagh, by then a National Park, in the 1990s, and considered that the habitats in north Donegal were suitable for a reintroduction programme.  61 birds, sourced as chicks in Scotland, were released in Glenveagh between 2001 and 2012.  The original plan was to release 75 birds over five years but it became increasingly difficult to find suitable donor stock in Scotland, resulting in fewer releases over a longer time span than originally planned.</p>  <p>  Using data from radio and satellite tags and wing tags fitted to the released birds, it was established that some birds moved around Ireland and some even returned to Scotland. Some birds are known to have died of natural causes but 3 of the 10 satellite-tagged birds were poisoned, two in Donegal and one in Northern Ireland. My Department produces annual reports on all known cases of mortality and persecution of birds of prey.</p>  <p>  The re-introduced eagles have nested over a number of years, and in 2014 and 2015 there were 3 known nests. However, breeding success has not been as good as anticipated. Sometimes, as is the case in 2015, this may be due to adverse weather at critical stages during nesting. However, as has been pointed out by the Golden Eagle Trust in recent weeks, there may also be issues to do with habitat quality and the amount of food prey available in the landscape. </p>  <p>  There are many factors at play in matters concerning the ecology and behaviour of the golden eagle. Certainly, large-scale burning, as has occurred in recent years, is a factor in reducing habitat quality. Such burning poses a threat to property and forestry as well as to wildlife, and my Department is working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to reduce this problem.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Golden Eagle Trust will meet in the coming weeks to review the performance of the project to date and will examine what genuinely effective options are available in the short and medium term. My Department will then be in a position to decide if further discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in regard to agri-environment measures would be useful.</p></reply>

Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfires. This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the spate of fires in various parts of the country, including Co. Kerry, last spring.  The main source of such wildfires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.    My Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group that explores issues surrounding such fires.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is also represented on the Group, leads any criminal investigation. My Department, of course, cooperates fully with Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, my Department has taken over 40 prosecutions against individuals for breaches of section 40 of the Wildlife Acts. Fines were imposed in most cases, ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;600.   In some cases, the defendants were also ordered by the Court to pay legal costs and expenses.  </p>  <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised officers to prosecute breaches of the Wildlife Acts. My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of wild fires which have affected Killarney National Park and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate action under the Wildlife Act or other legislation.</p></reply>

Significant remains of the trackway still survive within the developed bog and it is likely that substantial parts also survive in adjacent intact areas of the bog.    My Department, through the relevant development control frameworks and in co-operation with the landowner, is pursuing an archaeological response in this case that is based on preservation in-situ of those parts of the trackway, where it is a realistic option, and preservation by record, where it is no longer viable. </p>  <p>  Most recently in that context, my Department submitted a set of archaeological observations, with three specific recommendations in relation to the trackway, to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in connection with an Integrated Pollution Control licence application to the Agency earlier this year for peat extraction at Mayne Bog.  The form and extent of the archaeological excavation sought by my Department was directly comparable to the archaeological mitigation strategies adopted in relation to similar monuments on Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands.</p>  <p>  The archaeological investigations recommended by my Department to the EPA have since been carried out by the landowner under a separate licence I granted, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930. The works were inspected and verified at the time by my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service. </p>  <p>  A report on the investigations has since been received by my Department and is being examined. My Department will, inter alia, liaise with the landowner in relation to any further archaeological work on the trackway that it determines from the report as being necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

These are important publicly owned recreational corridors which support a wide range of boating and water sports. The canal towpaths represent opportunities for both local communities and tourists to enjoy off-road cycling and walking while enjoying the built and natural heritage of these resources.   Waterways Ireland works in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders, including local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the National Roads Authority, the National Trails Office and local communities to develop and enhance the towpaths along the canals in its care. </p>  <p>In Dublin, a programme to upgrade the towpaths into premium walking and cycleways has been ongoing for a number of years.

There will be significant benefits accruing for artists and creative workers from many of the Ireland 2016 programmes supported by this additional funding, including at an international level.</p><p>I was also particularly pleased that the Government introduced a 25% increase in the ceiling for the Artists Exemption from 2015.  This important measure recognises the invaluable contribution which artists make to Irish society. The feedback available to me indicates that artists very much welcome the increase in the exemption limits.  The scheme ensures that Ireland continues to be a place where the work of artists is valued.</p><p>My Department continues to work with other Departments to promote the cultural and creative industries within the framework of the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>Finally, the place of artists in society has been a significant theme arising from the public consultation process, which I put in place for the development of Ireland's first national cultural policy, <i>Culture 2025</i>.  This will be reflected in the policy document which I will publish early in the New Year.</p></reply>

This fund, which has an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2015, is administered through the local authorities and encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  This fund, which is now closed, was open to two applications per local authority. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources. The announcement of any proposed grant schemes can be monitored on </p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p><p>The recently announced new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures &ndash; the Built Heritage Investment Scheme &ndash; will operate, via the Local Authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.  </p><p>It seeks to encourage the investment of private capital in a number of small-scale, labour intensive projects to repair and conserve historic structures and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craft workers and tradespeople.  Protected structures, proposed protected structures and structures that contribute to the character of an Architectural Conservation Area will be eligible for assistance. </p><p>The minimum level of funding awarded will be &euro;2,500 with up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 generally applicable, while up to a maximum of &euro;15,000 will be available to the 6 city local authorities. The State&rsquo;s contribution to each project must be matched by a similar contribution from the private sector per application. The scheme will operate through 2016 and will be administered by the local authorities, all of which have been informed of their allocations and the process and timelines involved. </p><p>With respect to 2016, my Department is currently finalising its consideration of the funding available for the protection and conservation of the built heritage next year in the context of its overall allocations. I will publish details of the funding schemes for 2016 as soon as these are finalised.</p></reply>

I have also recognised that these Houses are often a hugely important resource for local communities and a vital attraction for tourists, which can and do contribute significantly to the local economy.

An Experts Group and a Steering Group, established by my Department and made up of a range of cultural stakeholders, are also inputting into the consultation and drafting process. </p><p>I intend that <i>Culture 2025</i>will be a high-level and living document that will set out the framework of cultural policy for the next decade.

Significant environmental damage is caused by wildfires. This issue has become more acute in recent years, as evidenced by the spate of fires in various parts of the country, including Co. Kerry, last spring.  The main source of such wildfires is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences.    My Department is one of a number of agencies represented on the Inter-Agency Gorse Fire Group that explores issues surrounding such fires.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is also represented on the Group, leads any criminal investigation. My Department, of course, cooperates fully with Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, my Department has taken over 40 prosecutions against individuals for breaches of section 40 of the Wildlife Acts. Fines were imposed in most cases, ranging from &euro;50 to &euro;600.   In some cases, the defendants were also ordered by the Court to pay legal costs and expenses.  </p>  <p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised officers to prosecute breaches of the Wildlife Acts. My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of wild fires which have affected Killarney National Park and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate action under the Wildlife Act or other legislation.</p></reply>

One of the PRSI conditions is that a person must have a minimum of 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year. Claims made in 2015 are governed by the 2013 tax year, and only PRSI Classes A, E, H, and P are reckonable for illness benefit purposes.</p>  <p>  The person concerned made an application for illness benefit from 19 Oct 2015 and has an entitlement to illness benefit at the graduated personal weekly rate of &euro;147.30 based on weekly earnings of &euro;231.29 in 2013 . They also qualify for payment of qualified child allowance at the rate of &euro;59.60. The total weekly entitlement is &euro;206.90.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the time the application for illness benefit was made.   Supplementary welfare allowance is a means tested payment and it was necessary to offset any arrears of illness benefit against the amount paid by way of supplementary allowance.  This has now been done and illness benefit payment issued to the bank account of the person concerned on 23/11/15.</p></reply>

However social welfare fraud undermines public confidence in the entire social protection system as well as being unfair to other recipients of social welfare payments and to taxpayers.  Control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is one of the three key functions of the Department and therefore has been one of my priorities since I came to the Department.  </p><p>The Department has made some significant inroads in tackling social welfare fraud.  In April of 2014 the Department published a new Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The new strategy builds on the approach and progress made under the previous Initiative.</p><p>Enhanced access channels - both online and dedicated phone lines - are available to citizens who wish to report incidences of welfare fraud.  Citizens who wish to report suspected incidences of welfare fraud can do so both online and to dedicated phone lines as follows:</p><p>-By email: </p><p>-By phone: (01) 6732123 or (071) 9672648  orLocall: 1890 927999.</p><p>-By Post: </p><p>Central Control Division, DSP, Shannon Lodge, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim.</p><p>A payment is not suspended or stopped solely on the basis of an anonymous report. The anonymous report, however, may be a &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; for the instigation of a review of a customer&rsquo;s entitlement.  All anonymous or confidential reports received are examined and where relevant, are referred for follow-up action.  A total of 12,787 reports were dealt with by the Department&rsquo;s Control Division from January - October 2015.  </p><p>There are no plans to undertake a national print media advertising campaign encouraging members of the public to report social welfare fraud at this time.  It should be borne in mind that there is often a perception of fraud however when a case is examined the individual may be doing something that is allowed under the rules for the particular payment that they are in receipt of e.g. working and receiving a OPF payment provided earnings are within the limits and the Department is aware of the situation is legitimate.</p></reply>

The Department ensures that all cases that merit prosecution are forwarded for consideration of legal proceedings and must ensure that all necessary evidential proofs are available.</p>  <p>  In considering, or when referring, cases of social welfare fraud for legal proceedings the Department applies defined and recognised best practice standards.  This includes the duration of the fraud, amount overpaid, and previous incidences of social welfare fraud.</p>  <p>  In 2013, a total of 275 cases were referred for legal proceedings; of which 207 (198 criminal and 9 civil) were sent to the Chief State Solicitors Office/DPP and a further 68 cases were referred to the Garda for consideration of criminal proceedings to be taken under the Criminal Justice (Fraud and Theft) Act 2001. </p>  <p>  The corresponding figures for 2014 were 321 cases, of which 206 (201 criminal and 5 civil) cases were sent directly to the Chief State Solicitors Office//DPP and 115 cases were referred to the Garda.</p>  <p>  As at the end of October 2015, the Department had sent a total of 146 cases to the Chief State Solicitors Office//DPP.  The number of cases referred to the Garda for prosecution under Criminal Justice legislation will be collated at the end of the year.  The overall total for 2015 is expected to be similar to previous years.</p>  <p>  The Courts are totally independent of the State and Judges have the discretion to decide on the appropriate penalty to be applied in any case having regard to the evidence presented to them in relation to the case and the relevant maximum penalties.</p></reply>

The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. Analysis shows that increasing the current rent limits nationwide by 5% would result in a full year cost in excess of &euro;15 million; a 10% increase would carry a cost of almost &euro;32 million, with a 15% increase costing approximately &euro;51 million. A breakdown of this cost on a county basis is not available; however, as an approximation, the costs to apply such an increase in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford regions, would account for approximately 70% of the total share of increased costs for the scheme. Though the costing model accurately reflects the increased cost for the scheme, the likelihood is that increased supply would not be achieved as the market would adjust to the revised rent limits.  </p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits. Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. As part of this flexible approach the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues have been particularly acute. Plans are actively underway to extend this Protocol to Galway City.   This approach has assisted over 5,400 households nationwide to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent payments. </p>  <p>  I believe that these measures and the reforms to the private rental sector announced in November will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure. Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year. The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million in 2015 for the increasing number of pensioners. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million, and with the year-on-year increase in the number of people qualifying for the household benefits package, this yearly saving will increase. These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The Department will spend approx. &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way. In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week. This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30. I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week. I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of this Budget will be very positive for older people.</p></reply>

The electricity and gas allowance is currently &euro;35 per month.  There have been no reductions to this allowance in recent budgets.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. </p>  <p>  Changes were made to the household benefits package and fuel scheme during 2011. These changes were provided for in Budget 2011, which was introduced by the previous Government, but details were not specified at the time.  The number of free units provided under the electricity and gas allowance was reduced to the level at the start of 2007 (from 2,400 to 1,800).  This change was effective from September 2011. Estimated savings for this measure at that time were &euro;29.8 million per year.  As this benefit is now delivered by means of a cash amount, rather than the purchase of a set number of units, my Department is no longer in a position to state the actual saving this particular change will deliver in 2015.</p>  <p>  Effective from April 2012, new applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, who are not living with the person for whom they are providing care, are not entitled to household benefits.  It is estimated that this affects approximately 1,000 people in a full year, yielding an estimated saving of approximately &euro;420,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the electricity and gas allowance was aligned with the cheapest available market rate for 1,800 units of electricity. Previously the rate had been based on the price of one supplier.

Funding is provided in the form of a financial contribution for the employment of staff to deliver the service.  The CSP became operational in 2006 absorbing a previous programme operated by F&Aacute;S including a grant structure linked to the minimum wage.  Any such link is historic given that many current contracts have been in place for at least nine years and the wage levels in service providers have increased.  The grant structure was remodelled in 2009/10 in response to the financial crisis with the value of the full-time equivalent wage element maintained at &euro;19,033 per annum only.  The programme has never provided full funding for wages.  The rules of the programme require service providers to pay the local rate for equivalent employment, which is generally well in excess of minimum wage levels.  Contracts of up to three years duration are available to service providers that continue to deliver needed services and demonstrate an ability to generate and maintain income from other sources for the services delivered. </p><p>The level of grant support available from the CSP contributes no more than a third of aggregate turnover of the community companies in contract.  It has been at all time clear that the CSP represents a contribution only to the cost of employment. The service providers undertake to generate additional revenue from the services they deliver to support the adequate remuneration of staff employed and to provide for overhead, operational and future development costs.Pobal is engaged by the Department to provide contract management and financial oversight and compliance services.  Currently, the value of CSP contracts is just under &euro;42 million providing a contribution to 2,111.5 full time equivalent positions.  The Department estimates that 2,800 people are directly supported in employment by the CSP contribution when part-time work is taken into consideration.  An estimated 300-500 additional employees are supported indirectly from income generated from activities and other public resources provided to the companies.</p><p><b>TABLE</b></p><p><b>CSP CONTRACT VALUES &amp;amp; NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION - 2015</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Contract Value in 2015 &euro;</th><th>Number of employee supported*</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>460,006</td><td>29.5</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>593,474</td><td>30.5</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1,235,233</td><td>103.5</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>2,442,724</td><td>142.5</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>3,099,650</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>8,461,604</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>1,997,959</td><td>89.5</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2,170,212</td><td>111.5</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>429,078</td><td>20.5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>371,979</td><td>17.5</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>343,429</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1,355,167</td><td>62.5</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1,156,035</td><td>54.5</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>480,660</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1,350,046</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>3,419,506</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>928,221</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1,074,419</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1,109,870</td><td>51.5</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>2,200,322</td><td>102.5</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>661,309</td><td>30.5</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>688,858</td><td>37.5</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>712,924</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,110,419</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2,281,026</td><td>126.5</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1,829,508</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>41,963,638</td><td>2111.5</td></tr></table>* Includes contribution to manager position, if employed.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the programme as part of Budget 2016, bringing the total allocation to &euro;42 million in 2016. </p><p>The Department initiated an inspection programme in 2012 consisting of on-site inspections in participating schools to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to. This inspection process will be rolled out to all schools over the next 3 year period and the Department has assigned additional resources to facilitate this work. A breakdown of on-site inspections by county since 2012 is provided in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>Some 246 schools and organisations have been examined and finalised to date under inspection programme since 2012. The results show a relatively high rate of compliance by funded organisations / schools with the conditions of the scheme. 208 schools (85%) were found to be operating satisfactorily. In 31 schools, (13%), less serious issues such as non-compliance with scheme rules or errors involving minor amounts were discovered; and serious issues were identified in two schools.  These serious issues have been reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Schools/groups must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of each school year. Any expenditure on non-food items and unhealthy foods is deducted from the following year&rsquo;s allocation. </p><p>Overpayments are raised as appropriate and agreed recovery arrangements are in place with schools. These arrangements are being monitored and are being adhered to. There is a balance to be maintained by the Department in terms of restricting payments to schools while continuing to provide for a service for the children therein.  </p><p>A further 143 schools and organisations were examined in 2015.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as the costs would be significant. In addition, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. </p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p></reply>

The community centre operates a schedule of social and entertainment events and activities.  Financial support was provided to contribute to the employment of a manager and two full time equivalent positions plus &euro;4,000 in 2015 to support operations.  A recent review of the service concluded that the company was well run but raised concerns about its future financial viability and income levels to sustain current operations.  Additionally, the review noted that the level of resources provided by the CSP was high in comparison with other similar services.  User levels were low leading to a conclusion that good value for money was not being achieved.  The Department accepted a recommendation that the funding level should be set to contribute to the cost of supporting two full-time equivalent positions to operate the community facilities.  The outcome of the contract review was communicated to the company and no request was received to seek a review of this determination.</p></reply>

The number of clients assigned to an individual Case Officer will vary according to local circumstances and activities.  As newly unemployed Jobseekers are a priority cohort for activation and case management, local inflow to the Live Register is a key factor in relation to the numbers of such clients requiring referral to individual Case Officers.  Unemployed jobseekers aged under 25 also have access to dedicated measures, such as JobsPlus Youth (recruitment subsidy) and First Steps Youth Developmental Internship.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of Case Officers are Higher Executive Officers.

However deductions are not taken from Jobseekers Allowance as the temporary and intermittent nature of the allowance could result in shortfalls in the amount of LPT deducted leaving property owners with outstanding liabilities at year-end.</p><p>In cases where LPT cannot be deducted from DSP payments, there are other phased payment options available to assist property owners in spreading the liability over the course of the year.  These options include monthly Direct Debits through banks and certain credit union accounts and flexible payments through four approved Payment Service Providers including An Post, Payzone, Omnivend and PayPoint.  Each of these service providers applies various transaction charges that are outside of Revenue's control.</p><p>Also, Part 12 of the LPT Act provides for 'Deferral', and 'Partial Deferral' (50%) schemes that may apply to property owners under certain conditions including, 'Income Level', 'Hardship', 'Personal Insolvency' and 'Personal Representative of a Deceased Person'.  The income thresholds for a full deferral are &euro;15,000 (single person) per annum and &euro;25,000 (couple) per annum and for a partial deferral are &euro;25,000 (single person) per annum or &euro;35,000 (couple) per annum.  These thresholds can also be increased by 80% of any gross mortgage interest payments.  However, 'Deferral' and 'Partial Deferral' are not exemptions and the tax becomes payable at a later date and carries an annual interest rate of 4%.</p><p>Finally, any property owners who are no longer making LPT payments by Deduction at Source from their DSP payments or, who wish to apply for a 'Deferral' or 'Partial Deferral', can access their records online at <i></i>and amend the payment instruction as required.  Alternatively they can contact the LPT Helpline at 1890200255 where an agent will confirm any balances due and assist with making alternative payment arrangements, including Deferral/Partial Deferral as necessary.</p></reply>

However it is important to note that where transactions occur in intellectual property in a particular period, in general the impact on GDP is zero.  This is because in the national accounts these investment transactions give rise to an increase in investment, which adds to GDP, as well as an offsetting increase in imports.  In contrast, R&amp;D created solely in Ireland will add to GDP in the same period.  Of course, acquired intellectual property assets are expected to generate future income streams and increase GDP into the future.  In Ireland because of the substantial presence of Multi-National Corporations, transactions of this nature in intellectual property occur frequently enough.  It is important to stress that the contribution of this intellectual property transaction to overall investment or imports in the second quarter cannot be calculated with precision with publicly available data.  The Deputy will be aware that due to confidentiality reasons the CSO are not in a position to comment on firm specific developments.  In fact, the Statistics Act 1993 restricts the use of information supplied to the CSO solely to statistical purposes and prohibits identifying the undertakings which supply this information.</p></reply>

The use of marked mineral oil in the fuel tank of a private car is an offence under Section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  The penalty for this offence, prescribed in Section 102 of the Act, is a fine of &euro;5,000, on summary conviction.

These arrangements have been in place for many years.</p>  <p>  Where it is determined that a case is suitable to be dealt with by way of a compromise penalty in lieu of legal proceedings, Revenue will write to the offender indicating that they are disposed to deal with the offence in that way.

These include the use of detector dog teams, X-ray and other technology on one hand and intelligence development and profiling on the other.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners have advised me that they have changed their procedures for dealing with persons suspected of ingesting controlled drugs as a result of two Supreme Court judgements dealing with the right to due process for persons detained.  Consequently, Customs Officers are no longer seeking the provision of urine samples on a voluntary basis.  No other aspect of the work is impacted by the judgements and Officers are still detecting ingested drugs.  Tests involving biological samples have a very high requirement for specialist handling in order to be of value as evidence while protecting the rights of the person concerned.  Revenue is satisfied that the present arrangements, which include inter-agency co-operation in appropriate cases, enable good detection rates at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer.

Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff countrywide engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.</p><p>There are currently over 800 Revenue staff serving in the Border, Midlands, West Region, of which approximately 127 are engaged on these activities in the North West area.</p><p>Revenue has provided me with the following information in relation to drug detections in the Border Midlands West Region:</p><p>BORDER MIDLANDS WEST REGION DRUG SEIZURES <table><tr><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th></tr><tr><td>474</td><td>184</td><td>84</td><td>73</td><td>73</td><td>68</td><td>56</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that as part of its risk focused approach to the discharge of its role in this area, harbours and inlets along the coastline are monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis from the point of view of the potential for smuggling.  This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, which incorporates a Coastal and Airfield reporting mechanism.  This allows members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities etc. to notify us in confidence of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast through our confidential 24/7 Drugs Watch free phone facility.  Revenue is very active in the area of targeting and combatting drugs smuggling and is committed to playing an active role, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, in working against this criminal activity and those responsible for it.</p><p>Revenue has an enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations throughout the country and place particular emphasis on developing an intelligence-based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk.  Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.</p></reply>

However, based on the information that is available and making certain assumptions, it is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer of increasing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 100%, could be in the order of &euro;80 million. </p>  <p>  This estimate is premised on the assumption that tax relief is allowed at the Income Tax rate of 40% and the figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings and the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in Corporation Tax returns.  There is, therefore, no basis for an estimate of the cost of increasing the tax relief for corporate landlords.</p>  <p>  The restriction was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget in respect of all residential lettings as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  As the Deputy will be aware, in the current Finance Bill I am providing for a full 100% interest deduction where the landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of providing 100% mortgage relief to all new landlords, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no information on either the likely number of new landlords or the level of mortgage interest relief they might claim.  There is therefore no basis upon which to estimate the cost of the measure proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and their concerns around the new regulations were discussed.  Officials from my Department have also met with the sector.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  Separately to the consultation process, as outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted and given further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.  On finalisation of the application process, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions in making an application.  It is anticipated that application forms will be available this month.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for retaining savings of over &euro;100,000 and I also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.  It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating  this review and this is currently under consideration by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments regarding this matter.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that all credit unions were contacted and invited to attend information seminars being held around the country from mid to end November.  These seminars provided credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank  on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model, including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.  </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  Qualifying expenditure is that which is subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;4,405 (exclusive of VAT) at which level it would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply.  The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.</p><p>As the HRI is a tax relief, it is not possible to extend it to individuals who have no tax liability.  However, the tax credit is being provided over a period of two years in order to assist those with low incomes.  In addition, unused credits may be carried forward for use in future years, should an individual subsequently have an income level which is liable to income tax.</p><p>It is worth noting that the SEAI operates the Better Energy Homes Scheme where cash grants are provided for qualifying works.  The SEAI also install energy efficiency measures at no cost to qualifying individuals under the Warmer Homes Scheme.  Further information on these schemes is available on the SEAI website, .  In addition to the grants available from the SEAI, grants are also provided by local authorities to assist individuals in the carrying out of works that are necessary to accommodate the needs of a person with a disability.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-08a.352.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120800062#WRF02300"><p>I welcome the announcement by NAMA that, subject to commercial viability, it expects to be in a position to fund the construction of up to 20,000 new residential units, predominantly located in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, over the next five years.  NAMA will in this way make an important contribution, on a strictly commercial basis, to increased supply over the coming years and will be part of the overall housing solution, although only one part of the solution.   </p>  <p>  NAMA debtors and receivers control about 30% of zoned residential sites in the Dublin area.  Accordingly, market participants who control the other 70% of the sites also have a major role to play in addressing the supply/demand imbalance in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  This Government is examining what role it can play in supporting increased output by the wider development sector and in particular is examining how to address infrastructure deficits that are holding up the supply of commercially viable new housing in the main urban growth centres.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged by the increasingly visible activity of other market participants as demonstrated by the recent announcement by Cairn Homes that their successful acquisition of Ulster Bank's Project Clear portfolio will provide them with the opportunity to build over 14,000 new homes, with an expected net development value of in excess of &euro;2 billion. </p>  <p>  The Deputy rightly identifies increased social housing provision as a priority for Government.  That priority is reflected in the housing package announced recently by Minister Alan Kelly and in the substantial increases in direct Exchequer funding for social housing over the lifetime of this Government.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding will only be made available if it is expected to increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.  NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity.</p>  <p>  NAMA has, however, already played a very important role in facilitating on a commercial basis the supply of houses and apartments for social housing from within its existing portfolio.  By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers.  This equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V (Social Housing) legislation in the years between 2002 and 2011.  It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.</p>  <p>  Therefore, NAMA's contribution to the housing market and, by association, social housing, is certainly both timely and welcome.  The core housing issue that we currently face is that of insufficient supply.  It is only by substantially increasing housing supply, particularly in the greater Dublin area, that we can deliver a sustainable solution to the current housing situation.  By increasing the level of housing output, we will increase the affordability of housing generally, which in turn will have a positive effect on our ability to provide social housing. </p>  <p>  NAMA continues to be mindful of commercially attractive opportunities in the social housing sector.  However, the reality is that current social housing delivery models require direct Exchequer subvention.  The Government is fully committed to delivering on our Social Housing 2020 strategy, which will provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion over the period to 2020. </p>  <p>  We are also combining these long terms measures with interim solutions to deal with the immediate issues that families currently face.  This is why Budget 2016 increased the current allocation for social housing by &euro;69 million to &euro;414 million.  This will enable local authorities to secure accommodation for an additional 14,000 households. </p>  <p>  Under the Government's 6 year capital investment framework, "Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021", which was recently announced by Minister Howlin, the current allocation for emergency accommodation for the homeless, has been increased by &euro;17 million.  This increase will bring Exchequer support to &euro;70 million, which amounts to a 56% increase since last year.  This injection of funding will help the homeless transition to long term sustainable housing.</p>  <p>  The Government also recently agreed on a package of measures designed to give certainty to tenants in relation to their rent, to better protect tenants in their homes and to provide clarity to both tenants and landlords as regards their rights and obligations.  The primary measure in this package is the amendment of the Residential Tenancies Act so that rent reviews for all tenancies will take place every 24 months, rather than every 12 months as currently is the case.  This will provide tenants with a longer period of predictable rent. </p>  <p>  Therefore, addressing the issues facing the housing market generally, social housing, and homelessness, particularly among families, are clearly key priorities for this Government.  The above measures are tangible evidence of our commitment to tackle those issues head on.</p></reply>

The SFT is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million in 2010 and further reduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 January 2014.</p>  <p>  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to either the Revenue Commissioners or to my Department by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  The estimate of the yield expected to arise from the changes to the SFT regime introduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 referred to above was arrived at following considerable internal work over a period by my Department involving, among other things, data gathering and consultation with private sector sources relating to the specific changes to be made.  There is no readily available underlying data or methodology on which to base reliable estimates of the tax yield that would arise from further changes to the SFT of the scale envisaged in the question.</p></reply>

There are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid.  These include, for example, the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income.  It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing rental income for tax purposes.  This guide is available at:  <i>.</i></p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in the current Finance Bill I am providing for a full 100% interest deduction where the landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits. </p><p>I am conscious of the challenges that individuals continue to face, despite the improving economic conditions.  However I would also note that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and or USC in 2014 are facing reduced tax bills in 2015, where incomes are equal.  Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.</p></reply>

This legislation provided for the commencement of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  This was a significant reform and targeted <font color="#2F2F2F">very substantial long-run savings of about one third of pension outgo, for new-hire workers across entire public service, with foreseen savings mainly deriving from career-average (not final-salary) pension accrual, inflation (not pay) linkage of benefits, and higher minimum pension age. </font>Accordingly any increase in the minimum pension age can deliver reduced pension costs to the Exchequer.  However, while the Scheme linked normal pension age with the age of qualification for the State Contributory Pension <font color="#2F2F2F">(effectively 68 years for most new joiners), </font>the Scheme currently includes a maximum retirement age of 70.  The Scheme also recognises that f<font color="#2F2F2F">or certain roles, such as members of the fire brigade, prison service, the Permanent Defence Force or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the maximum retirement age may be lower.</font></p><p>For public servants who are  members of pre-existing pension schemes other than the Single Pension Scheme, responsibility for conditions in respect of occupational pension and any maximum or compulsory retirement ages in particular areas of the public service are in general a matter for the relevant employer, pension administrator or Government Department in the first instance. <font color="#2F2F2F"> I understand that public servants, in general, who began employment in a public service body prior to 1 April 2004 normally have a maximum retirement age of 65 under their terms and conditions of employment.</font>However, similar to the Single Pension Scheme,  the maximum retirement age can be lower for certain grades.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Any consideration of changes in existing age related compulsory retirement date(s) for public servants would need to have regard to the operational and other requirements of the relevant services across the public service, existing  terms and conditions including pension provision and entitlements of the public servants concerned, workforce planning issues and impacts on the Exchequer.</font></p></reply>

When fully rolled-out from 1 January 2018, this means that all public service pensions in payment with pre-PSPR values of up to &euro;34,132 will be fully exempt from PSPR, while those pensioners not fully removed from the reach of PSPR will, in general, benefit by &euro;1,680 per year.  Accordingly, all PSPR impacted pensioners including those on pensions in excess of &euro;34,132 will benefit from the measures but those on lower income pensions will benefit proportionately more.  The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018. </p><p>I believe that the current PSPR ameliorative measures represent a fair and sound basis on which, in the improved but still constrained fiscal space, public service pension reductions may be restored  in a phased, moderate and progressive fashion, with those on lower PSPR impacted pensions benefitting to a greater extent. </p><p>Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  In that context, economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of the possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures, including the PSPR.</p></reply>

To this end I established a Social Clauses Project Group in 2014, led by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to proactively look at public contracts where social clauses could be deployed to contribute to employment or training opportunities for long term unemployed.  The objectives of this project group are: </p>  <p>  -	the identification of suitable policy priorities to be addressed through the insertion of social clauses in public contracts;</p>  <p>  -	the provision of guidance in relation to suitable candidate project types and spend areas;</p>  <p>  -	identification of suitable contract clauses developed in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's Office; and,</p>  <p>  -	the design of a monitoring and reporting framework which can be applied to future projects where social clauses are to be used. </p>  <p>  It is important to adopt a targeted approach to the use of community benefit clauses on contracts where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.  This is likely to mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  Two examples of this approach currently in progress are the Grangegorman Development and Devolved Schools Build Programme.  In relation to the latter, a clause has been included in the Public Works contracts which require that</p>  <p>  -	10% of the aggregate time worked on site to have been undertaken by individuals who have been registered on a national unemployment register within the EU for a continuous period of at least 12 months immediately prior to their employment on the project.</p>  <p>  -	2.5% of the aggregate time worked on site to have been undertaken by individuals who are employed under a registered scheme of apprenticeship or other similar national, accredited training or educational work placement arrangement.</p>  <p>  Experience of this pilot have been positive.  It is important to learn from such practical experience of where community benefit clauses are utilised.  This is a complex area.  It is important to develop a robust structure that will assist the contracting authority to develop the correct clause and to provide the support from the appropriate agency to aid the company in implementing the clause.  I have instructed the OGP to report on this issue and to issue practical guidance designed to assist Contracting Authorities to carry out this important role in a consistent manner.  I expect both the report and guidance to issue shortly.</p></reply>

There are thousands of contracting authorities in the State and they are individually responsible for retaining the tender documentation for each procurement procedure that they carry out. Therefore the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the use of social clauses and the wording of each social clause is not available as such information is not collected centrally. </p><p>As part of the reform of the public procurement function the Office of Government Procurement has initiated measures to make it easier for contracting authorities to carry out public procurement in a consistent manner. One such measure was the introduction of standard procurement template documents that are used throughout the public service. These template documents make it easier for suppliers particularly SMEs to take advantage of public procurement opportunities. In relation to Social Clauses these template documents already provide for the inclusion of clauses in a number of wider policy areas that would include the following:</p><p>- Taxation and Social insurance payments</p><p>- Employment legislation</p><p>- Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005</p><p>- Waste management</p><p>- Human Rights</p><p>- Environmental legislation</p><p>Government recognises the valuable contribution that a vibrant construction sector makes to the economic and social well-being of the State and has introduced a range of measures as set out in Construction 2020A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector. In order to ensure that these stimulus packages generate the maximum return in relation to job creation social clauses are included in the various contracts that have been, and will be, awarded under the PPP element of the &euro;2.25bn package announced in July 2012.  The relevant clause requires:</p><p>- At least 10% of the working hours necessary to complete the projects are undertaken by those recruited from the live register who have been unemployed for more than 12 months; and</p><p>- At least 2.5% of the working hours necessary to complete the projects are undertaken by individuals who are engaged in an approved registered apprenticeship, training or educational work placement scheme.</p><p>Overall compliance in relation to the pilot clause has been good. The Department of Social Protection and their local Intreo offices are working closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative and there has been strong positive engagement from the contractors involved in each of the projects. </p><p>Whilst Government is convinced of the merit in using social clauses in particular circumstances, it is important that contracting authorities are not compelled to use them on every contract particularly where their deployment may disproportionately impact on SME's bidding for public contracts.</p></reply>

A Steering Group which comprises representatives of KCC, OPW and the consultants, was set up to advance the project.</p>  <p>  KCC and their consultants submitted a Draft Options Report/Feasibility Study to OPW outlining possible flood relief measures for the Lower Morrell River Catchment in 2014.  Following consideration of the draft report by the OPW, it was agreed by the Steering Group that the consultants would carry out a more detailed review of the proposed scheme with further analysis of the various options considered to assess the benefits of the current works proposals as they have evolved.  The review would also investigate if there are additional or alternative and more cost effective measures that can be put in place to alleviate flooding in the area.  Any changes identified by the review process would need to be incorporated into the Cost Benefit Analysis and Environmental Impact Statement before the scheme can be advanced.</p>  <p>  I am advised by my Officials that the consultants have completed the review process and KCC has submitted their findings to the OPW for consideration. It is envisaged that OPW and KCC  will meet early in 2016 with a view to finalising the Feasibility Report.  Once the Feasibility Report has been finalised, and provided the scheme is still economically and environmentally viable, KCC and the OPW will decide on how best to advance the proposed works.  The OPW has included provision for the cost of the proposed works in its financial profiles in the period up to 2018.</p></reply>

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies, employing 1,874 people in the county. Companies supported by IDA Ireland in Kerry added 361 additional new jobs between 2011&ndash;2014 compared to 502 job losses in the period 2008 &ndash; 2010.  It should be noted that 70% of new IDA jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.As part of its efforts to market Ireland and its different business locations, IDA Ireland continues to explore marketing opportunities based on the key criteria used by companies to assess different locations. In relation to County Kerry, IDA Ireland is actively exploring the potential of different digital marketing initiatives.  The agency is also keen to work in partnership with other stakeholders in the delivery of effective marketing of Kerry as a location for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). In this regard, a number of stakeholders, not limited to IDA Ireland have an active role to play in making this happen.</p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for FDI is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland although the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the companies themselves.</p><p>IDA Ireland launched its new five-year strategy entitled <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019</i>in April of this year. The strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.  Tralee is to be the site of one such advanced technology building.</p><p>Finally, a further boost to the county is the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, which came into force on 1July, 2014. The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. The funding for this comes from the Exchequer. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.</p></reply>

A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties. </p><p>The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004. It is now the case that a person of any age, when dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts unless she or he has reached the &ldquo;normal retiring age for employees of the same employer in similar employment&rdquo;, if one exists. In such circumstances, the burden of proof is<b></b>on the employer to prove the normal retiring age. Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007. </p><p>As the issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds, the more usual avenue of redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim, under the Employment Equality Acts, to the Workplace Relations Commission.  </p><p>Responsibility for employment equality legislation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  As the Deputy is aware, Minister Fitzgerald is currently bringing the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill amends Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts to bring it fully into line with Framework Directive 2000/78/EC and the interpretation of that Directive by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU rulings provide that it is not unlawful for an employer to fix a compulsory retirement age for employees provided it can be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. </p><p>Issues around retirement age generally are very complex and require a Whole-of Government approach.  In addition to the issues set out above they also raises significant issues in respect of pensions policy and the State Pension Age which come within the remit of the Minister for Social Protection.  Retirement age issues have been brought into sharp focus by the ending of the State Pension (Transition) and the standardising of the State pension age at 66.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently conducting a preliminary analysis of the issues involved, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform intends to bring a Memorandum to Government in due course.</p></reply>

For the first time, ambitious investment targets have been set for each region, with a strong focus on securing a significant uplift in the number of investments. Central to this is a driving ambition for employment growth throughout all regions over the lifetime of this strategy.  </p>  <p>  As part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieve a significant uplift in the amount of FDI projects going into regions, the strategy outlines key actions aimed at achieving that, including a &euro;150m property investment plan, spread out over five years, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals. The funding which includes the &euro;12 million referred to by the Deputy will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  About 30% of the property investment plan will be allocated to the construction of nine advance facilities.</p>  <p>  These sites were decided on by IDA Ireland based on a number of criteria including population density, cluster of activities of other companies in the area and third level educational institutions.  It is important to note that all investment must be targeted to potential investment wins and associated job creation opportunities.   </p>  <p>IDA Ireland has decided to concentrate the investment programme in particular in locations where the private sector has been reluctant to build capacity suitable premises for FDI.  In that context, the Government announced earlier this year that three locations, Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar,   located in Co. Mayo would be the key focus for the 2015 investment programme.  </p>  <p>  In this respect, planning permission was sought and has been obtained for facilities in Sligo and Castlebar.  The procurement process is underway to appoint contractors to construct these facilities and it is anticipated that this process will be complete and contractors will be on-site by year end.   It is planned to submit a planning application during December 2015 to construct a facility in Tralee.  IDA Ireland plans in 2016 to follow a similar process to deliver facilities in Galway, Dundalk and Limerick and in Athlone, Carlow and Waterford in 2017.   </p>  <p>  The Agency has approximately 11 hectares of land on the Sligo Road, Ballina, Co. Mayo, which are zoned and concept master planned with planning permission obtained for core park infrastructure development.  These lands are included in the Agency&rsquo;s database of available lands for marketing to FDI client companies or EI client companies as appropriate.   </p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland has approximately 27 hectares of land on the Navan Business Park available for marketing to FDI client companies or EI clients as appropriate.</p></reply>

So far this year, Advance Technology Buildings have been completed in both Waterford and Athlone and the construction of buildings in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee is at an advanced stage of procurement. Next year, IDA Ireland will continue this programme of advance builds with projects in Galway, Dundalk and Limerick.

This competitive call has closed and applications are currently being assessed. </p>  <p>  -  A &euro;5m fund open to groups of Local Enterprise Offices who come together to bid for funding for projects to support job-creation initiatives in their areas. This competitive call has closed and applications are currently being assessed. </p>  <p>  -  A third, broader, competitive regional call, will support significant projects or initiatives to improve or leverage identified enterprise capability in the regions. An expression of interest phase for this call has concluded and is informing the development of the competitive call, to be launched shortly. </p>  <p>  In the case of all three funding calls, a collaborative approach, tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured. It is not intended to ring-fence funding at county level.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plans will cover the three-year period 2015-2017 to allow for the process to take hold and develop, and to capture a more medium-term ambition for the regions. However, the Regional Action Plans will also be flexible and dynamic to allow additional actions and ideas to be added as they emerge over the period of the Plan. </p>  <p>  The success of the regional Action Plans will lie in the delivery of the actions on schedule. The process will be underpinned by robust reporting arrangements, with twice yearly updates to be published in each region setting out the progress on each of the actions due for delivery. Implementation of each Plan will be overseen by a Regional Implementation Committee, established within each region, which will involve the key stakeholders in the region.  Given that strong business representation is also required to drive the enterprise and jobs focus of the Plan, I am appointing locally-based Enterprise Champions in each region to participate on the Implementation Committee.</p></reply>

I am informed that all companies are advised of their responsibilities under the Companies Acts at the time of incorporation, including their statutory obligations regarding the filing of annual returns and the fact that failure to file annual returns on time results in late penalties, loss of audit exemption and potentially prosecution. </p>  <p>  The Companies Registration Office (CRO) provides information on its website about these requirements and also issues reminder letters to companies in advance of their Annual Return Date to remind them of their obligations to file annual returns.  </p>  <p>  As part of its work programme for 2010/2011 the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) examined the penalties that apply to companies that do not submit their company annual returns by the statutory deadline. These are known as late filing penalties and include monetary fines and loss of audit exemption for two years.  The purpose of the review was to assess the proportionality of those penalties.</p>  <p>  The CLRG concluded that no change should be made to the late filing penalties regime but it did make a recommendation that where a company seeks a waiver from the payment of late filing fees, the grant of that should not be within the powers of the CRO, but rather should be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, preferably the District Court.  The recommendation was given effect in Section 343 (7) of the Companies Act 2014 which was commenced on the 1 June 2015.</p></reply>

The office is manned by two permanent IDA Ireland staff; one dedicated regional official and one official from IDA Ireland's Engineering and Industrial Technology Division.  The office is jointly shared with Enterprise Ireland.  Donegal also has the additional resources of IDA Ireland regional staff in Sligo including a full-time manager focussed on the North-West region.  </p><p>IDA Ireland is satisfied that its foot print in the North-West of the country is sufficient to meet the requirements for Foreign Direct Investment in Donegal.  Marketing of any regional area including Donegal for Foreign Direct Investment occurs through IDA Ireland's network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland.  The agency markets Letterkenny as a gateway location for the region.  The ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the clients and not IDA Ireland.</p><p>There were 6 IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to Donegal in 2014 and in 2015 there were 3 up to the end of September.  It should be noted that 70% of new IDA Ireland jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.  The numbers of IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits for the years 2007 to 2015 inclusive are set out in Table A attached.  </p><p>IDA Ireland markets Donegal as part of its North-West Region, which also comprises Leitrim and Sligo.  The main FDI activity clusters that have emerged in the North-West are in the life sciences and engineering sectors, particularly in the manufacture of medical devices and automotive components.  There are also a small number of large employers in the financial services sector, particularly in Letterkenny and a growing pharma sector in Sligo. </p><p>The number of jobs in IDA Ireland client companies in county Donegal, as per the 2014 Annual Employment Survey, rose from 1,854 in 2010 to 2,612 in 2014.  I attach the breakdown in Table B. The figures for this year will not be available until the 2015 Annual Employment Survey is published early next year.  There are 41 multinational companies in total based in the North-West, employing 5,294 across the Region.  Given the global economic operating environment in recent years, the existing client base has performed well in not only retaining their presence in Donegal, but expanding the number of employees.  The most recent example of this was the announcement in July of this year by Pramerica of the expansion of its facility in Donegal by 330 jobs.</p><p>Achieving a balanced regional dispersal of employment is challenging. IDA Ireland's new five year strategy <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019</i>contains a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations.  To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period.  This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.</p><p>In addition to attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Donegal, I am very committed to encouraging start-ups and nurturing small, high technology companies, with potential for growth.  There are 3,302 people directly employed in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal. Enterprise Ireland has supported, through various programmes, 101 start-up entrepreneurs in Donegal in addition to a further 196 supported by the Local Enterprise Office in Donegal.  A strong indigenous sector is also key to ensuring all the necessary supports are in place for potential FDI investors.</p><p>My Department published its North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan last month as part of the wider Actions Plan for Jobs programme.  This regional plan seeks to maximise the strengths and assets of the region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  </p><p>Table A</p><p>IDA Ireland-sponsored Site Visits to Donegal 2009 to end Q3 2015<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of Site Visits</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>2015 (up to end Q3)</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p>Table B</p><p>IDA Ireland Client Company Jobs in Donegal 2010-2014<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. Companies</th><th>Total Jobs</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>13</td><td>1,854</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>13</td><td>2,106</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>14</td><td>2,228</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>14</td><td>2,387</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>14</td><td>2,612</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The person named was informed in writing of this decision in a letter dated 14 November 2014 and he was also informed that he should contact the Single Farm Payment Section if he believed the parcels were omitted in error from his SPS application.</p>  <p>  My Department then proceeded to recoup the payments already made on these parcels and a further letter issued to the person named on 11 February 2015, informing them that a debt had been raised and advising them that interest would accrue until such time as the debt was paid in full.</p>  <p>  Some recoupment has been made to date and will continue from future Department payments until such time as the debt has been paid in full.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-08a.561.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120800065#WRJ02300"><p>The most recent scientific advice for seabass suggests that the stock is in rapid decline and that fishing mortality levels for this stock are four times higher than the level that would ensure Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  In January 2015, the EU Commission introduced emergency measures to reduce the fishing mortality in commercial fisheries (pelagic trawling) of this stock.  The EU has since adopted a new Regulation that introduces a comprehensive prohibition on commercial fishing for seabass by all EU Member States fishing vessels in the Irish and Celtic Seas.  This underpins the conservation actions already taken by Ireland for over 20 years with regard to this vulnerable stock.  The EU has also increased the minimum landing size for seabass and again Ireland supported this measure. </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes further conservation measures for this stock but we have a concern that the proposal as it stands, while aimed at protecting the stock, may inadvertently harm the highly regulated recreational angling sector in Ireland.  The current proposal would ban all angling activity for seabass for the first six months of the year and a one fish per day rule for the rest of the year.  Currently Ireland operates a 2 fish per day rule and the rest of the EU applies a 3 fish per day rule.  I fully support the one fish per day limit suggested, however as I agree with the Deputy on the potential harm to our tourism sector, I do not support a complete ban on angling for the first six months of the year.  Irish anglers are not the reason that seabass is continuing to decline and Ireland has been at the forefront of conservation measures for this stock for decades.  It would in my view be unfair to take such a severe approach to the recreational sector in Ireland given their ongoing efforts to protect the stock.  Consequently, I will endeavour, at December Council, to persuade the Commission that a catch and release recreational fishery be permitted to continue during the first six months of the year.</p></reply>

The frequency and ferocity of these storm events, compounded by waterlogged soils on many forest sites, led to extensive damage on both private and State owned forest lands. While estimates indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) has been blown down, the damage has been extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down.  Financial support for a replanting grant for privately owned forests affected by the winter storms of 2013/2014 is currently being considered by the Department. A final decision on this matter can be expected shortly.</p></reply>

In addition, there has been no case of Brucellosis on the entire island of Ireland since March 2012 and, as the Deputy might recall, I, along with the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, announced the ending of pre-movement Brucellosis testing on both sides of the Border with effect from 28 September 2015. This means that routine on-farm brucellosis testing is no longer required in the State. <i>This is a major landmark in the history of disease eradication in Ireland and illustrates what can be achieved when all concerned cooperate in delivering an effective eradication programme.  My Department has estimated that, compared to the position prior to the scaling down of testing in 2009, the saving to farmers in terms of testing costs amounts to about &euro;15m per annum. </i></p><p>However, it is vital that we identify and prevent any outbreak of this diseaseand, in this regard, my Department will continue to conduct surveillance testing on cows slaughtered at meat plants. It is also important that, notwithstanding the removal of the legislative requirement to test, farmers should ensure that they have appropriate and proportionate bio-security arrangements in place with regard to animals introduced into their herds in order to protect the health of their own herd and indeed that of their neighbours from infectious and contagious disease.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department worked closely with the EU Commission in March/April of this year with a view to establishing a set of requirements which are clear and workable from the point of view of individual farmers as well as other stakeholders.  I was also mindful of the need to ensure that the implementing provisions were the most appropriate in the context of farming in Ireland and providing as much flexibility as possible to farmers.  In order to benefit from payment under the Direct Aid Schemes, land must be eligible and must also be in a state fit for grazing or cultivation.  </p>  <p>  In the context of compiling a guidance booklet for issue to farmers, officials from my Department sought a meeting and met with officials from the European Commission on 9 April 2015.  The purpose of this meeting was to seek clarification regarding Ireland&rsquo;s interpretation of the EU Regulations governing land eligibility.  In Ireland, it was decided that the most appropriate mechanism to provide for this is to define the characteristics to be met by an agricultural area in order to be deemed maintained in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation.  In the first instance, it should be remembered that it is the responsibility of each Member State to implement EU regulations in respect of the eligibility of land.</p></reply>

Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing.  The attackers are unknown.  Over the years, extensive diplomatic and military efforts to locate Private Joyce have proved fruitless.  To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce&rsquo;s remains.  In late June 2015, Mr. Roderick Murphy presented his report to me.  Following a review of his report a number of clarifications were raised with Mr Murphy which are currently being addressed.  I also sought legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to the publication of the report.

No such interest was expressed at that time.  My officials also met with local representatives and officials from Westmeath County Council to discuss the future of the Barracks.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a number of local organisations are currently using the Barracks.  These include the Westmeath GAA County Board, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Order of Malta and the Midland Youth Services.  The former barracks is also currently used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and it is intended that these arrangements will remain in place.  Leases with these and other local community groups are currently being progressed in my Department. In addition, numerous requests from other community groups wishing to avail of accommodation within the Barracks have also been received.  Regarding accommodation for Westmeath Civil Defence HQ, initial contact was made with my Officials to discuss the possibility of them relocating to Columb Barracks.  The position, however, is that the provision of accommodation for Civil Defence Units is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority.  I would, of course, be happy to consider a proposal from the Council in this regard.  Indeed, given the number of local organisations interested in using the facility, I believe that it may be useful to engage with the Council regarding the long-term development of the Barracks. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality, who is the lead Department for the Refugee Accommodation Programme, is also working with my Officials to establish whether any of the buildings falling within the remit of the Department of Defence, including Columb Barracks, are suitable for the purposes of temporary accommodation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, proposals involving the long-term retention of Mullingar Barracks by my Department, which includes administering multiple leases and fulfilling the many responsibilities of a landlord, will put a significant administrative and financial burden on my Department.  I will be happy to discuss with any interested group, including the Local Authority, any proposals they may have for the possible purchase and future development of the site for the benefit of the local community.</p></reply>

I am also pleased that in the Estimates for 2016 the Courts Service allocation will further increase to &euro;108.672 million which, when non-recurring payroll costs are excluded, is an effective increase of approximately &euro;1.75 million.

Furthermore, capital funding for major developments in the courts was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s Capital Infrastructure and Investment Plan for 2016-2021.  This included a new Public-Private Partnership to deliver a state-of-the art Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Courts building, together with additional Court rooms for the Supreme Court and other Courts offices, on the Hammond Lane site in Dublin.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-08a.714.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120800067#WRL03300"><p>The Legal Services Regulation Bill, which is scheduled to complete its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas this week, gives legislative expression to the commitment in the programme for Government to "establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints".  Having been a sectoral objective under the EU/IMF/ECB 'Troika' Programme, the Bill is now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process as well as an objective of the Action Plan for Jobs, the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020 and the National Reform Plan. </p>  <p>  The Legal Services Regulation Act will constitute a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise - including by reference to the competitiveness indicators raised by the Deputy, which would appear to be those also cited by the National Competitiveness Council in its 2015 Report on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  That Report notes that despite reductions in legal costs during 2013, Ireland remains an expensive location to enforce a business contract (ranked 9th in the OECD, not 8th as the Deputy suggests) and is a place where it takes a significant amount of time to enforce a contract (the 6th longest in the OECD).  The legal services data used for the Report is based on a group of 16 respondents to the relevant CSO survey and 96 separate price observations. </p>  <p>  The more transparent legal costs regime being introduced by the Legal Services Regulation Bill, in tandem with the use of more efficient alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, is intended to bring about significant improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s position in the medium term.  The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice, written in clear language, which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not known, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.</p>  <p>  An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the adjudication of disputed legal costs by the reformed and modernised Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which is currently known as the Taxing-Master's Office.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that shall be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a publicly accessible Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicators. </p>  <p>  The Bill will also introduce a system for processing complaints about excessive costs, which will be the subject of attempts, firstly, by the new Authority at informal resolution, but then escalating to formal resolution where alternative dispute resolution means do not succeed.  This will be the first time that complaints about all legal practitioners will be dealt with by an independent statutory public authority.</p>  <p>  I might add the Bill sets out a clear path to new Legal Partnerships involving barrister/barrister partnerships and barrister/solicitor partnerships, which will allow for such partnerships to open for business, in competition with the more traditional lawyer structures, by late next year.  The new Legal Services Regulatory Authority is also tasked with carrying out public consultations and reporting to me as Minister with further legislative recommendations over its first four years in areas such as removing existing client money and direct access restrictions relating to barristers; examining entry and training requirements for the legal profession; unification of the two legal professions; and the opening of the market to multi-disciplinary practices.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Bill seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners.  These combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers.</p></reply>

The Strategy sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to, work are supported and enabled to do so.  The Strategy is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>-  Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>While I cannot comment on individual circumstances, I can confirm that the Strategy includes a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  For example, an employer help-line is being established by the National Disability Authority, there will be an increase in the pubic sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, and arrangements are being put in place for dedicated recruitment channels for people with disabilities.  The implementation of the Strategy will be subject to regular monitoring, and there will be a review and renewal every three years.</p></reply>

There are currently 16 adapted cells available throughout the prison estate with a further two coming on stream with the opening of the new Cork Prison in early 2016. In addition the original design of the Dochas Centre lends itself to disabled use with minor adjustments if required.  Disabled cells put into new prison accommodation wings are priced as part of an overall refurbishment and as such do not have any unit cost recorded. </p>  <p>  However prison is not a suitable environment for persons with certain medical conditions and/or certain severe disabilities. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service provide a Primary Care Service for all prisoners in their charge, and all efforts are made to meet the needs of all prisoners. When medical requirements or the severity of the disability are such that medical advice is that prison is not a suitable environment, alternatives such as release to an appropriate medical facility, or  to another more suitably environment are considered. The statutory basis for transferring such persons to a non prison environment is the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended. That provision allows conditions to be imposed including conditions on where a person may be. Such persons may be subject to supervision or not, depending on the circumstances. A person who breaches a condition is deemed to be unlawfully at large. I am not in a position at present to give all the detailed information sought by the Deputy but I can say that on 7 December, there were 429 prisoners serving their sentence in the community, the majority of whom will be living at home. The majority of these would not have been released from prison due to a physical disability or medical condition.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continuing review taking into account crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.</p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 October 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 291 members, 12 Reserves, 24 civilians assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division with  245 members, 23 Reserves, 21 civilians allocated to the Westmeath Division.</p><p>I am further informed that there are 47 vehicles allocated to the Roscommon/Longford Division, 11 of which were allocated in 2015 and that there are 51 vehicles assigned to the Westmeath Division, 11 of which were also allocated in 2015.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. A crucial element of this  strategy is to have ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested  5 of which were assigned to the Westmeath Division and are on the ground in the  community. </p><p>The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will, in addition to the recruitment of new trainee Garda&iacute;,  also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.  </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that Fermoy District forms part of the Cork North Garda Division and that as of the 31 October 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were a total of 298 members assigned to the Division. Of these 85 members are attached to Fermoy District supported by 7 Garda Reserves and 7 civilians.

A crucial element of this  strategy is to have ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested  are on the ground in the community nationwide.</p><p>The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will, in addition to the recruitment of new trainee Garda&iacute;, also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. </p><p>The recently announced Operation Thor builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.

A very welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants. In this regard the Government is providing a very important investment in new Garda technology, information systems and vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021, amounting to &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the overall strategic transformation programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants taking on board the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis. A number of improvements have been put in place, including greater use of clerical support staff which helps to free up Garda&iacute; to concentrate on the execution as opposed to the administration of warrants. I am  advised that the warrants issue is a recurring agenda item at Garda Senior Management Meetings, as well as regional performance and accountability meetings, to ensure that the situation is continually monitored.</p></reply>

It is the Government's intention that the Bill be completed for enactment before the end of this year. The Scheme of the Bill, which was published by the Government last March, has also been considered for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee of Justice, Defence and Equality, which issued an interim report in July. </p>  <p>  The progress of the Bill before the Houses coincides in a very practical way with the progress being made in advancing the recommendations and findings of the Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process.  The fundamental premise of the Working Group's deliberations was that the length of stay applicants have in Direct Provision is unacceptable. The Government, in addressing this matter, has introduced the International Protection Bill, called for by the Working Group, to have a new single application procedure which should ensure that delays are radically reduced, bringing certainty and timely decisions to those who qualify for international protection. In drafting the Bill, the Government was mindful of the specific recommendations of the Working Group which dealt with improvements in the protection process. This Bill properly reflects the intent of 26 of the Working Group recommendations and as such is the single biggest response by Government to date. The introduction of this Bill to bring Irish asylum application procedures in line with other European States as called for in the Report, is the single most important reform in this area.</p></reply>

Under the relevant EU measures Ireland has agreed to relocate approximately 2,600 persons to Ireland over a two year period. The IRPP are cognisant of the fact that this particular cohort of persons are considered highly likely to obtain refugee status in a short period of time and will not be residing in EROCs for a lengthy period of time. Accordingly, some of the factors identified by the Deputy are not as relevant for this group of persons. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, together with colleagues in the City and County Managers Association, are considering how best to address the accommodation needs of this cohort once they obtain refugee status and are dispersed across the community, again taking account of a range of relevant factors. Their report is not yet finalised but they are expected to make a report in due course to the Taskforce established by the Government to oversee the IRPP.</p></reply>

I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that under the Policing Plan 2015, one station in Co. Clare was closed earlier this year, however, another local station was reopened.  The Garda Station at Lisseycasey was closed due to the expiry of its lease and its policing functions were transferred to the reopened Garda Station at Kilmihil, approximately 12km away.   I am advised that Kilmihil Station was a new build and originally constructed as a purpose built Garda Station.  Its reopening and use facilitated the Office of Public Works in not having to enter into another lease with the associated financial implications.  </p>  <p>  The Rationalisation Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.   In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefitted from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. </p>  <p>  The Garda Stations which have been closed were returned to, and are now under the control of, the Office of Public Works (OPW).  The future use of such properties is a matter for the OPW as the owners of the properties.</p></reply>

Figures are taken from the Annual Reports for the Irish Prison Service. <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Daily average number of persons in custody</th></tr><tr><td>2015 (Up to and including 30th November 2015)</td><td>3,726</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3,916</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>4,158</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>4,318</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>4,390</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>4,290</td></tr></table>As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015, it is intended to align the bed capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. This has been completed for 9 out of the 14 prisons in the State.  The number in custody on 7 December (3,777) represented 93% of the Inspector of Prisons recommended total of 3,977. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland rose from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,318 during 2012, an increase of over 30%.  Likewise the total number of committals to prison also rose sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.</p><p>2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007.  There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure.  The overall daily average number of prisoners in custody has also dropped in recent years.  The average number in custody for 2014 was 3,916 a reduction of 10.8% on the 2011 average of 4,390.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011.  On 7 December 2015 there are 904 less prisoners in custody which represents a decrease of 19%.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Irish Prison Service employs a wide range of approaches in addressing prisoners offending behaviours.  While it is important to note that the best indication of future offending are the age, gender, offence type and the criminal history of the individual, there are also dynamic factors that the prisons and other agencies can address.  These include employment status, education level, family situation and drug and addiction issues. In addition there are more complex psychological factors that are associated with offending that can also be addressed by the prison system.</p><p>To address these issues the Irish Prison Service has rolled out Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) across all Prisons.  This is a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. </p><p>Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reaching statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</p><p>Since 2011, the Irish Prison Service has introduced a number of new schemes to specifically aid prisoner reintegration and reduce re-offending.  The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups. </p><p>A recent report on the Community Return Scheme has showed that there were 232 persons released in the first year of the Scheme, from October 2011 to end September 2012. Of this group the report highlighted that as at the end of year 2013, 91% of those involved in the Scheme had not returned to custody.</p><p>In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office has published two recidivism studies, for 2007 and 2008, the latter of which shows an overall reduction in recidivism of 4.3% from the previous year.  The latest recidivism study, for 2009, will be published on 14 December 2015.  The publication of these recidivism studies and of future studies allows the Irish Prison Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners.  This will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of new strategies aimed at reducing recidivism</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have recently launched the Joint Agency Response to Crime initiative (JARC), which aims to implement a multi-agency approach to the management of crime, to prioritise certain prolific offenders and to develop specific initiatives which will address their behaviour and reduce crime thereby increasing community safety.</p></reply>

The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups. </p><p>A recent report on the Community Return Scheme has showed that there were 232 persons released in the first year of the Scheme, from October 2011 to end September 2012.  Of this group the report highlighted that as at the end of year 2013, 91% of those involved in the Scheme had not returned to custody.</p><p>In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office has published two recidivism studies, for 2007 and 2008, the latter of which shows an overall reduction in recidivism of 4.3% from the previous year.  The latest recidivism study, for 2009, will be published on 14 December 2015.  The publication of these recidivism studies and of future studies allows the Irish Prison Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners.  This will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of new strategies aimed at reducing recidivism</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that I have recently launched the Joint Agency Response to Crime initiative (JARC), which aims to implement a multi-agency approach to the management of crime, to prioritise certain prolific offenders and to develop specific initiatives which will address their behaviour and reduce crime thereby increasing community safety.</p></reply>

This includes the procurement and maintenance of various technologies utilised to manage the Service, and support front-line Garda&iacute; and intelligence-led operations against organised crime.</p>  <p>  In that context, the total amount allocated to ICT Subheads in the 2015 Garda Vote was &euro;65.7m.  A further &euro;7m was allocated recently to allow work to commence on 3 new phases of the Major Investigations System this year and to meet other additional hardware requirements. Under the Government Capital Plan 2016-2021, an additional &euro;205m has been provided towards a major investment programme in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, I secured additional capital funding of &euro;4m for 2016 to allow Ireland to participate in the Schengen Information System (SIS II), a centralised secure database used by European countries for maintaining information (alerts) related to border security and law enforcement.  In light of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, I am determined to press ahead with the necessary steps to allow Ireland to participate fully in the Schengen Information System (SIS II) as quickly as possible.  This will bring the total capital expenditure on the Garda ICT over the lifetime of the Plan to in excess of &euro;330m which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.</p></reply>

In 2013 a capital allocation of &euro;1.5m was made available by my Department for the provision of new youth cafes.  Pobal assisted my Department with the administration of the scheme.  Some 95 applications were received and 30 proposals for new youth cafes around the country were approved for funding.</p>  <p>  I am advised that an application was received in respect of a youth caf&eacute; in Monasterevin from Kildare Youth Services.  However, the application was unsuccessful on this occasion as it did not achieve a sufficiently high score for inclusion in the final list of projects approved for funding.  An application from County Kildare Youth Hub in Kildare Town was successful and has received a capital grant of &euro;50,000 towards the cost of developing a new youth caf&eacute; facility.  The group is working with Pobal to complete the youth caf&eacute; project. </p>  <p>  Youth Caf&eacute;s offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space, for recreation, non-formal learning and youth activities and they make an important contribution to facilities for young people at local level.  Recent research undertaken by my Department indicates that there are now more than 150 youth caf&eacute;s throughout the country.  In the main, these have been developed, over the years, by local communities with the support of different funding sources.</p>  <p>  While additional capital funding of &euro;2.25m has been provided to my Department in Budget 2016, this funding is allocated, in the main, for small scale capital works, such as re-fits and accessibility improvements in the voluntary youth services funded under schemes administered by my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department does not have available to it in 2016 a capital fund for the development of new youth caf&eacute;s.  The development of youth caf&eacute; facilities is a priority for my Department should further capital funding become available for these purposes in future years.</p></reply>

To all those affected, I wish to express my sincere sympathies. In order to identify learning about how to better address the needs of vulnerable children and families, the National Review Panel (NRP) was established in 2010 to review serious incidences and deaths of children in care.  It is an independent body chaired by Dr Helen Buckley of Trinity College and its reports are published on the Tusla website. </p><p>The National Review Panel recently published its 2014 Annual Report of reviews of the cases of 29 children and young people, 26 of these children died, and a further 3 were involved in serious incidents:</p><p>-Nearly one third of these deaths were a result of natural causes, including congenital conditions;</p><p>-Very sadly, a further 8 children and young people died by suicide, 3 of whom were in care;</p><p>-Five children died in road traffic accidents and 2 died by homicide.</p><p>The Review Panel found that there was no case where either action or inaction on the part of the HSE or Tusla was a direct contributory factor in the deaths.  However, as is the explicit purpose of this work, the Review Panel also found areas of historical deficits in practice and inconsistencies in service provision.  These include providing timely access to a social worker; more clear evidence of parental capacity to change in social work assessments and earlier decisions to take a child into care.  This Government&rsquo;s establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has already addressed some of these historical deficits.  Government has provided additional funding to Tusla this year to significantly increase the number of social workers dedicated to working with these vulnerable children and families.</p><p>As a learning organisation, Tusla is committed to embedding the lessons of such reviews, and a number of relevant actions are currently underway to further enhance the response to vulnerable children and families such as:</p><p><i>-Meitheal</i>is an initiative to make best use of all early interventions to support families in a coordinated way and to best address childrens' needs;</p><p>-Tusla is developing an assessment model for social workers, to support evidence- informed assessment, greater consistency and enhanced practice in engaging families;</p><p>-New <i>Threshold Guidance</i>has been introduced to ensure social work interventions are made in a proportionate and timely manner.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is represented in the following tables.  All information included can be found in the National Review Panel Annual reports, published on the Tusla website.</p><p>Table 1: Care Status at Time of Death<table><tr><th>Care Status</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>In care</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Known to services</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>In aftercare at the time of death/in care immediately prior to their 18th birthday or in aftercare and under 21</td><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>13</td><td>19</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15</td><td>23</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>81</td></tr></table>Table 2: Age at Time of Death<table><tr><th>Age Band</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Infant &amp;lt; 12 months</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>1 -5 years old</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>6  - 10 years old</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>11 -16 years old</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>17 - 20 years old</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; 20 years old</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15</td><td>23</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>81</td></tr></table>Table 3: Cause of Death<table><tr><th>Cause of Death</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Natural Causes</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Suicide</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Road traffic accident</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Other - Accidental</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Drug Overdose</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Homicide</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cause of death to be verified</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15</td><td>23</td><td>17</td><td>26</td><td>81</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Following the development of the report, the Health Service Executive (HSE) established the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme.  The scope of the Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through to primary, secondary and tertiary care.  This provides a national strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  The Programme includes the standardisation of access to and delivery of, high quality, safe and efficient hospital services nationally, as well as improved linkages with primary care services.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme is nearing completion of a Model of Care for the provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland, which will be the basis for the delivery of services.</p>  <p>  The HSE Disability Services Division has a role in certain key aspects of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services, primarily the provision of community-based therapy services and personal social services.  The Disability Services Division will use the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to focus on Disability funded rehabilitation services and enable reconfiguration of existing provision through establishment of demonstration sites.  Close links will be maintained with the Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that all initiatives receive optimal support.  Demonstration sites have been identified by Disability Services and mapping has commenced.</p>  <p>  A National Steering Group, chaired by the Health Service Executive Social Care Division, has been assigned the task of developing an implementation framework for the National Policy and Strategy for Neuro-Rehabilitation Services.  The Steering Group includes representation from the National Clinical Programmes for Rehabilitation Medicine and Neurology, the Department of Health, Primary Care, Therapy Professions and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland.  Once the implementation framework has been agreed by the Steering Group, it will then go for consultation to the wider stakeholder interest groups.  Following consultation, the framework will be revised and it will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.</p>  <p>  The HSE is very aware of the needs of people with neurological conditions and will continue to work towards improved services, making best use of available resources in the interests of all those who require supports.</p>  <p>  I have referred the element of the Deputies' questions regarding community teams to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputies.

While certain flexibilities had been built in to the Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework contained a commitment to develop a plan to facilitate the full participation of such children in the ECCE Programme.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of ECCE supports for children with a disability.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model. </p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The title of physiotherapist will, as a consequence, be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p>  <p>  I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of physical therapist under the Act.  In the rest of the English speaking world the titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist are interchangeable and their users are qualified physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.   </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations, including the Irish Association of Physical Therapists, regarding my proposal to protect the title of physical therapist as a variant of the title of physiotherapist and invited them to submit their views.  The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year that ensures public protection and appropriately addresses the legitimate concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive (CBD) on its website -  - and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified for the dissemination of information on the CBD by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements.  The NCP also has a responsibility to ensure that all enquirers are informed of the right to healthcare, if any, that they may have through the European legislation on the coordination of social security schemes (EU Regulation 883/04) and which may be more beneficial to them.  The NCP is able to inform patients what the cost of their treatments would be in Ireland to allow them make a comparison with the costs they are being quoted for comparable treatment in another Member State. </p><p>The healthcare being sought under the CBD can only be healthcare that a person would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.  It will be a matter for the patient and his/her referring doctor to identify the clinician abroad and satisfy him/herself in relation to the qualifications, quality and safety of the services being availed of in the other jurisdiction.  In general, healthcare is not routinely advertised and the best options for treatment are most appropriately discussed within the professional setting and advice received as to where services might be sought, including availing of the provisions of the CBD for treatment. </p><p>It is also noteworthy that access to healthcare abroad under the Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways; that is, a referral is required in order to be eligible for reimbursement. Referral for care under the CBD can be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other HSE clinicians.  This referral is not limited to Irish health professionals but nevertheless the great majority of patients are likely to have consulted an Irish health professional who then referred them for treatment here or, if they wished, within the EU\EEA.  As a consequence, a general information campaign regarding the CBD has not been undertaken.  It is also noteworthy that Recital 4 of the Directive states &ldquo;the transposition of this Directive into national legislation and its application should not result in patients being encouraged to receive treatment outside their Member State of affiliation&rdquo;.  The HSE has tried to balance its dissemination of information regarding the CBD with this Recital in mind and has concentrated on informing the clinicians who make the referrals about the Directive.  To this end it has met with the ICGP and various consultants at hospital level to inform them of the provisions of the Directive.</p><p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the matter of the data requested and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

It is part of a legal obligation on health insurers to provide a specific minimum level of benefit in all health insurance products sold. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p>  <p>  This approach is designed to be equitable and fair, by ensuring that all consumers obtain an appropriate minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase.  Every plan available is inclusive of the minimum suite of benefits/procedures, some of which are applicable to the whole market and some of which will be applicable specifically to either men or women.  For example, the Regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women). </p>  <p>  The health services and procedures provided by minimum benefit should be viewed as a cohort of procedures that are important and of benefit to the community of the insured population, and thus should be protected and provided as a minimum base to all.</p></reply>

Risk equalisation is the standard transfer mechanism used to equalise risk and underpin community rating internationally. The Risk Equalisation Scheme in Ireland  involves  the collection of a community rating levy from insurers  by the Revenue Commissioners. These levies are paid into a Risk Equalisation Fund operated by the Health Insurance Authority who redistributes the Fund back to the market through credits payable to insurers in respect of insured older lives (aged 60 and over) and utilisation of in-patient hospital services. This system ensures that all insured persons continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product and helps to support affordable premiums for all. </p>  <p>  The Risk Equalisation Scheme is self-funding, ie the cost of credits is met by the stamp duties raised. The total stamp duty levies raised under the Risk Equalisation Scheme on health insurance products written in 2013 was &euro;413m, while an additional &euro;173m was taken in under the ARTC Scheme in respect of policies taken out or renewed from 1 August to 31 December 2012 and paid to the Exchequer in February 2013.   The total amount raised in 2014 was &euro;582m.</p></reply>

The legislation obliges the HSE, when making a decision on a person&rsquo;s eligibility, to take account of a person&rsquo;s financial situation. This requires the provision of information by the applicant. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of difficult circumstances, whether medical or social which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services. In doing so, the HSE may seek additional supporting information which can be, at  times,  intensive but necessary to ensure a fair discretionary review for applicants whose income has exceeded the income limits. </p>  <p>  I recognise that the existing assessment system is complex because it tries to ensure that a wide range of personal circumstances can be taken into account. We are still committed to further improving the existing system and the work of the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility will be central to this in the immediate future. The Group was established by the Director General of the HSE and is continuing its work on  developing a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. </p>  <p>  As evidenced by the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year, the HSE is exercising greater discretion in its medical cards assessments than ever before.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-12-08a.1141.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015120800074#WRS00400"><p>Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.</p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. </p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs. As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy. Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.</p></reply>

This process has commenced.</p>  <p>  Student nurses participate in the 4th year rostered clinical placement as part of their degree programme and are paid in accordance with the trainee rates specified in the National Minimum Wage Acts for the duration of the placement. At present they are paid &euro;6.49 per hour for the first 12 weeks of the placement, &euro;6.92 for the second 12 weeks and &euro;7.79 for the third 12 weeks, excluding premium payments. This equates to approximately 53% of the 1st point of the staff nurse scale. Mental health student nurses are paid 2.3% more, reflecting existing relativities between general and psychiatric staff nurse pay scales.  When undertaking the placement, the students are not qualified nurses and require supervision. This is reflected in the 2:1 replacement ratio for student nurses replacing staff nurses. </p>  <p>  The current rates of pay will be increased from the 1st January 2016, in line with the increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.15 per hour announced in Budget 2016 and provided for in the National Minimum Wage Order 2015 (S.I.

We know how important it is not just for our economy but also for the continuing strength of British-Irish relations and for peace and stability in Northern Ireland. It&rsquo;s also our firm view that the EU is better and stronger as a whole on account of UK membership. That is why our main focus remains on doing all we can to ensure that the UK remains part of the Union, rather than planning for their departure.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government fully recognises that it must be prepared for all scenarios and we are already in regular contact with a wide range of stakeholders, both North and South of the border and across the UK. This should help identify the many different issues that could arise, including with regard to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Further work is also being undertaken across other Government Departments in this regard. The Department of the Taoiseach continues to coordinate cross-Governmental efforts in this area as we move forward with this work. This includes research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of EU membership.</p>  <p>  My own Department, given its responsibility for both Foreign Affairs and Trade, is naturally heavily involved. My officials are engaging actively with counterparts across our own system, as well as within the Northern Irish and British administrations and further afield in other EU capitals.</p>  <p>  A key aim for us is to ensure that stakeholders in Northern Ireland and across the UK understand why their EU membership matters as much as it does for Ireland. Most recently, on 26 November I joined the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Ms. Arlene Foster MLA, in addressing a seminar in Belfast which was jointly organised by Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast (QUB), the Institute for International and European Affairs (IIEA) and the Irish Association for Cultural, Economic and Social Relations. This provided a valuable opportunity to stimulate debate on this issue, raising awareness of the potential impacts for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have also addressed influential audiences on this topic in Chatham House, London and most recently in Dublin at a Breakfast Seminar organised by the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce (BICC) and hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at Iveagh House.</p>  <p>  At a political level, my recent meeting with Foreign Secretary Hammond in London on 23 November provided an opportunity to re-emphasise the importance of the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of the EU. The Taoiseach has had similar exchanges with Prime Minister Cameron, most recently on 9 November. We have underlined our commitment to supporting the UK&rsquo;s efforts to reach agreement at EU level on reforms that address the broad issues raised by Prime Minister Cameron in his letter of 10 November to European Council President Donald Tusk, while ensuring an outcome that is not only good for the UK, but good for Ireland and good for the EU as a whole.</p></reply>

This is a service which my Department provides so that media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated. Examples of such events this year included the visit in May of HRH The Prince of Wales and HRH The Duchess of Cornwall, the hosting of the first Global Irish Civic Forum in June and the official launch in October of the Passport Card. In addition, the use of photography services by overseas missions for significant promotional events resulted in positive global coverage of Ireland.In September 2011, my Department led a collaborative advertised tender process for the procurement of a multi-supplier competitive framework of photographic service providers. This is now available for use by all Government Departments. Details of the framework arrangements and the photographers used are posted on the National Procurement Service website: . The purpose of this framework is to ensure Departments' compliance with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money by having a competitive process for photographic assignments.  </p><p>In addition, my Department now makes greater use of in-house resources for photography, including, for example, at last month's launch in Iveagh House of the National Report on Global Education in Ireland.</p><p>Total expenditure from my entry into office in July 2014 to date is &euro;50,054.65, as detailed in the following table form:<table><tr><th><b>July-Dec 2014 events  </b></th><th><b>Expenditure from July &ndash;

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since my entry into office in July 2014. The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.  DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year and managing the SCMF student competition. This typically involves the following activities: </p><p>Convening national and regional information workshops;</p><p>Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>Organising the judging process</p><p>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;</p><p>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  </p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund. This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  DHR was awarded a new two-year contract in April 2015 following a competitive tendering process.</p><p>Following a further competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day 2015 flagship event in Dublin. Like annual Africa Day events held over successive years, this incorporated musical entertainment and cultural activities aimed principally at family audiences. DHR&rsquo;s role involved the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which they managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website. This work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below. This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>The table below sets out the payments to DHR since July 2014.</p><p><b>Expenditure July 2014 - Date</b><table><tr><th>Receipt and Project/Event</th><th><div>2014</div></th><th><div>2015</div></th></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Simon Cumbers Media Fund</td><td><div>&euro;32,220</div></td><td><div>&euro;84,565.48</div></td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications &ndash; Africa Day</td><td><div>&euro;39,587</div></td><td><div>&euro;173,345.1</div></td></tr></table>It is important to note that the variance in Africa Day amounts for 2014 and 2015 is accounted for by the fact that a majority of 2014-related expenditure was incurred prior to my entry into office in July of last year.</p></reply>

On 19 November the French Parliament, definitively adopted the three-month extension and expansion of the State of emergency. The French Government decided that in order to avert possible further terrorist attacks, and to protect public safety, some restrictions on demonstrations and public gatherings were necessary. While such restrictions are a serious matter in any society, the terrible circumstances which gave rise to them has to be taken into consideration.    Every government has a responsibility to balance the duty to protect its citizens with their entitlement to freedom of assembly. I have no doubt that the French Government is fully sensitised to the need for such balance.</p></reply>

That strategy is based on two key objectives: Firstly, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, secondly, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.    In furtherance of these objectives, I have intensively engaged with the Egyptian authorities, including the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Egypt&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland, and with EU and international partners, including High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Federica Mogherini. The Taoiseach also raised the case in person on two occasions with Egyptian President al-Sisi. The information we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in reviewing our approach to this case on a constant basis.</p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to both the citizen and their family. I would also note that Embassy officials visited this citizen in detention for the forty-eight time on 23 November.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to accord a high priority to this case and our approach is guided at all times by the two key objectives set out above.</p></reply>

Since then over 12,000 applications have been received and over 11,200 cards produced. The card is accepted for travel in all EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries and Switzerland (31 countries in total) and gives exactly the same entitlements and protections as a passport book. There has been a positive public reaction to this Irish-led innovative project including from those Irish citizens who travel frequently within Europe. It is also appears to be in demand by young adults for age-identification purposes.We have been informed by a small number of citizens that they have encountered difficulties with the card being accepted. This appears to have happened at regional airports in the main. To avoid this in the future I have asked our Embassies in each EU and EEA country and Switzerland to make contact with Ministries of Justice/Home Affairs as relevant and request them to ensure that all border guards are fully appraised of the validity of the Irish Passport Card for travel.    Additionally the details of the Passport Card have been uploaded to Keesing&rsquo;s document checker database. This is a comprehensive database for identity documents and bank notes and is widely used by government agencies including military and police, immigration offices, customs, embassies and tax authorities. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have arranged for that document to be uploaded to the Edison Database (Electronic Documentation and Information System on Investigation Networks).   This database can be accessed by all 190 Interpol member countries through a secure internet system known as I-24/7.</p>  <p>  The process of uploading the document onto the European Union &ldquo;False and Authentic Documents Online&rdquo; (FADO) database is underway by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. FADO is available to document experts in partner states including in all member states of the EU. When this process is complete the document will be uploaded to the European Council&rsquo;s Public Register of Authentic Travel and Identity Documents Online website. I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this final stage could take up to four months. </p></reply>

This includes the investigation of any criminal activity that may have been carried out by Security Service Personnel and the murder of the person in question. Given the broad scope and range of possible offences, relating to up to fifty murders, this investigation will require considerable PSNI resources if it is to be concluded effectively.  I understand that the PSNI is currently engaged in a scoping exercise to determine the potential scale of the investigation necessary, with a view to potentially seeking additional resources from the Northern Department of Justice or from the Northern Ireland Office.    The issues raised in this case are serious and complex, and are a reminder of the importance of dealing with the legacy of the violence perpetrated by all parties to the Troubles.  I remain convinced that the institutional framework as agreed in the Stormont House Agreement offers the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the loss of loved ones and those who continue to suffer trauma. The Government remains committed to achieving the establishment of these institutions so that we can, in a fundamental way, deal with the past and foster reconciliation.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention to meet with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, and with the Northern Minister for Justice, David Ford, later this month.  Among the issues which we would discuss would be how to make progress on legacy matters.  This would include how the PSNI&rsquo;s legacy investigations would be resourced pending implementation of a new institutional framework for dealing with the past.</p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for SNA support enrol or leave a school. New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time.</p><p>  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised that the school in question had an allocation of 12 whole time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts for the 2015/16, to support a current enrolment of 26 pupils. In addition the school has 5 teaching staff, which provides 17 whole time staff supporting 26 pupils in the school.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that these pupils have a range of complex needs, this represents a very significant level of staffing for this school.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised that the school concerned has recently lodged an appeal of its staffing allocation under the NCSE appeal process, details of which are provided at www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE has advised that this appeal will be processed shortly by a Senior SENO and that the school will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Otherwise he/she would continue to be assessed on the basis of his/her parents' income. The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof has been submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the scheme including independent residency.</p><p>The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the relevant grant awarding authority. As such, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of all documents that would be acceptable to an awarding authority, as each individual's particular set of circumstances varies. However, the type of documentary evidence that might be required would include:</p><p>-  a letter confirming that the applicant's address is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board; or</p><p>-  a Local Authority lease agreement or a letter confirming the applicant's rental under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS); or</p><p>-  a letter confirming the receipt and period of rent or mortgage supplement; or</p><p>-  a utility bill in the applicant's name, for example; landline telephone, fixed broadband, gas, electricity or cable/satellite television bill.

Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

The demographic projections for the Wexford Town area does not indicate that a new post primary school is required.</p><p>  As part of my Department's School Capital Investment Programme, a number of building projects in Wexford schools are being progressed, including Loreto Secondary School and Wexford C.B.S., that will provide for increased capacity in the area. In addition, an application for additional accommodation was received last week from Selskar College which is being considered. </p><p>My Department is also monitoring the position in the area taking into account the latest pupil enrolment data and the impact of planned expansion of school capacity.

In 2009, 41 Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST) posts were in place with 21 of these posts in the primary education system.  From 1st September 2009, responsibility for the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers moved to the National Educational Welfare Board as did other support services including the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) service.  The HSCL service works with Traveller parents but it has the broader remit of working with other families whose children are at risk of educational disadvantage.These services are now part of Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  484 Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts were in place during 2008/2009 at primary level.  Following the withdrawal of the RTT posts from 31st August 2011, a limited number of alleviation posts to assist schools that had high concentrations of traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTTs were created.  120 alleviation posts at primary level were in place in 2014/2015.  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and resource teaching allocations for primary schools is designed to include traveller pupils who had previously been supported by RTT posts.</p><p>  The current policy in relation to Traveller Education is informed by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006, following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups and other relevant stakeholders.</p><p>  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy.  The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need.  This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers.</p></reply>

At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.</p>  <p>  Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Where at least 20% of the total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support, the school may lodge an appeal with the Appeals Board. Having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support, additional post(s) may be approved by the Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  I will arrange for the information sought by the Deputy to be forwarded directly to him.</p></reply>

From 1 September 2012, the Teaching Council is the decision-making body with statutory authority to determine criteria and procedures for probation for registration of newly qualified teachers. The Council has outlined a service requirement and a professional competence requirement for the probation process.  Currently, the Inspectorate supports the process of probation for registration purposes at the request of the Teaching Council in some primary schools. Inspectors conduct inspection visits to inform the Council about the professional competence requirement of conditionally registered teachers in these schools. These inspection visits are part of the Inspectorate's annual programme of work. Generally, the time allocated to these inspection visits ranges from one half day to one day per teacher in a year.</p>  <p>  The numbers of primary teachers who satisfied the professional competence requirement of the probation process by means of inspection visits for each academic year from 2010/11 to 2014/15 and whose details were provided to the Teaching Council are as follows: 1924 teachers in 2010/11; 1961 teachers in 2011/12; 1918 teachers in 2012/13; 1715 teachers in 2013/14 and 1778 teachers in 2014/15.</p>  <p>  These teachers will also have had to satisfy the Council regarding service requirements and the Inspectorate is not involved in that process. In addition, since 2013/14, a number of teachers have satisfied the professional competence and service requirements for full registration through the Council's Droichead process. Consequently, the Inspectorate is not aware of the total number of teachers who have satisfactorily completed the probation process for registration with the Teaching Council within the years 2010-2014.</p>  <p>  The numbers of primary teachers who were inspected but who did not satisfy the professional competence requirement of the probation process by means of inspection visits for each academic year from 2010/11 to 2014/15 are as follows: 70 teachers in 2010/11; 48 teachers in 2011/12; 62 teachers in 2012/13; 51 teachers in 2013/14; and 54 teachers in 2014/15.</p>  <p>  These teachers may have satisfied the professional competence requirement in subsequent years. </p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that one member of staff in the NEPS Castlebar Office has been lost due to long-term career break and that my Department is actively pursuing a replacement. In the interim, however, I would advise that any parent who has concerns in relation to their child's educational development should raise these concerns, in the first instance with the Principal of the school with a view to discussing the situation with the local NEPS service. If an assessment is deemed appropriate, it will be provided.</p></reply>

It recommended that a school's Special Needs Teaching allocation should be determined by a baseline component according to pupil numbers and a school's educational profile.  This profile is to take account of the number of pupils with complex needs, the percentage of pupils performing below average in standardised tests and the social context and gender breakdown of the school.</p><p>The NCSE Working Group report recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented.  A pilot of the new allocation model is therefore taking place over the course of the current school year.</p><p>47 schools (28 primary schools and 19 posts primary schools) have agreed to participate in the pilot project, which will run for the duration of the current school year.  An initial list of schools was selected by the Educational Research Centre, using sampling techniques designed to ensure that as full a range of schools as possible is represented.  For primary schools the sample included appropriate representation by disadvantaged classification, gender mix and size.  For post-primary schools the sample included appropriate representation by sector, disadvantage classification, gender mix and size.  A list of schools was generated within each of these categories, along with replacements for first-selected schools.</p><p>The pilot will test the practical impacts of the new model prior to full implementation.  Significant guidance has been prepared and provided to the schools involved.  During the Pilot all participating schools will complete an assessment questionnaire to gather information on their experiences.  All participating schools attended a pilot information day on 15th September and a further information day took place on Friday last.</p><p>A list of the schools participating in the pilot project and details of the support teaching allocation which has been made for each school is attached. Please note, the allocations noted for each school represent the total allocations made to the school under the pilot project. These allocations therefore replace the allocations usually made to schools through learning support general allocations and the NCSE allocation process, but are not allocations made additionally to these allocations.</p><p><b>Appendix 1: Schools Participating in Pilot Project 2015/16</b></p><p><b>Primary Schools</b><table><tr><th>Roll_<br /><br />Number</th><th>Name of School </th><th>County</th><th>DEIS</th><th>School Gender </th><th>Allocation<br /><br />(Hours)</th></tr><tr><td>20231H</td><td>St. Benedict's National School</td><td>Dublin</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>237.5</td></tr><tr><td>19583I</td><td>St. Josephs Senior NS, Ballymun</td><td>Dublin</td><td>DEIS 1</td><td>Mixed</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>15046I</td><td>St. Stephen's National School</td><td>Waterford </td><td>DEIS 2</td><td>Boys</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td>18057F</td><td>Scoil Mhuire</td><td>Offaly</td><td></td><td>Senior Girls</td><td>157.5</td></tr><tr><td>20292E</td><td>Maynooth Educate Together </td><td>Kildare</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>87.5</td></tr><tr><td>16928B</td><td>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Naomh Philom</td><td>Offaly</td><td>DEIS 2</td><td>Girls</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>198460</td><td>Reath na Maidine</td><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td>Boys</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>15948C</td><td>Clologue National School</td><td>Wexford</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>20309S</td><td>Mary Mother of Hope</td><td>Dublin</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>03936C</td><td>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta (Scoil Mhuire)</td><td>Westmeath</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>17493U</td><td>Rosenallis National School</td><td>Laois</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>27.5</td></tr><tr><td>19490B</td><td>Scoil Mhuire</td><td>Dublin</td><td>DEIS 1</td><td>Mixed</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>17840P</td><td>SN Bheinin Naofa</td><td>Meath</td><td></td><td>Girls</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>19837N</td><td>Drimnagh Castle CBS NS</td><td>Dublin </td><td></td><td>Boys</td><td>305</td></tr><tr><td>17903N</td><td>Cornamaddy NS</td><td>Westmeath</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>13632L</td><td>Annalitten National School</td><td>Monaghan</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>13.4</td></tr><tr><td>18246I</td><td>SN Baile Mhuine</td><td>Cork</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>13.4</td></tr><tr><td>17920N</td><td>Donard National School</td><td>Wicklow</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>40.3</td></tr><tr><td>16829W</td><td>Scoil Eoin P&oacute;l (Lough an Iubhair)</td><td>Donegal</td><td>DEIS R</td><td>Mixed</td><td>14.250</td></tr><tr><td>18350D</td><td>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Na Hinse</td><td>Tipperary</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>29.875</td></tr><tr><td>18598Q</td><td>Earnain Mxd NS</td><td>Westmeath</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>33.50</td></tr><tr><td>15257V</td><td>Quignamanger National School/St Oliver Plunket</td><td>Mayo</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>103.07</td></tr><tr><td>19418Q</td><td>Castlerahan Central National S</td><td>Cavan</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>56.775</td></tr><tr><td>19817H</td><td>St.<br /><br />Marys NS Lucan</td><td>Dublin</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>128.075</td></tr><tr><td>02413L</td><td>Scoil Naomh Eoin, Birr</td><td>Offaly</td><td></td><td>Mixed</td><td>40.4</td></tr><tr><td>16289Q </td><td>St..

These include assessment reports not only from staff from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) but also from a range of professional staff within the HSE (Clinical Psychologists, Occupational / Speech Therapists, Psychiatrists, etc) and their private sector counterparts. Application for resources in support of individual pupils are submitted by school authorities to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) using the assessment reports furnished by the forgoing agencies as support the application.</p><p>My Department's NEPS service provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and/or intervention. When a NEPS psychologist becomes involved with an individual pupil it is for the purposes of identifying that pupil's special educational needs and the appropriate interventions to be put in place to meet those needs. These interventions commonly have relevance to the work of the existing class teacher, learning support staff, the provision of advice on alternative placement, as well as the provision of additional Resource Teaching or SNA support.While NEPS maintains a client database of its involvement with individual students this structure was developed to track the history of NEPS involvement with the student during the course of their school careers, it was not designed to record their eligibility for additional resources. Individual school authorities are responsible for and retain records of the range of applications to NCSE for such additional resources.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating Resource Teaching Support and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.</p><p>The NCSE has published details of all of the allocations which have been made to primary and post primary schools for the 2015/16 school year, including schools in Dublin North East Inner City and Dublin North West Inner City, on its website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The policy informing QQI's application of fees was subject to extensive consultation and provides that fees will be comprehensive, coherent and reflect the amount and complexity of the work undertaken by QQI.  Fees had always been applied to providers in the higher education and training sector and QQI introduced fees for providers in the further education and training sector, thereby applying its policies equitably.  </p><p>In 2013 QQI published its policy for re-engagement with all education and training providers that had a quality assurance agreement with a predecessor agency.  Accreditation, including that provided by some of the predecessor agencies, is, by its nature, time-limited and subject to renewal.  It is not a permanent status attributed to a provider.  Re-engagement with such 'legacy' providers involves agreeing revised quality assurance procedures in accordance with specified requirements set down in the 2012 Act and in QQI policy.  The one-off re-engagement fee to be applied to legacy providers seeking to re-engage with QQI has yet to be determined.</p><p>Regarding providers in the Community and Voluntary Sector specifically referred to by the Deputy, it was agreed at a meeting hosted by my Department in December 2014 that 2015 would be a lead-in time for the re-engagement process and that the issue of fees for community and voluntary providers would not arise until 2016. </p><p>QQI established a Joint QQI /Community and Voluntary Working Group, which is facilitated by an independent facilitator with extensive experience in the community voluntary sector. The working group has met on 5 occasions this year, with a further meeting scheduled this month.  The working group also jointly hosted a consultative event on QQI's quality assurance guidelines and criteria relevant to this sector on 30th June 2015. Through these initiatives, QQI and the community and voluntary sector are engaging on a range of operational, developmental and strategic matters in the specific context of quality assurance and re-engagement. The work of the group will assist QQI in clarifying its operational requirements for future re-engagement with community and voluntary sector organisations.</p></reply>

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social.</p>  <p>  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.</p>  <p>  Schools are assisted by Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2012), which was developed to implement Action 2.1 of Reach Out: the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 (HSE, 2005).</p>  <p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.</p>  <p>  It is also important that this message is conveyed to pupils at an early age. To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools have been recently produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in primary schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is "Well-being". It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of "Managing Myself" and "Staying Well". In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.</p>  <p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as "Minding Myself and Others" and "My Mental Health", and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Circular 0030/2014 sets out the policy of allocating SNA support for a newly enrolling Junior Infant who has clear and obvious need for such support e.g. a child who has a significant additional care need arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability.</p>  <p>  For those children where it is not yet clear whether difficulties will manifest in a classroom environment, the Circular states that, in general, it is expected that all primary school pupils having their first school experience will have been enrolled and will have commenced attending school before any application for SNA support will be made. Particularly in relation to possible anticipated behavioural difficulties, it is more appropriate to wait until the child begins school in order to see how they have been able to engage in the classroom.</p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA support from post primary schools the NCSE will take into account the importance of the requirement to allocate necessary care supports with the right of a child to acquire personal independence skills.</p>  <p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools, once allocated, is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual student for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of the student referred to in Deputy's question these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

The EU rules and regulations governing the programme allow for expenditure to end 2015. In this regard, Local Action Group contracts expire on 31 December 2015 and accordingly all projects must be completed, claimed and paid to the promoter by this date.  All project promoters have been advised by Local Action Groups of this date.</p>  <p>  My Department recently notified Local Action Groups, including Louth Leader Partnership, that it will provide transitional administration funding from January to March 2016 to allow for the orderly closure of the current programme.

In July 2015, I announced funding approval of over &euro;150 million under the Scheme nationally, to deliver over 1,000 new social housing units. This included 31 new units across 3 projects that were prioritised by Clare County Council, at an overall cost of &euro;2.416 million.  While the project in question was not announced for funding approval at that time, it remains under consideration. My Department has sought clarification in relation to a number of aspects of the project and it will be further considered when responses are received.</p>  <p>  To date my Department has not provided funding for the acquisition or re-development of Mountshannon House, which is owned by Respond Housing Association and any payments being made are a matter for Clare County Council and Respond Housing Association.</p></reply>

Of the total 6,574 units identified nationally, 4,048 are no longer available for social housing purposes for a variety of reasons. 2,469 of these properties were considered by local authorities to be unsuitable for social housing because of sustainable planning and housing policy issues associated with the units, or the units were located in areas with no social housing demand. A further 1,579 units originally identified as available for social housing were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable.</p><p>Since the process began, up to end of September 2015, a total of 1,600 NAMA residential properties have been delivered for social housing use, comprising of 1,241 completed properties, with a further 359 that have been contracted and where completion work is on-going. A further 486 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal is being carried out. An additional 440 properties are to be further appraised.</p><p>The process of reviewing units previously deemed unsuitable by local authorities is on-going. Local Authorities, particularly those in high demand areas, are continually reviewing the list of available NAMA properties to see if they are suitable to be brought into use as social housing.</p><p>Overall, I expect that in excess of 2,000 units for social housing purposes will be secured from the engagement with NAMA.  Full details of units offered and delivered under this process including a breakdown by Local Authority is available on the website of the Housing Agency at <i>/NAMA.</i></p></reply>

Social housing is procured in accordance with the relevant EU and domestic legislative and policy requirements as determined by the National Public Procurement Policy Guidance and Capital Works Management Framework published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The prevailing economic conditions at present suggest that housing costs, including social housing costs, are more likely to rise rather than fall during 2016. This is due to the fact that housing supply currently falls significantly short of housing demand and construction input costs are subject to inflationary pressures, as the construction industry transitions from under-activity over an extended period to significant growth in all sectors (i.e. residential, commercial and civil construction).</p><p>It is not possible, however, to state the estimated future average cost of construction of social housing units given the range of factors that apply. Over and above cost issues, the nature of the social housing units that might be developed in any one year, as well as their location and various other factors, will all impact on such a figure.

Section 19 of the Act provides that in setting the rent under a tenancy, whether at the outset or by way of a review, the rent must not be greater than the market rent. Section 20 provides for the frequency with which rent reviews may occur.  On 10 November 2015, Government approval was given to a package of measures to address rent stability and housing supply. In relation to rent stability, the measures were given effect by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015. This Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a four year period. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.</p><p>Further amendments in the Act regarding rent and tenancies will be the subject of commencement orders. Details of the full package of new rent stability and housing supply measures are available at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing rising rents is increasing the supply of housing and Government is addressing this on a number of fronts, including Construction 2020; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector and the Social Housing Strategy 2020. The package of measures announced on 10 November will act to stabilise rents in the short to medium term while the additional supply of housing comes on stream.</p></reply>

There are three separate grants available and local authorities receive an overall allocation, with the responsibility for the apportionment between the three schemes being a matter for each authority.  Information on the exchequer funding provided by my Department to each local authority for these grants is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<i>, </i>by selecting &lsquo;Social and Affordable Housing&rsquo;, &lsquo;Housing Adaptation Grants by Area 2008 to date&rsquo;.

As the funding provided in 2011 was &euro;76m, additional funding of &euro;25.5m would be required to restore funding to that level. I am aware of the social benefit accruing from these schemes in terms of facilitating the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability and a further funding increase of 10% is proposed for the grants in 2016.</p><p>In addition, some changes were introduced to the grants in January 2014 following a review carried out in 2013. These changes are spreading the benefits of the grants as widely as possible and improving fairness and value for money in their operation. This approach, combined with the additional funding being provided, will see over 8,500 households benefit from the grants in 2016.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.  The Act applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions which are set out in section 3(2) of the Act.  Where a dwelling is occupied by a person under an arrangement or agreement which is not a tenancy or under a tenancy to which the Act does not apply, such as instances where a <i>bona fide</i>licensing arrangement exists, the PRTB does not have any function in the registration of such agreements or arrangements.</p><p>In circumstances where it is unclear as to whether a particular rental agreement is a tenancy or a licence, the PRTB can adjudicate on the question and has done so in the past. Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord&rsquo;s wrongful claim of licence, the PRTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.</p></reply>

An ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting for the least energy efficient social houses was introduced in 2013, with &euro;77 million funding being provided by my Department from 2013 to 2015. This has resulted in improved Building Energy Ratings and comfort levels in over 30,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy efficiency targets for 2020. </p><p>A programme of remediation and energy efficiency measures in vacant social housing was implemented from 2009-2012, under which improvements were carried out to over 7,700 social units nationally.  In 2014, a new programme to remediate vacant properties was introduced with over &euro;50 million funding being provided by my Department in 2014-2015.  Nearly 5,000 vacant units are being remediated nationally between 2014 and 2015, with a particular focus on upgrading their thermal efficiency.</p><p>The number of social housing units in Mayo that have been retrofitted under Departmental energy efficiency programmes in 2011-2014 is as follows:<table><tr><th>Vacant units retrofitted <br /><br />2011 </th><th>Vacant units retrofitted <br /><br />2012 </th><th>Fabric upgrade programme 2013 </th><th>Fabric upgrade programme 2014 </th><th>Vacant units retrofitted <br /><br />2014 </th></tr><tr><td>62 </td><td>26 </td><td>193 </td><td>131 </td><td>80 </td></tr></table>Currently my Department is not supporting any programme to remove solid fuel cookers and heating systems in existing social houses. A previous programme operated over the years 2004 to 2009 and saw local authorities upgrade the central heating of 27,750 social houses, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;140 million. </p><p>I understand that approximately 600 social housing units that are the responsibility of Mayo County Council remain to have their insulation retrofitted.  The number of units that had an oil fired central heating system installed, or had solid fuel ranges and back boilers removed in the process, are not known in my Department and are matters for Mayo County Council.</p></reply>

The Tyres Working Group was, and continues to be, an open and transparent arrangement through which stakeholders have an opportunity to shape the future of the tyre sector in Ireland. However, the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) withdrew from the Group shortly after I announced my decision to establish a full PRI for tyres and waste tyres in January 2015. My Department has been in occasional contact with the organisation since their decision to withdraw. The ITWRA continue to receive all Tyres Working Group related correspondence and on several occasions I have urged them to re-join the process and to embrace the opportunity to influence the shape of the new structures.</p>  <p>  Prior to the adoption of the current 2007 Regulations, my Department made it very clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces. It stated that if the required improvement did not happen a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model would be introduced. The Producer Responsibility Initiative report on Tyres and Waste Tyres published in November 2013 looked at the operation of the system introduced in 2007 and found:</p>  <p>- A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p>  <p>- A lack of consistent and accurate data on tyres,</p>  <p>- The system was not tracking data flows well, and</p>  <p>- Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for.</p>  <p>  In summary, this system, which has resulted in between 15&ndash;20 million tyres being dumped illegally around our country, is failing to provide a proper waste management system for tyres and cannot be allowed to continue. The tyre industry is now being asked to do what operators in other areas such as WEEE, packaging, batteries, and farm plastics have been doing for years; that is, to take responsibility for managing the waste that they produce. Economic operators who are in compliance with the Regulations have nothing to fear from the new structures.</p>  <p>  The model that is being introduced will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply to purchases of new tyres by consumers and ensure that the fee consumers pay actually goes towards its stated purpose, which is to support the environmental treatment of waste tyres. This charge varies across the country from around &euro;1.75 to as much as &euro;3.50 per tyre. As things stand, the consumer, in effect, pays twice &ndash; first, when they purchase new tyres and then, again, through their taxation when local authorities remove illegal tyre stockpiles across the country. The new system is therefore very positive from the perspective of the consumer. </p>  <p>Repak ELT, which has already replaced TRACS as the sole compliance scheme for tyres as of 1 November 2015, already has almost 200 members and the model that I am developing, which mirrors arrangements in place in 20 other EU Member States, will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association,   who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I urge both the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Irish Tyre Wholesalers &amp;amp; Retailers Association (ITWRA) to re-join the process and re-engage with my Department in finalising the details for the new regulatory regime.  In addition, my Department and Repak ELT continue to engage with representatives from the farming, construction and haulage sectors on the new arrangements.</p></reply>

Dublin City Council is also implementing a HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities.  Initially, for the purposes of the HAP statutory pilot, Limerick City and County Council have been nominated by the City and County Management Association (CCMA) as the lead authority in respect of the HAP project and are providing a transactional shared service hub for all local authorities operating HAP during the pilot phase. All HAP financial transactions, including the collection of differential rent from tenants and the payment of HAP rents directly to landlords, are being made by the transactional shared services hub.

My Department&rsquo;s Trading Online Voucher Scheme, which was launched nationally on 1 July 2014, is a key initiative under the enterprise strand of the NDS and the Action Plan for Jobs. </p><p>The scheme, which is administered in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEO), offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, coupled with training, mentoring and networking supports by the LEOs to small and micro enterprises to develop their trading online presence. Applications are received directly by individual LEOs who award the vouchers to qualifying businesses, following evaluation by an expert panel.</p><p>Trading Online Vouchers are activating small businesses from across a wide range of sectors including, retail, manufacturing, professional services, food, craft/design, tourism and leisure. By November 2015, some 1,500 businesses had completed, or were in the process of completing, their trading online projects. In addition, it is estimated that more than double that number of businesses have benefitted from advice and peer-to-peer support through their participation in the information sessions delivered by the LEOs. The roll-out of vouchers to reach the initial target of 2,000 continues nationwide. </p><p>In July last, I published a report into the enterprise impacts of the scheme which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at . The report revealed that businesses that moved online experienced an average increase in sales of 21%. Some 40% of businesses had customer interactions from new markets overseas, and over 70% of businesses surveyed expect to recruit new staff. With the potential creation of an average 1.4 new jobs per company &ndash; in businesses that employ ten staff or less &ndash; trading online is making a tangible impact on jobs and economic activity in Ireland. </p><p>The Government is committed to rolling out the scheme to more interested businesses, and to this end, I have allocated funding of &euro;3 million to deliver an additional 1,000 vouchers in 2016.</p></reply>

The nature of the enquiries has focussed mainly on the likely impact of roll-out of the Intervention Strategy on specific areas in Ireland.  Officials from the Department facilitated a meeting request from Center Parcs on 14 October 2015 to discuss the likely provision of broadband in the Longford area. The meeting was held for information sharing purposes and will not have any direct impact on the roll-out strategy for the proposed State led intervention under the NBP.</p>  <p>  The meeting afforded officials from my Department an opportunity to outline the scope and detail behind the National Broadband Plan (NBP), which encompassed both commercial investment and investment under the proposed State led intervention. </p>  <p>  Representatives from Centre Parcs presented its proposed plans along with the likely demand for the provision on high quality broadband services in Longford to their proposed development.</p>  <p>  More specifically I can confirm that high speed broadband has been extended to serve 7,100 premises to date in County Longford with a further 3,700 expected to be served over the next 18 months.

I should point out that CDM Smith has also provided advices to State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. </p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common that a broad range of parties will seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise, is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.   </p></reply>

An update in the form of an Aeronautical Notice was published in April 2014.  Details of this are available on the IAA's website at<i></i>.</p><p>The European Commission has recently indicated that a suite of European regulations governing the use of drones is being fast-tracked and is expected to be in force by end of 2016.  My Department is committed under the National Aviation Policy 2015 to continue to contribute to the EU rule making and regulatory process concerning RPAS.</p><p>In the meantime, the current safety regulation of drones in Ireland is detailed under powers in the Rockets and Small Aircraft Order of 2000 and associated guidance material.  This Order is currently being updated to include new technology aircraft, including small unmanned aircraft, i.e. drones, and is expected by year-end 2015.  The new regulations will take account of the likely provisions in next year's expected EU legislation.</p></reply>

The Plan is premised on the principle that through accessibility improvements to the public transport system for people with disabilities, access for all people will be improved.  To date, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of accessible vehicles together with improved access to much of the public transport infrastructure.  Even so, much remains to be done and work in that regard is on-going.  The Department's Accessibility Consultative Committee, which includes representatives of people with disabilities, has a key role in monitoring implementation of the Plan.  In addition, each of the main public transport companies has a Disability Users Group to advise on accessibility matters at a company level.</p></reply>

In that response, I pointed out that while I would very much welcome this proposed new route, we do not have any schemes similar to the UK Government's Regional Air Connectivity Fund and there is no Exchequer funding available to support new route start-ups. The only Exchequer funding currently available to support air services is that devoted to our two remaining PSO routes, namely Donegal/Dublin and Kerry/Dublin.</p>  <p>  However, I pointed out that the daa has a Short Haul Route Support Scheme which may be applicable to the proposed new Derry/Dublin route and I suggested that the prospective air carrier, Citywings, should discuss the potential for support from this source with the daa. I also suggested, however, that Citywings should check with the UK authorities as to whether any additional supports for this route could impact on the level of support from the UK's Connectivity Fund.</p></reply>

This follows a public consultation process on the draft Plan. All submissions received will be taken into account before the Plan is advanced to a stage where it is ready for submission to the relevant authorities for approval.  The new Management Plan will acknowledge the rights of local people and communities, who have actively participated in the successful conservation, preservation and promotion of the site with regard to sustainable socio-economic growth and development. It will also acknowledge the need for the Plan itself to assist communities to sustain and develop social cohesion and the local economy.</p>  <p>  Actions envisaged for the new Plan in that context include:</p>  <p>  -  establishing a Community Forum to discuss issues relating to the site in general and to make observations on the implementation of the Plan;</p>  <p>  -  working with the local authorities to develop a guidance document which provides advice on siting and design in relation to residential and agricultural development within the area of the site; </p>  <p>  -  working with the local authorities to facilitate consultation with applicants regarding the siting and design of developments affecting the site and the scope of any necessary impact assessments;</p>  <p>  -  working with the local authorities and other relevant agencies to promote and encourage sustainable economic development in the area, particularly in tourism and agriculture.</p>  <p>  In this way, the Plan will seek to meet, in a mutually supportive way, the provisions laid down by the relevant authorities for securing the management aims for sites of this nature, while, at the same time, ensuring that local communities and residents have an active and participative role.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the main instrument for regulating and controlling physical planning within a county is the development plan which, under the Planning and Development Acts, must be renewed every 6 years, following approval by the elected members.  The legislation provides for extensive consultation with the general public, who are offered the opportunity to make submissions or observations on draft development plans which must be considered by the planning authority.  As set out above, the Management Plan will itself seek to create effective mechanisms to assist and facilitate local residents in their interactions with the planning system.</p></reply>

I have also recognised that these Houses are often a hugely important resource for local communities and a vital attraction for tourists, which can and do contribute significantly to the local economy. It is within this context that I had the <i>Action Plan for Irish Historic Houses in Private</i>O<i>wnership</i>developed and secured Government approval for it.

In carrying out these functions, my main focus is to ensure that the victims of the Irish Famine are respectfully and appropriately remembered. In that context, I also seek to raise awareness of current food security issues worldwide.  While the Commemoration ceremony retains a degree of continuity in its format, the date and the cultural elements of the commemoration may change from year to year.  In some previous years it has proved possible to hold the annual commemoration ceremony on the second Sunday in May and I am aware that some people are of the view that the annual National Famine Commemoration should be held on the same designated day each year.</p>  <p>  However, I do not consider it desirable to fix the same date each year, given the factors that may need to be considered, such as the site selection process, the availability of the lead person to officiate at the ceremony and the general arrangements at community level.</p>  <p>  For example in 2015, due to organisational imperatives arising as a result of the staging of the event for the first time in Northern Ireland, the commemoration ceremony was held in Newry in September and proved to be a great success with significant cross-community representation.  Similarly in 2016, due to the number of events relating to the centenary of the Easter Rising scheduled to take place in March, April and May of next year, it is likely that the famine commemoration ceremony will take place later in the year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the retention of such flexibility does not detract from the key aim of the annual commemoration, which is to have a fitting national ceremony to remember and show respect for all those who died or suffered loss during the Great Famine.</p>  <p>  In fact, this flexibility facilitates the commemoration being held in the most appropriate context each year. In the circumstances, I have no plans to designate a fixed date for the national Famine Commemoration.</p></reply>

The response has been enthusiastic from all local authorities and each of the local authorities has now developed a rich and diverse series of events and projects that will take place around the country next year.  I was very pleased to participate with An Taoiseach and other Government colleagues at the official launch on 8 October last of the 31 individual county plans arising from this process.  I allocated &euro;1 million in current funding in 205  to support local authorities in this process, and on 25 October 2015, I joined the Taoiseach for the announcement of a further &euro;3 million funding package in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and IPB Insurance.  This three-fold increase in funding will help to develop and realise the plans being coordinated at a county level across the country.  My officials have notified the local authorities of their increased allocation for 2016, and I am confident that this funding will help to maximise participation in the Ireland 2016 programme throughout each county.  </p>  <p>  The local authorities are now in the process of organising individual launches, including a wide variety of events, lectures and opportunities for the public to get involved with the programme.  Further information in relation to the various events, activities and initiatives taking place under each of the above strands, including the 31 county plans launched in October, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s dedicated website at www.ireland.ie.</p></reply>

Over the past 10 years, Culture Ireland has been visible globally creating and supporting opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues.  Since 2005, Culture Ireland has promoted and supported over 7,500 Irish cultural projects and events worldwide, ranging across music, theatre, dance, literature, film, visual art and architecture.  This support has created significant goodwill and influence for Ireland and has helped to contribute to the strength of Ireland's reputation for creative excellence.  The international promotion of Irish arts through Culture Ireland continues to make significant impact internationally through its regular grant rounds and showcase programmes.  </p><p>The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period is recognised as the key time to raise the profile of Ireland and connect with new and established audiences overseas through cultural events.  Culture Ireland supports a significant Irish cultural programme each year globally, with highlights in areas with significant diaspora such as London, New York and Sydney. Locally, the Embassy network works with Culture Ireland to maximise the impact of the events around this period to celebrate and highlight our artistic strengths and build on Ireland's global reputation as a country of creativity.</p><p>For 2015, the international culture programme for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period was awarded funding in excess of &euro;200,000 to support over 50 events to take place in 22 countries.  The unique platform offered by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to highlight the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s creative sector also serves to foster tourism, business interests and inward investment.  It presents Ireland with an unrivalled opportunity to showcase our culture and our talented artists globally. </p><p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme next year, Culture Ireland will put in place a major programme to highlight Ireland's culture globally through presentation of Irish artists in high profile venues, particularly across the UK, USA, Canada and Australia.  Under the title <b><i>I am Ireland, </i></b>the programme of events, offering a contemporary Irish cultural experience globally, will ensure that the Irish arts and culture brand continues to be strong.  Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in key territories around the world has been one of this Government&rsquo;s priorities and Culture Ireland continues to play a key role in realising this objective through the strength of Ireland's global cultural offering.</p></reply>

Ireland has benefitted over the years from artistic works which have been imported into the State.  </p>  <p>  In terms of keeping objects of importance in the State, generous tax relief is provided under section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for donations to approved bodies of heritage items that are considered outstanding examples of their type, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland.  A Selection Committee chaired by my Department considers proposals for such relief.  </p>  <p>  As regards the Beit Collection, the Selection Committee has approved the proposed donation of "A Village Kermesse near Antwerp" by David Teniers II, which is valued at &euro;2 million, to the National Gallery under section 1003.  Two other proposed donations are being assessed.  In June, I asked the Alfred Beit Foundation to postpone the proposed sale of the paintings, so all options could be explored, including identifying Irish donors.  I am pleased that this approach is now yielding positive results.</p></reply>

The Programme is an invitation to everyone on the island of Ireland and to the global Irish community to shape and engage in a diverse range of historical, cultural and artistic activities &ndash; all designed to facilitate reflection, commemoration, celebration, debate and analysis and an active imagining of our future.  Officials of my Department have facilitated an intensive consultation period over the last few months, including active engagement with schools, universities, colleges, business and voluntary organisations, arts and culture institutions, historical societies, local authorities and representative groups &ndash; at home and in our Diaspora around the world &ndash; to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about 2016, and to foster programme initiatives.  Work has been ongoing to implement a comprehensive programme and planning is well underway for the range of initiatives within the seven programme strands.  </p><p>Among the key milestones achieved to date are the following:</p><p>-  I was delighted to host the first of the State ceremonial events of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme on 1 August last to commemorate the funeral of O'Donovan Rossa in Glasnevin Cemetery, in the presence of President Michael D Higgins and An Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, T.D. </p><p>-  Over 84 public consultation meetings were held with local communities all around the country. 31 individual county plans were launched on 8<sup></sup>October last containing over 1,800 events across the country.  &euro;1m was allocated to facilitate these plans this year, with a further &euro;3m to be made available next year.</p><p>-  An allocation of &euro;22 million in capital funding is being provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2015 for the &lsquo;Permanent Reminder&rsquo; projects, with a further &euro;31m being provided next year. These capital projects are progressing well.</p><p>-  The Global and Diaspora Programme was launched on 29 June and was very positively received at home and abroad.</p><p>-  On 6<sup></sup>August, the Arts Council announced 9 major arts projects to commemorate 1916.  </p><p>-  The National Flag Initiative was launched on 14 September, marking the commencement of the delivery by the Defence Forces of our National Flag and the Proclamation to over 3,300 national schools across the country.  Well over 2,000 flags have now been delivered and the project has been very well received.  </p><p>-  The Irish Language strand - <i>An Teanga Bheo</i>- was launched at the end of October by An Taoiseach. </p><p>-  The Education Programme strand was launched on 22 September for the primary, post-primary and third-level education sectors.</p><p>-  Consultation is ongoing with relevant stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including official, political, media, artistic and NGO stakeholders. </p><p>-  The National Cultural Institutions are planning a range of innovative exhibitions and projects and all are progressing well.  The National Library launched its 2016 plans just yesterday.</p><p>-  The official Culture Ireland programme <i>&ldquo;I am Ireland&rdquo;</i>was launched by Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on 3<sup></sup>October.  This will showcase the best of Irish arts and culture on the international stage.</p><p>-  On 10 November, I announced that work was to start on the development of the new Commemorative Centre at the National Monument in Moore Street, which was acquired by the State earlier in the year.</p><p>Further information in relation to the various events, activities and initiatives taking place under each of 7 strands of the Programme, including the 31 county plans launched in October, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s dedicated website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

My Department also operates small capital grants schemes, which require to be co-funded from private or philanthropic sources.  The Arts Council operates the RAISE programme, which seeks to enhance fund-raising skills in arts organisations with a view to reducing the sector&rsquo;s dependency on funding from the taxpayer and moving it more towards the business sector.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) &ndash; in this case, Kildare County Council.  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  </p><p>Grant funding of &euro;624,000 was allocated for the Structures at Risk Fund 2015<i>, </i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration and which are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This fund, which is administered through the local authorities, encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  Since 2011, over 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>My Department has a number of measures at its disposal to facilitate the restoration of major historical or cultural sites.  I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians.  A wide range of other monuments (in the order of 130,000) are currently subject to protection under other provisions of the National Monuments Acts but my Department and the Office of Public Works do not have a direct role in their maintenance, except where, as already noted, a monument is a national monument of which I am owner or guardian.  </p><p>My Department is also providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2015 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership. </p><p>Finally, in October this year I announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures in 2016.  This allocation from Capital Stimulus funding will assist with works to safeguard structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014 and invested &euro;5 million nationally in our built heritage leveraging an additional &euro;10 million, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries.  It will help to regenerate urban and rural areas and will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.</p><p>Well maintained historic buildings contribute positively to the vitality of our cities, towns, villages and countryside.  Local communities have a great sense of pride in their built heritage, which in turns can help to provide an important source of local employment by boosting tourism.</p></reply>

For completeness, I would bring to the Deputy's attention that my Department makes payments from time to time to the Chief State Solicitor's Office in respect of legal services that it provides to my Department.  The Deputy may also wish to refer to my reply to Question Number 642 of 1 December which details costs of &euro;225,100 incurred in respect of legal cases brought against my Department.</p>  <p>  Bodies operating under the aegis of my Department are separate legal entities in their own right.  The issues raised by the Deputy are part of the day-to-day operational responsibilities of the bodies in question and are matters for the bodies concerned.</p></reply>
