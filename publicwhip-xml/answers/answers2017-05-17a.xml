This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade, and provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, who share deep historic ties, and enjoy strong trading relations.  Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants.  Today, over four and a half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population - claim Irish ancestry.</p><p>During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto, and met with a number of existing and potential new IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies.  These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and to outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit.</p><p>While in Montreal, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau.  We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment.  We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the CETA trade agreement.  I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland.  The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process<font color="#FF1F35">.</font></p><p>Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community, where I met with potential and current investors in Ireland.  I also visited the School of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met with members of the Irish Diaspora.</p><p>In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event, and also an event hosted by the Ireland-Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me opportunities to meet with current and potential investors in Ireland.  I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial park in Toronto.  I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell.  My Programme concluded with a meeting with members of the Board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish Diaspora, and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada. </p><p>This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada - and I expect will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by Minister Mitchell O'Connor later this month (30 May to 02 June).</p></reply>

I wrote to Party Leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate.  Contacts are continuing with parties to finalise nominations with a view to having the Group up and running as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Also, the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to developing this Institute.  It is foreseen that the new Institute will have international standing and contribute to the overall development of knowledge and experience in the areas of peace support, leadership and conflict resolution.</p>  <p>  Scoping work was carried out on the proposal throughout 2016.  A concept paper has been developed and some initial consultation with national and international third level and research institutes and potential philanthropic contributors has also taken place.</p>  <p>  Arising from the initial scoping work and consultations, it has been decided to progress to conduct a feasibility study.  Terms of reference for this feasibility study are being finalised and I expect that the study will commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

On receipt of approval for payment of the additional amount, the Department issued instructions to its payroll provider &ndash; the Payroll Shared Services Centre (PSSC) &ndash; to make the payments due.  The amounts involved were included with pay for serving personnel on the weekly payroll of 3 May 2017.  Work is ongoing on the payment of amounts due to a small number of former personnel who have left the Permanent Defence Force and are no longer on the payroll system. </p>  <p>  In the case of the Operation Pontus allowance, the arrears would normally have been paid within a shorter period after receipt of approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, in this particular case, payment was not made during April due to the migration, during April, of the Permanent Defence Force enlisted personnel payroll to the Department&rsquo;s new payroll provider &ndash; the Payroll Shared Services Centre.</p>  <p>  This significant project required the putting in place of revised payroll arrangements during April on a once off basis, including the temporary re-scheduling of payroll deadlines. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that this matter of the additional payment has now been concluded.</p></reply>

While this was an introductory meeting, a comprehensive range of issues in relation to peacekeeping operations were discussed.  I also took the opportunity to brief him on my recent visit to Ireland&rsquo;s troops serving on UN peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and in the Golan Heights.</p>  <p>  Under Secretary General Lacroix welcomed Irish/Finnish cooperation in UNIFIL and expressed his appreciation for Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing support to the mission.  Our discussion addressed the recently published UN Strategic Review of UNIFIL which determined that UNIFIL is well configured to implement its mandated tasks and continues to be a credible, flexible and mobile force.  That Review also states that the overall strategic political guidance is to maintain UNIFIL at its current strength, composition and configuration and it was clear from our discussion that the UN Under Secretary General supports this view.     </p>  <p>  With regard to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) mission, we were in agreement that the presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring the continuing ceasefire between Israel and Syria and in the wider Middle East Region.  The valuable contribution that the Defence Forces are making to this mission was acknowledged.  The UN Under Secretary took note of the security concerns I outlined regarding the return of troops to the Area of Separation. </p>  <p>  We spoke about the recent debate on Peacekeeping Operations in the UN Security Council.  Under Secretary General Lacroix indicated that while challenges were identified in terms of funding, the added value of Peacekeeping Operations was acknowledged.  He is confident, however, that the UN can achieve efficiencies, while maintaining the effectiveness of UN operations. </p>  <p>  In relation to Mali, Under Secretary General Lacroix agreed with my assessment that the challenges there are wide ranging and require a wider response than can be delivered by peacekeeping operations alone. </p>  <p>  It was a very worthwhile meeting and I look forward to having further discussions with the UN Under Secretary General in the future.</p></reply>

The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis.  In non-crisis situations, the main focus will be on training to prepare for this role.  The White Paper on Defence also noted that members of the RDF continue to play an important role in contributing to State ceremonial events.  The Government values this contribution and decided that it should be assigned as a formal role for the Reserve.</p>  <p>  Recruitment to both the PDF and RDF remains a priority in 2017.  Membership of the RDF is voluntary and unpaid and the quest for recruits must compete with the other organisations within the voluntary sector.  These conditions along with the unique demands of military service make the issue of attracting recruits to the Reserve a challenging one.  This challenge is not unique to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the context of both finite resources and personnel, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of PDF and RDF recruitment, so as to deliver the desired effects of maintaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned to it by Government and to advance the single force structure.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated the next RDF recruitment campaign will commence in the second half of 2017.  Until then the RDF will continue to induct from the 2015/2016 panel.  The Defence Forces are reviewing the 2015/2016 RDF competition and as part of this process are examining the competition model to be used in 2017.  I wish to see an acceleration in the rate of recruitment to the Reserve within the available means and resources.</p></reply>

It also considers the defence capabilities required so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government.</p>  <p>  In this context, the White Paper on Defence also highlights a number of medium and long term strategies in the area of manpower planning.  The White Paper addresses the need to review and develop rolling medium term planning requirements so as to deliver an effective and efficient workforce mix in terms of age profile, skills, competencies and experience, and current policies to support this will be further developed and implemented.  To that end, a number of White Paper projects are currently underway and are being jointly developed by military and civil personnel.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, the manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that a total of 590 General Service Recruits were enlisted into the Permanent Defence Force in 2016, of which 501 Recruits were enlisted in the Army and 89 Recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service.  In addition, 100 Cadetships were awarded following the   2016 Cadetship Competitions.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that their planned target is to induct approximately 8 50 new entrants to the Defence Forces across all services and competition streams in 2017.</p>  <p>  A new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017 and the 2017 Cadetship competition was launched in March 2017.  Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  An Air Corps apprentice class was also inducted in March 2017. </p>  <p>  Promotions are ongoing within Officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies.  A new NCO promotions competition to fill vacancies to the ranks of Sergeants and above has been launched from which promotions will commence in Q3 2017.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to increasing recruitment to the Defence Forces and it is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue to be carried out within the resource envelope allocated to Defence and in the context of the policy and strategy regarding recruitment set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p></reply>

Procurement procedures in the Defence Forces are kept under constant review to ensure they are in line with best practice, guidance and the legal framework.</p>  <p>  A wide range of non-capital goods and services are procured directly by the Defence Forces.  These include items associated with day-to-day operations such as food, clothing, transport, utilities and the maintenance of equipment and premises.  The services of the Office of Government Procurement and centralised framework agreements are also used to acquire items that may be in common demand in the Public Sector.  Other programmes of expenditures such as capital expenditure on major defensive equipment platforms for the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps are managed by officials in my Department.  However, in practice there is close civil-military collaboration on a daily basis in respect of a variety of procurement projects. </p>  <p>  The procurement policies, procedures and applicable legislation in place are designed to ensure that the highest standards of integrity, fairness, legality, confidentiality and disclosure of interest are applied to all procurement related transactions.  All relevant procurement regulations including those set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines &ndash; Competitive Process are applied to ensure that competition is promoted, value for money secured and openness and transparency assured. </p>  <p>  Public procurement rules are adapted to the specificities of defence procurements, which can be particularly complex and sensitive.  Procurement of defence and security equipment such as weapons, munitions and material for defence purposes is carried out in accordance with EU Directive 2009/90/EC.  This is a specific Directive relating to the award of contracts dealing with the defence and security area which provides rules that enhance transparency and openness in defence markets while also ensuring that individual countries&rsquo; security concerns are protected.  This Directive was transposed into Irish law by way of implementing S.I. No. 62 of 2012. </p>  <p>  Procurement is also carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Public Spending Code, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Code is designed to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for resources at its disposal.  The requirements of the Code are based on employing best practices at all stages of the equipment expenditure cycle. </p>  <p>  Procedures are in place in the Defence Organisation to provide a forum for oversight and approval of expenditure and to ensure that expenditure is profiled and monitored on an ongoing basis.  In this regard a High Level Planning and Procurement Group (HLPPG) comprising of senior civil and military management of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and an associated Working Group meet on a monthly basis.  The Group also develops and implements multi-annual rolling plans for the Defence Forces for equipment procurement and disposal and infrastructural development (including property acquisition) based on the policy priorities in the White Paper.   </p>  <p>  I am advised that procurement procedures in the Defence Forces are kept under constant review to support good procurement practice, project management and good corporate governance, and to ensure that tender processes are carried out in an appropriate manner.</p></reply>

In this context, the White Paper sets out the investment priorities for the Air Corps.  A unique feature of Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy is the extent to which these capabilities are used towards other ends.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that while the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, the Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Principle Response Agency in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in an Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps provided assistance to the emergency services fighting gorse and forest fires in Counties Sligo and Galway in recent weeks dropping approximately 197,000 litres of water onto the fires. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps utilised the AW139 helicopter in the fire fighting role using the &ldquo;bambi bucket&rdquo; to deliver water to the scene of the fire.  The bucket can carry up to 1,200 litres of water at a time.  This water can be delivered by the helicopter quickly and accurately, and is particularly useful when dealing with fires in remote areas. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps also deployed an EC-135 helicopter to facilitate command and control of the fire fighting operation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might also note that, in addition to Air Corp s assistance, 49 personnel drawn from Renmore Barracks (An Chead Cathlan Cois) were also deployed to assist with fire-fighting efforts in Oughterard Co. Galway.  These personnel  were also operating in an Aid to Civil Authority capacity and they assisted with the suppression of secondary fires.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces continue to be developed in line with requirements needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

This includes undertaking overseas Peace Support Operations, and in this regard to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on all missions.</p>  <p>  The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement directives, including the Directive on the procurement of Defensive and Security Equipment.   </p>  <p>  Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions.  There are no such restrictions or embargos in place on Israeli companies.</p>  <p>  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.</p>  <p>  The value of contracts for equipment, goods or services procured from Israeli based firms and companies since 2012 is &euro;5.86m, this includes the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles currently operated by the Defence Forces, commonly referred to as UAVs.</p>  <p>  These UAVs, are, in effect, an information gathering asset which have no offensive capability.  They do not carry weapons.  The UAV systems were acquired to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance, intelligence gathering and target acquisition for Peace Support Operations and provide a low cost, low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions which do not demand the use of manned aircraft.   </p>  <p>  UAVs have a wide range of civilian and military applications, particularly in the area of surveillance over land and sea.  They have the ability to perform tasks that manned systems cannot perform, either for safety or for economic reasons.  UAVs can efficiently complement existing manned aircraft or satellites infrastructure used in environmental protection, maritime surveillance, natural disasters, crisis management, border control, etc. </p>  <p>  Following a competitive tender process, 4 UAV Systems were procured between 2007 and 2009 from Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd based in Israel.  An upgrade of the Defence Forces UAV systems was carried out by the original equipment manufacturer in 2016 at a cost of &euro;1.9m ex VAT.  This involved the upgrade of 4 UAV systems, with 3 airframes in each system.</p>  <p>  The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit. </p>  <p>  Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. </p>  <p>  The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargos.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect.</p></reply>

In accordance with the revised organisational structures, as of 30 November 2012 the establishment for Units based in Custume Barracks is 995 personnel. </p>  <p>  The effect of the re-organisation on Custume Barracks is that the actual number of PDF personnel based in Custume Barracks has been stabilised within an overall strength ceiling of 9,500 PDF personnel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that no member of the Defence Forces is exclusively or permanently based in any one location, including Custume Barracks.  There is a constant through-flow of personnel into and out of Custume Barracks and indeed other Barracks.  This is because military service involves personnel moving into and out of particular postings as they serve at home and overseas, receive training and undergo educational and career development courses.</p>  <p>  As has been previously stated at meetings between my officials and local representatives regarding the matter of Custume Barracks, I am committed to the future of the facility as an important, operational military Barracks.

This was an informal meeting and as such no decisions are taken on any matter.</p><p>On 26 April, Ministers received a briefing from Operation Commander, Rear Admiral Enrico Credendino on 'Operation Sophia', which is the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers.  The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 2292 (UNSCR 2292).  UNSCR 2292 imposes an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related materiel into that country.</p><p>On 27th April, Ministers discussed and exchanged views on:</p><p>-  Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations with a focus on Libya, the Mediterranean Naval CSDP mission 'Operation Sophia' and CSDP missions in the Sahel.</p><p>-  Ongoing work on Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO).</p><p>-  Ongoing work on the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).Ongoing work by the Commission on their European Defence Action Plan (EDAP), including the proposal for a European Defence Fund.</p><p>-  The issue of strengthening the EU 's Rapid Response toolbox, including EU Battlegroups, in particular to reinforce their modularity, preparation and effective financing. </p><p>In the margins of the meeting I met with the UN Under Secretary General (UN/USG), Mr Jean-Pierre Lacroix where <i>inter alia</i>we had a detailed exchange of views in relation to Peacekeeping Operations, in particular UNIFIL, UNDOF and MINUSMA, UN support for EU Battle Groups and funding to the United Nations.</p></reply>

Also of significance however, is the fact that the re-organisation has led to an improvement in the deployability and sustainability of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas, and has allowed it to continue to fulfil all roles assigned in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  One of the roles assigned is to provide Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) supports to lead agencies responsible for dealing with emergencies.  Although the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, the Defence Forces have provided very significant assistance to the emergency services fighting gorse and forest fires in Counties Sligo and Galway in recent weeks.  In this regard, an Air Corps AW139 helicopter dropped approximately 197,000 litres of water onto the fires whilst an EC-135 helicopter facilitated command and control of the fire fighting operation.  In addition to the Air Corps assistance, 49 army personnel were deployed to assist with the fire fighting effort in Oughterard, Co. Galway.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces made a very significant contribution in support of the emergency services and that the 2012 re-organisation has not diminished the response capabilities of the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The mission is also providing capacity building and training to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy and contributing to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 2292 (UNSCR 2292).  UNSCR 2292 imposes an arms embargo on Libya in an effort to prevent the flow of illicit arms and related materiel into that country.</p>  <p>  The Council Decision to launch the mission was adopted at the formal Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 22 June 2015.</p>  <p>  Operation Sophia is being implemented in sequential phases.  The first phase, to support the detection and monitoring of migration networks through information gathering and patrolling in accordance with international law, is complete.  The second phase involving the targeting, seizure and diversion of the vessels of human smugglers and traffickers remains ongoing.  The third phase, will involve taking all necessary measures against vessels including disposal or rendering them inoperable.  No political discussions have yet taken place at EU level on the commencement of the third phase.  The requirement for a UN Security Council Resolution or consent of coastal State also applies to the third phase, neither of which is in place. </p>  <p>  While Ireland is fully supportive of the EU approach to the migration crisis, we have not, to date, participated in this EU military mission.</p>  <p>  The question of any future deployment to the EU mission and the nature of any such deployment will be examined in the context of the outcome of a Strategic Review of Operation Sophia, which is currently underway, the nature and mandate of the EU mission following review, the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto.  Other factors to be taken into consideration include the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources.  The Strategic Review of Operation Sophia is expected to be completed by mid year.</p>  <p>  Any plans to deploy 12 or more naval service personnel and/or a naval vessel to participate as part of EUNAVFOR MED, Operation Sophia would be subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.   </p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, Ireland has undertaken a humanitarian search and rescue mission in the Mediterranean in 2015 and 2016 called Operation Pontus.  This humanitarian mission has resulted in the rescue of over 15,600 migrants to date.</p>  <p>  On 11 April 2017, the Government approved the return of a Naval vessel to the Mediterranean to continue to undertake humanitarian search and rescue tasks.  The Government decision provided that the deployment is subject to finalisation of a bilateral arrangement with the Italian authorities in relation to the operation of the mission and the landing of persons rescued.  A date for deployment of the Naval vessel will be determined when the diplomatic arrangements have been completed.</p></reply>

It notes that the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for protecting the internal security of the State.  The Defence Forces provide, on request, supports in aid to the civil power (ATCP) of an ongoing and contingent nature.  </p>  <p>  In this context, the security environment is kept under constant review.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can request a broad range of supports from the Defence Forces including Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and the Army Ranger Wing.  On-going coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, based on ongoing threat assessments, the Garda&iacute; and the Defence Forces liaise with regard to possible Defence Forces supports required for a range of contingencies.  In this context, I can confirm that there is very active cooperation between an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces including exercises. </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence set the defence capability agenda for the next decade.  In recognising the dynamic nature of the security environment, the Government decided that the Defence Forces would continue to retain a range of flexible conventional military capabilities, in order to meet the roles assigned and as a hedge to future uncertainty. </p>  <p>  There are a broad range of White Paper projects currently being implemented which are intended to identify, and develop and maintain such capabilities.  It remains a top priority for me and my Department to implement the White Paper projects and ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

While the implications for the border will emerge during the course of the negotiations, it is this Government&rsquo;s stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. </p><p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners.  The fact of a UK exit from the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements at this time. </p><p>  The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review.  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place.</p><p>In recent years a range of measures have been introduced in order to ensure that operational readiness and deployability of the Defence Forces are maintained to the greatest extent possible.  These measures included barrack closures and the consolidation of three under-strength Army Brigades into two revised Army Brigades.  This involved a re-deployment of personnel from HQ and administrative posts into front-line operational Units, which has improved the overarching capacity of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the White Paper on Defence sets out an appropriate blueprint for the development of the Defence Forces.  There are currently no plans to redeploy personnel in counties Cavan, Monaghan or the greater border region.</p></reply>

The guidelines reflect Ireland's unique concerns - support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process; avoid a hard border; and protect the Common Travel Area. </p>  <p>  They also recognise the desirability of moving to discuss the future relationship between the EU and the UK once sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal issues, as well as the likely need for transitional arrangements.  Furthermore, the statement agreed by the European Council acknowledges that in the event of a united Ireland, brought about in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would legally be part of the EU. </p>  <p>  This outcome is a major endorsement of Government's approach, and results from an intensive engagement with EU partners and institutions at all political and official levels in recent months. </p>  <p>  Now that the overall approach to the negotiations has been set out by the EU, the Government has stated its intention to intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise. </p>  <p>  To underpin this work, the Government will prepare a further paper on the economic implications of the Brexit challenge.  This will draw on the extensive work already underway across Departments, including sectoral analyses, and will reflect the core economic themes of my speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs of 15 February, including:</p>  <p> - sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit</p>  <p> - policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness</p>  <p> - prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit</p>  <p> - realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and helpful businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising; </p>  <p> - making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  Policy decisions in support of these objectives arise across a wide range of areas, including the annual Budgetary process; the forthcoming National Planning Framework 2040; the new 10-year National Capital Plan; the review of Enterprise 2025; and sectoral policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy. </p>  <p>  In taking this important work forward, the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders, including through the All Island Civic Dialogue process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-17a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017051700073#WRE01300"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s Comprehensive Employment Strategy, which was was launched by An Taoiseach in October 2015, provides a cross-government approach focusing on actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.  The purpose of the Strategy is to address the under-representation of people with disabilities in the labour force, and sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so.  Co-ordination of the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation is the responsibility of the Equality Division in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers</p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy, an oversight implementation group was established under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay.  This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the above six strategic priorities of the strategy, ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets.  The Chair of the Group recently published the Annual Report, which highlighted areas where greater progress needs to be made, and which also included recommendations in relation to priorities for 2017.</p><p>The Strategy contains a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  Of particular relevance to people with autism are:</p><p>- The establishment of special public service competitions for people with disabilities and where appropriate, the provision of alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities into the public service.  Discussions in relation to this commitment are underway between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>- A national employer helpline, which was launched in January 2016, to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.  </p><p>- An increase in the pubic sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, with work beginning on this later in the year. </p><p>The helpline was established by the employer bodies with support from the National Disability Authority and the Authority works with them to ensure greater awareness amongst and support for employers in employing people with disabilities, including those on the autism spectrum.  </p><p>I might also mention the Action Plan on Autism, which the Department of Justice and Equality developed in conjunction with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  The NDA monitors the implementation of the Plan and has initiated a number of actions relating to the Plan, including:</p><p>- Improving customer services for persons with disabilities with a specific focus on autism; </p><p>- Launching an online autism friendly public services training course; </p><p>- Providing training courses on autism friendly public services in connection with the autism advocacy and support organisation AsIAm to specific public services providers (e.g. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, transport providers etc.);</p><p>- Updating and monitoring compliance with the statutory Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information provided by Public Bodies, with a specific focus on autism.</p><p>The Department is responsible for several specific objectives contained in the Plan including:</p><p>- Raising disability awareness, including the dissemination of autism related materials; </p><p>- Engaging, supporting and providing guidance to people with autism who come in contact with the criminal justice system; </p><p>- Working with the NDA to review the impact of disability related policy and legislation.</p><p>Full implementation of the Action Plan on Autism is one of the actions contained in the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017- 2021, which it is expected will be published soon.</p></reply>

Another office, the Refugee Documentation Centre, provides information services to all of the bodies involved in international protection cases.  I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that the number of additional staff recruited to date and engaged in the provision of services in the area of International Protection is 13.  As I stated in my response to the Deputy's Question of 30 March 2017, individual staff members can be involved in both international protection and other civil legal aid work.  Some newly-recruited staff engaged in the provision of services in the area of international protection commenced employment during 2016; I understand that these staff were assigned in preparation for the commencement of the single application procedure.  The Board continues to monitor staffing needs, capacity, and demand for services so that it can recruit and place staff, if necessary, where they will be most effective.  </p><p>As previously stated,<b></b>while the Board has staff that are specifically assigned to the area of international protection, it also provides legal services in relation to a range of important civil issues including, for example, legal services to parents whose children may be subject to care orders.  While the Board is developing specialisation in its staff, it is also wishes to ensure flexibility in order to address areas of particular priority at a point in time.  For that reason, some new staff engaged in the provision of services in the international protection area also have a wider civil element to their role.  </p><p>The Board is committed to giving early legal advice to persons seeking international protection and to ensuring that those persons see a solicitor prior to their interview with the International Protection Office.  I am further informed that the Board is currently finalising its model of service delivery and clarifying expectations regarding staff output, performance and value for money.  When this process is finalised any further requirement will be considered but the Board is satisfied that the current demand for services is being met and there is no backlog of applicants waiting for international protection services.  As is usual in such circumstances, the situation is being kept under active review.  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board is subject to a range of statutory and governance obligations including the 2016 <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies</i>. </p><p>Details of the 13 staff members are set out in the following table. <table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Start Date</th></tr><tr><td>Legal Clerk</td><td>04/01/2016</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Clerk</td><td>11/01/2016</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>18/01/2016</td></tr><tr><td>Solicitor</td><td>28/06/2016</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>04/07/2016</td></tr><tr><td>EO</td><td>19/09/2016</td></tr><tr><td>EO</td><td>01/11/2016</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>02/01/2017</td></tr><tr><td>HEO</td><td>13/01/2017</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Clerk</td><td>23/01/2017</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>30/01/2017</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>06/02/2017</td></tr><tr><td>CO</td><td>06/02/2017</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that its clear preference is always to work with taxpayers experiencing cash-flow difficulties and where possible agree mutually acceptable payment solutions. </p><p>Revenue has confirmed that it only uses its Attachment powers in the more egregious cases and where standard enforcement options such as Sheriff or external solicitor fail to secure collection.

While the Ready Reckoner does not show all of the specific costings requested by the Deputy, other changes can be estimated on a pro-rata basis with those displayed in the Reckoner. </p><p>In relation to the second question, I am informed by Revenue that the first and full year cost of introducing an additional tax band in the manner outlined by the Deputy is estimated to be in the order of &euro;165 million and &euro;191 million respectively.</p><p>These figures and all figures provided in the Ready Reckoner are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes.  They are provisional and may be revised.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC) as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  The Programme for Government therefore incudes a commitment not to index tax credits or rate bands.  Indexation of the income tax standard-rate bands would benefit only those currently paying income tax at the higher rate &ndash; i.e. single individuals earning over &euro;33,800 and single-income married couples earning over &euro;42,800.  It is estimated that in 2017, 21% of taxpayer units will pay income tax at the higher rate.  Indexation of the standard rate bands would therefore be of benefit to only 21% of taxpayers.</p><p>I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so.  Budget 2017 has, for the third year in succession, introduced reductions in the income tax burden for all those within the scope of USC with the three lowest rates of USC having been reduced over these years from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2.5% and 5% respectively.  This is important progress in making work pay and supporting individuals returning to and remaining in employment. </p><p>In this regard the Income Tax Reform Plan developed for consultation with the Oireachtas, published in July last year, may be of interest, and is available at the following link: <i> </i></p></reply>

The CCMA provides that a lender must ensure that it has in place a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as a framework for handling cases.  The first step in the MARP process is communication with the borrower.  </p>  <p>   Under the CCMA, a lender is required to produce and implement a policy, approved by the board of directors, regarding communications with borrowers.  Further the CCMA provides that a lender must ensure that the level of communications from the lender, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the borrowers, including that unnecessarily frequent communications are not made.  The lender must also ensure that communications with borrowers are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing and that borrowers are given sufficient time to complete an action they have committed to before follow up communication is attempted.  Steps must also be taken to agree future communication with borrowers.  A lender must maintain records of all communications with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre arrears.  </p>  <p>  For mortgages in arrears that do not fall within the scope of the CCMA, lenders are required to comply with the arrears handling provisions of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (&lsquo;the Code&rsquo;).  The relevant provisions as regards &lsquo;Arrears Handling&rsquo; are contained in Chapter 10 of the Code.  The Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that the level of contact and communications with a personal consumer in arrears is proportionate and not excessive.  Each calendar month, no more than three unsolicited communications to a personal consumer in respect of arrears, by whatever means, can be initiated.  This does not include any communication that has been requested by, or agreed in advance with, the personal consumer; and any communication to the personal consumer the sole purpose of which is to comply with the requirements of the Code or other regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  If a consumer is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with him/her, or believes that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank codes and regulations, the consumer should firstly make a complaint to the regulated entity.  Under the Consumer Protection Code (Provisions 10.7 to 10.12), regulated entities must have a complaints procedure in place and must handle complaints speedily, efficiently and fairly.  If a consumer is not happy with the response he/she receives from the regulated entity they can, provided the conduct complained of occurred within the last six years, escalate their complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).  The FSO has the statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial services providers. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that it has a wide range of tools at its disposal to investigate and take action against regulated entities and/or individuals which fall short of its' expected standards of behaviour, up to and including, where appropriate, administrative sanctions (which can include fines and other penalties) under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 in the case of a contravention of the above requirements.</p></reply>

The Central Bank is the statutory supervisory and enforcement authority for regulated financial services providers in Ireland, and it is also responsible for protecting the consumer of financial services.  As such, it is the independent responsibility of the Central Bank to ensure that financial institutions and individuals are held accountable for their compliance with anti-money laundering ("AML") and countering the financing of terrorism ("CFT") preventative obligations set out in Criminal Justice Act 2010 (CJA 2010).</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that its recent investigation into designated persons' compliance with AML and CFT preventative obligations was conducted under the Central Bank's Administrative Sanctions Procedure (ASP) as per Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.</p>  <p>  One of the relevant AML/CFT breaches for an ASP case can be a breach of section 42 of the CJA 2010, which requires designated persons to submit a suspicious transaction report ("STR") to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the Revenue Commissioners "as soon as practicable".  Designated persons are obliged to submit STRs where a suspicion or knowledge of money laundering or terrorist financing arises during the course of business.</p>  <p>  For the purpose of clarification, an investigation under ASP is not a criminal investigation.  The Central Bank's supervisory remit is to monitor credit and financial institutions for compliance with AML/CFT control measures.  It has not a statutory remit to investigate or prosecute substantive money laundering or terrorist financing offences.  Any fine that is imposed for AML/CFT breaches by the Central Bank under ASP relates to control breaches and not to actual money laundering or terrorist financing offences.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  THE NEPS services to pupil set out above are moderated through the school and delivered on school premises and during normal school opening period and so would not, save in the most exceptional of circumstances, be conducted during the summer school closure.</p>  <p>  Should any parent or guardian have concerns as to the educational, social or emotional development of their child they should, in the first instance, raise these concerns with the Principal of the school concerned with a view to his/her discussing the matter with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS office.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that NEPS psychologists provide direct advice and assistance to schools experiencing a critical incident or traumatic event and attend on-site at the school, when invited to do so by school authorities, throughout the year as events dictate, including during school closure periods.</p></reply>

It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>Where a school wish to appeal the SNA support allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at <i>www.ncse.ie.</i></p></reply>

In this regard, as I have said throughout, I am mindful of the need to avoid possible pitfalls and unintended consequences such as possible impacts on these minority religions and on the wishes of Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and other communities to be able to run schools in accordance with their ethos and admit children from their communities to attend those schools.</p>  <p>  The 8 week phase of receiving written submissions formed part of a broader consultation process.  I advised that following the receipt and analysis of written submissions, consideration would be given as to whether any additional steps are needed as part of the consultation process.  Accordingly, on Monday 15 May I announced that I will hold a Forum on the role of Religion in Primary School Admissions on Monday 29th May 2017.</p>  <p>  My aim is to find a solution which addresses the issues in this area, while respecting the strongly-held and legitimate desire of minority religious groups to run schools which are genuinely of their own ethos.</p></reply>

Section 23 (4) of the Act states that the Principal of a recognised school shall, before registering a child as a student at that school, provide the parents of such child with a copy of the school&rsquo;s code of behaviour.</p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist, from their NCSE Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), or from the National Behavioural Support Services, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>Many schools withdraw pupils occasionally from the main classroom for short periods of time in order to provide support to them, or to manage pupil behaviour, if a child is exhibiting behaviours which may be a danger to themselves or others.</p><p>In some circumstances, a child who is exhibiting extreme behaviours may be brought to another room to ensure the safety of other pupils and until they are calm again.  Schools should supervise and support children who leave the classroom until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom.</p><p>Where used, it will normally form part of a school&rsquo;s response to behaviour and part of student support structures, procedures and practices.</p><p>The withdrawal of a child from the classroom in order to deal individually with the child does not require the authorisation of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a matter for the school authorities, the child and the parents or guardians of the child concerned.</p><p>Some schools also have multi-sensory rooms that provide a variety of sensory stimuli and which are designed to provide sensory stimulation for pupils with special educational needs, in spaces which are designed to encourage positive actions and responses for pupils with sensory impairment.  They can also be used for pupils to use interactive equipment towards specific educational aims.</p><p>My Department, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS), provides continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers working with students with special educational needs, including training for teachers in the area of challenging behaviour and Autism.  My Department is also currently examining the issue of developing guidelines for schools on the specific issue of restraint or intervention.</p><p>Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.</p><p>Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla or to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with the Department's procedures.</p><p>The NCSE has published updated policy advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  In developing this policy advice, the NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.</p><p>The report includes 11 key Recommendations which focus on improvements which might be considered to the range of provisions which are currently available for children with Autism in schools.  The report includes recommendations in relation to Crisis Situations.  The report is available on the NCSE website .</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared.  The work of the Implementation Group is ongoing.</p><p>My Department is aware of some complaints and general queries concerning the use of quiet or withdrawal facilities in certain schools.  When such issues are raised with officials of my Department the complainants are referred in the first instance to the school principal or the school's Board of Management.</p></reply>

In restoring capitation payments, where schools have introduced these cost effective principles, they will receive a premium capitation payment.</p><p>I believe that full transparency in relation to the use of any voluntary contributions is important information for parents to have.  The Parent and Student Charter will require every school to set out a financial statement, which will include information on how any voluntary contributions are used.</p><p>This is part of a suite of measures I am introducing, including the School Admissions Bill which will reform information and procedures around the process of school enrolment, and the commencement of Fitness to Teach, which allow a complaint to be made about a registered teacher to the Teaching to Council for the first time.</p><p>Circular letter 32/2017 &lsquo;Measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs&rsquo; was published at the end of April and is available on my Departments website.</p><p>Following the implementation of the circular, school authorities will be required to adopt the following principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs:</p><p>- All elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores;</p><p>- Only iron on or sew on crests should be used;</p><p>- Wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.);</p><p>- Provide parents with a list of all required items and indicate the likely costs of these required items at best value stores;</p><p>- Provide a book rental scheme;</p><p>- Phase out, between now and September 2018, the use of workbooks which cannot be reused;</p><p>- Where an exclusive supply arrangement applies, it should be tendered for regularly and</p><p>- The Board of Management in each school will have to review the cost of items which they require parents to purchase and to make this information available to the school community.</p><p>Schools will consult with parents on their views and ask for suggestions on cost reduction initiatives.  Parents will be asked for their views about school uniform costs, and other costs, through a questionnaire.</p><p>The Circular does recognise that schools may already have made arrangements for the coming school year.  Where this is the position, Schools should implement this Circular from September 2017 onwards.</p><p>For example, in relation to school uniforms, schools may already have made arrangements for September 2017.  These schools can begin to engage with parents regarding the school uniform policy and other costs for September 2018.  It is anticipated that this engagement could begin from September 2017.  In relation to when schools will adopt the principles of cost-effective practice, my Department has not gathered information on the number of schools who intend to adopt the principles immediately and those schools who have already made arrangements for the coming school year and therefore intend to adopt the principles from September 2017 onwards.</p><p>When budgetary resources are available to provide a premium capitation payment for schools, the Department will then consider the most appropriate mechanism to gather evidence on whether or not schools have adopted the principles of cost-effective practice.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.</p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.</p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.</p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way.</p></reply>

It is intended that the 2016 Bill will be enacted before the Oireachtas Summer recess, at which time I will be able to commence the section 28(2) provisions.  </p>  <p>  As well as applying to permissions where the extended duration expires on or after the coming into force of section 28(2), the provisions also apply to qualifying development where the extended duration of the permission expired, or will expire, between 19 July 2016 (the date of publication of the Government's Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland) and the day preceding the commencement of section 28(2). </p>  <p>  Section 28(2) was enacted to deal with issues relating to housing developments, where substantial works were carried out before the expiry of the original duration of the permission but where work was not completed during the extended duration of the permission.  </p>  <p>  I am open to considering a further time-limited amendment of section 28(2) that could possibly apply to relevant housing developments where the development to which the permission relates was commenced before the expiry of the period sought to be extended, where substantial works were carried out in that period, and where the development will be completed within a reasonable time.  If details of developments that could qualify for a second extension of permission duration under an amendment along these lines could be shared with my Department, I will examine the matter further in the context of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 currently being progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The average time to process a paper claim is 6 weeks.  Processing claims by leave commencement date order ensures that those whose maternity leave has already started, or is due to start soon, receive priority.  Once a decision is made and the claim has been awarded, and where the leave has already commenced, payment issues on the following Monday and this payment will also include any arrears due to the customer at that point. </p>  <p>  I accept that there is a delay in the processing of maternity benefit claims and my Department is working hard to bring the position up to date.  To alleviate delays, additional staff have been assigned and staff are working overtime.  Further additional staff have been assigned this week and will commence processing claims immediately.  I want to assure customers that every effort is being made to ensure all claims are processed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Department also facilitates online applications for maternity benefit and an automated decision is made where the customer submits all necessary information and where the detail provided can be validated.  I would ask the Deputy to encourage women who are planning maternity leave to use this channel, if possible, as it provides the most effective method of applying for maternity benefit. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p>  <p>  These bands have been changed a number of times over the years.  For example, there was no payment for people with a yearly average below 24 until 1973, or for those below 20 until 1989.  Between the years 2000-2012, someone reaching retirement age with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  This meant that the last 20 years of a person&rsquo;s contributions to the Social Insurance Fund might have no impact upon their contributory pension entitlements.</p>  <p>  When savings were required in 2012, as part of dealing with the fiscal crisis which faced the country, it was decided to make them by addressing this anomaly, rather than cut the core rate of the pension, which would have hit all pensioners, including the poorest, notably those solely dependent upon the State pension.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the percentage rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;60 million in 2018, if introduced from January 2018, and that this annual cost would rise at a rate of some &euro;10 million each year, that is an additional amount of &euro;10 million in each subsequent year would be added to the base amount, e.g. &euro;70 million in 2019, etc.</p>  <p>  Calculation of the cost of backdating such a change (i.e. paying a lump sum in respect of the difference between such higher rates and those legislated for in the period 2012-2017) would be very complex, would require analysis of a number of historic datasets, and would be complicated by the fact that the State pension (transition) was abolished during the period in question.  There would also be issues as to whether such back-dating applied only in respect of such pensioners who were still in payment at the date a decision was made to backdate such a change, or if there would also be similar payments made to the estates and/or surviving spouses of those pensioners who died beforehand.  The effective date of such backdating would also impact upon the cost.  It is very tentatively estimated that, depending on the details of such a payment, the cost of such backdating would be in the region of &euro;200 million.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that backdating of such an increase and payment as a lump sum would be extremely unusual, in the context of a weekly payment such as the State pension, and there are no plans to make such a payment.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Indeed there is no such facility for recipients of the Contributory State Pension.  However, the interests and concerns of public service pensioners in relation to public service pension issues have been regularly articulated in meetings between the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and my Department.  This engagement has also included meetings between the Alliance, myself and my predecessor.  Through that process of engagement with the Alliance, I believe that public service pensioners have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns in relation to pensions and related issues.</p>  <p>  The period since the Alliance&rsquo;s engagement with my Department commenced in 2013 has been marked by notable legislated pension improvements for many public service pensioners.  Specifically, public service pensioners are benefitting significantly from the substantial reversal of the cuts to public service pensions above specified thresholds which were originally imposed by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) under the FEMPI legislation.</p>  <p>  I and my Department are fully committed to maintaining the well-established dialogue with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants.  Through ongoing recourse to that dialogue process, I believe that retired public servants and their representatives can be confident that their pension concerns will receive full and proper consideration as they have done in the past.</p></reply>

The initial focus of the Creative Ireland programme this year is to undertake to develop an industry-wide, long-term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation by the end of 2017.  This objective is also reflected in the Action Plan for Rural Ireland given the importance of the film industry to rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department has commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries, in partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector.  Following an open tender process, Olsberg SPI Ltd in association with Nordicity, was selected to conduct the study in November last year.  The commissioning of the study was also a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the economic study will inform the development of the plan envisaged under the Creative Ireland Programme and Action Plan for Rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 5 May last, I hosted a very successful Media Production Workshop at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which attracted attendance by representatives of the film, broadcast, animation and gaming industries.  The outcomes of this event will also input into the consultants study and the proposed Government plan.  It is intended that the economic study will be completed this Summer and that the Government plan based on the study will be published in the early Autumn.</p></reply>

The central objective of the REDZ concept is to use the synergies and interdependencies between rural towns and their outlying areas to generate local economic activity.</p>  <p>  A pilot REDZ initiative was launched in 2015 and, based on that pilot, I launched a further phase of the initiative in 2016.  Following a competitive process, I approved total funding of &euro;6.142 million in 2016 for 47 REDZ projects across the country.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Action Plan for Rural Development, I intend to conduct a review of the REDZ initiative this year.  I anticipate that the review will commence in Quarter 3 and that it will be finalised by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, based on initial feedback from the 2015 REDZ pilot, I am welcoming, under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme which I launched in April, applications that demonstrate a REDZ-type component, to stimulate economic activity between towns/villages and their outlying areas.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the legislation will establish a mechanism for transfer of parentage from the surrogate (and her husband, if she has one) to the intending parents. </p>  <p>  In addition, it is envisaged that under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child.  Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed, however, commercial surrogacy will be prohibited.</p>  <p>  The intention of the legislation in this area is to protect, promote and ensure the health and safety of surrogate mothers, others involved in the process (such as donors and parents) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website . </p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. </p><p>All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:</p><p>1.  There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;</p><p>2.  There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and</p><p>3.  Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.</p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  </p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. </p><p>The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.  Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  </p><p>There is extensive information for the public and health professionals on the HPSC website.  This information for the public includes: </p><p>-  Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions;</p><p>-  Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; </p><p>-  Lyme Disease Illustrations; and</p><p>-  CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.</p><p>There is significant support and information for health professionals on the HPSC website.  These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyne Disease.  This fact sheet gives information on clinical  the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment.  There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. </p><p>With regard to medical education and training, the content and composition of curricula and specialist training programmes is a matter for the Medical Council and the recognised medical education or postgraduate training bodies.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act, all medical degree courses and specialist training programmes in Ireland are required to be accredited by the Council.  As of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care.</p><p>As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access these services.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>-  Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>-  Bed and board;</p><p>-  Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>-  Laundry service.</p><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>-  Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>-  Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>-  Local market price; and</p><p>-  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>-  Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>-  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>-  Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is well advanced. </p><p>The NTPF has no role in relation to the cost of care in public residential facilities.  Section 33(2) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for the HSE to charge for the cost of care in long-term residential care settings.  The components that make up the cost of care are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

It sets out a range of extraordinary special measures which can be activated throughout the escalation process as a last resort.</p>  <p>  These measures aim to improve the flow of admitted patients through unscheduled care pathways.  As part of this a Medical Assessment Unit may temporarily be used to accommodate a locally agreed number of extra patients to address the overcrowding.  This is often referred to as being used for surge capacity.  At these times, patients are seen in the Emergency Department rather than in the Medical Assessment Unit (MAU).  While this temporary change of use may not be ideal in terms of the utilisation of these units, it does enable hospitals to alleviate overcrowding in EDs and afford patients a greater degree of dignity.</p>  <p>  Recent data from the HSE indicates that despite an increase in over 3% in attendances for the first quarter in 2017, the situation at the Our Lady of Lourdes ED has been improving, with 42% fewer patients waiting a trolley, as compared to the same period last year.  This equates to 850 fewer patients on trolleys this year so far.  This ED has also seen a sustained improvement in Patient Experience Times during this period.</p>  <p>  I have been advised that the management and use of the Medical Assessment Unit facility in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital continues to adhere to standard operating procedures as set out in the HSE Full Capacity Protocol.</p>  <p>  In relation to increasing capacity at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, construction of a new ward block, including Clinical Decision Unit is ongoing.

The NTPF has advised that the Initiative has commenced and patients are currently receiving their appointments.  Specifically, over 350 patients awaiting cataract procedures who would have been waiting for longer than 18 months by the end of June have been identified as appropriate to test the first clinical pathway for this outsourcing initiative. </p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.</p>  <p>  These plans have now been finalised and will be communicated shortly.</p></reply>

In this context, Section 3 of the Act makes provision for Ministerial Policy Directives to issue to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats.  I am, however, precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to individual cases, or a group of cases, with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned under Section 3(5) of the 2003 Act.</p>  <p>  I received proposals from a Producer Organisation which, in summary, relate to the possibility of reducing the requirement to provide 100% replacement capacity with the relevant track record to 80% (the balance being sourced from capacity without track record).  I undertook a public consultation process on these proposals and made a consultation paper available which set out the background to fleet policy and carried out an analysis of the current situation.  The consultation paper examined the implications of the proposals made by the Producer Organisation and also put forward alternative options.  This consultation ended on 28 February 2017.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, 26 submissions were received in this regard and they are currently being examined.  To support transparency in this process, I can inform the Deputy that all views received on the Consultation Document are now publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This scheme was offered by the EU Commission to Member States to implement on a voluntary basis to allow producers who had incurred super levy debt to spread the cost over three years (2015&ndash;2017) interest free.  This repayment schedule took the form of a 33% lump sum in 2015 and the balance to be spread over five equal instalments in 2016 and 2017 over the peak production period of May to September.  Ireland was one the few MS with a super levy bill to introduce the scheme.</p>  <p>  At the end of the milk quota regime in April 2015 Ireland exceeded its quota by 4.4%, resulting in a super levy bill of &euro;71 million for 6,400 Irish farmers.  Each Member State was obliged to settle the liability in full in 2015 with the EU Commission and could then re-coup the money from its farmers as per the scheme.  My Department chose to implement the scheme on the basis that it would minimise the burden on the sector during a period of planned expansion here as well as helping with the immediate cash flow difficulties for farmers faced with such a bill.</p>  <p>  In 2015 2,700 producers opted to pay their full levy (&euro;16.7 million) to my Department up front with &euro;18.9m collected from the remaining 3,700 producers by 1 October 2015.  These 3,700 producers are the participants in the instalment scheme and 2015 was the first year of their three-year repayment phase.  My Department introduced the scheme of phased recoupment from farmers who had the option of joining the scheme and spreading their repayment over three years. </p>  <p>  This scheme was financed from Exchequer funds and so my Department is responsible for ensuring that the funds advanced to the Commission on behalf of farmers are recouped on behalf of the taxpayer.  The person in question incurred a superlevy fine because they supplied almost double their assigned quota in the 2014/15 quota year.</p>  <p>  In any event, given that the milk quota regime ended on 31 March 2015 and all superlevy liabilities due to the EU Commission were paid by Ireland on 1 November 2015, it is not possible at this stage to have any super levy liabilities recalculated for individual producers.  There is no mechanism within the relevant EU Regulations implementing the scheme to cancel any of the liabilities.</p></reply>

While Teagasc must remain within its overall pay budget, the flexibility provided by the new arrangements allows them to fill critical vacancies and to react faster when such vacancies arise in the future.

This compares with an EU average of 1.4kg/kg.  The report also stated that Ireland had the lowest emissions per kg of pork (4.8 kg/kg) with the EU average 7.5kg/kg and Ireland&rsquo;s emissions per kg of beef were 18.4 kg/kg with and EU Average of 22.2kg/kg.</p>  <p>  The Report also recognised that with regard to dairy systems in Europe, intensive systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, but this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change.  Lowest emissions are created by extensive grassland systems, such as those in Ireland.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production system.</p>  <p>  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland's green house gas (GHG) emissions.  It is the most significant GHG emitted from agricultural activity in Ireland accounting for 64.5% of total agricultural emissions.  Enteric fermentation, which is a natural process in the digestive system of ruminant animals that results in the emission of methane, accounts for 90% of agricultural methane emissions.  The remaining agricultural methane is associated with the storage and management of animal manures.</p>  <p>  Current research into reducing methane emissions is primarily focussed on reducing emissions per unit product (i.e. reducing emissions intensity).  This research is primarily focused on improving productivity per animal and thus decoupling animal numbers from production.  Most of this research is focussed on developing economic breeding indices (EBI), extension of the grazing season, reducing beef finishing times (and reducing total methane per animal) and optimising beef and dairy animals via the use of sexed semen.  Many of these measures are currently in use or being commenced.</p>  <p>  Carbon audits by our Food Agency (An Bord Bia) are placing new emphasis on reduction in emissions intensity of beef and dairy produce.</p>  <p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland can take the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, in the Irish agriculture sector.  In the Rural Development Programme, there are some 38,000 farmers taking part in the Green Low carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) and 24,000 herds in the first Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP), which is a world-leading initiative to improve the quality of breeding of our beef cattle.  Applications for participating in a new BDGP are currently being processed.</p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 is a cohesive, strategic plan for the sustainable development of agrifood sector over the next decade.  The strategy identified over 400 recommendations to achieve the growth projections identified at the outset which the Agrifood Strategy Committee believed were achievable.  Progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis by a High Level Implementation Committee.  The first progress report Steps to Success outlined that good progress had been made in its first year.  A second annual progress report is due to be produced shortly.</p></reply>

For reasons of client confidentiality, the Agency cannot make details of specific visits publicly available. </p>  <p>  It is important to remember that the number of site visits to a particular county is not necessarily an accurate measure of the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) activity in the area.  That is because approximately 70% of all FDI won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies.</p>  <p>  Although I am satisfied with the IDA's record results over the last number of years, both the Agency and I continue to work hard to increase the level of FDI in Ireland, especially in areas outside Dublin.  Regional development remains a top priority and we are focused on continuing the good progress made in growing employment outside of our main urban areas.  Last year, for example, over half of all jobs created by IDA Ireland's clients were based outside of Dublin.  This includes 186 new jobs created in Kerry in 2016.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process. </p>  <p>  In this regard, Budget 2017 secured a capital spending allocation of &euro;74 million, representing an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 Defence allocation contained in the 2016-21 capital investment programme.  This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper. </p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for force protection. </p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft has commenced with the recent publication of the Request for Tenders on the Etenders website and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in accordance with national and EU procurement regulations. </p>  <p>  The two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.  The CASAs will be replaced with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and to provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. </p>  <p>  With regard to training aircraft, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft, scheduled for delivery this year from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland will bring the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps. </p>  <p>  The current Naval Service Ship replacement programme has already seen the replacement of three Naval Service vessels.  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  An agreement was reached in June 2016 for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built to the same specifications as the three newest vessels.  This ship is scheduled for delivery next year.  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government and to meet and deal with the needs from modern challenges.</p></reply>

My Department, on an ongoing basis also reviews in consultation with the military authorities, existing deployments and also other UN mandated missions.  Following recent government approval, the number of Irish personnel deployed to EUTM Mali will increase from 18 to 20 personnel in the near future.

Leadership training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations.  Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.  Career training and education provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels.  Collective training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces. </p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms against best military and academic practice.  Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/ Partnership for Peace partners.  Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces delivers military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards.  The Defence Forces also engages with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.  This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retains currency with regards to best international practice and employs all relevant modern training methods.  I am committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to best international standards.</p></reply>

As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise.  I am advised by the Military Authorities that a total of 590 General Service Recruits were enlisted into the Permanent Defence Force in 2016, of which 501 Recruits were enlisted in the Army and 89 Recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service.
