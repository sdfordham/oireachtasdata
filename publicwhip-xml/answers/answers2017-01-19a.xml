The provisions in the 2015 Act were developed subsequently, informed by their analysis.  However, a lot has changed in the rental market since the scheme was first envisaged.  The scheme was originally intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable in the current market.  Furthermore, disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB.  In 2015, deposit retention at 22% was the third most common dispute type referred to the Board, behind invalid notice of termination at 23% and rent arrears and over-holding at 32%.</p><p>While the Government is fully committed to the principle of ensuring effective protection of deposits, it is now proposed that the current legislative provisions be reviewed to take account of the changed circumstances and determine what improvements should be made to ensure that the scheme, when introduced, can operate effectively.</p><p>The development of the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>was supported by a stakeholder consultation workshop and an online consultation process which received close to 500 submissions.  Many stakeholders, including landlords, contributed to both processes and their views were taken into account in the formulation of the actions in the Strategy. </p><p>The review of the scheme will take place this year with any necessary legislative changes to be included in the general scheme of a Residential Tenancies Bill which, under the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, is to be brought forward by end 2017.</p></reply>

This figure represents an increase of 1,728 households, or 1.9%, on the 89,872 households recorded in the last summary which was carried out in May 2013.  The results of the 2016 Summary are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness,</i>published in July 2016, sets out the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the current challenges in the housing sector.  Delivering on the ambitious targets set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland,</i>including the commitment to deliver an additional 47,000 social housing units by 2021 and an accelerated roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment over the same period, will address the needs of households on waiting lists.  The 2016 Summary results will be used this year to inform the setting by my Department of social housing targets on a county by county basis for the period covered by the Action Plan.</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>also aims to address the unacceptable level of homeless families and persons in long-term emergency accommodation through the implementation of a range of measures, including the rapid-delivery housing programme.</p><p>It is important to note that rapid delivery housing needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of solutions to address the high number of families currently being housed in emergency accommodation.  These include the Housing Agency Programme to acquire 1,600 vacant units and the expanded HAP Homeless Pilot Scheme in Dublin, under which the target of 550 tenancies for 2016 was exceeded and a further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the greater Dublin region.  While confirmed details are awaited from local authorities, it can be expected that at least 2,700 exits from homelessness will be achieved nationally in 2016, compared with 2,322 in 2015.</p></reply>

As HAP is rolled out nationally and replaces Rent Supplement for households with a long- term housing need, the number of households transferring to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) will decrease.  In the meantime, RAS continues to be an effective and secure form of social housing support that local authorities have been utilising in order to secure additional social housing.</p>  <p>  In relation to HAP, at the end of 2015, seven households were being supported by HAP in the Galway County administrative area at a total cost of &euro;548 in that year.  At the end of 2016, an additional 381 households were supported by HAP in the administrative area of Galway County Council, with a provisional cost of &euro;734,177 for the full year.</p>  <p>  336 households were supported by HAP in the administrative area of Galway City Council at a provisional cost of &euro;650,542 at the end of 2016, which was the first year of the scheme&rsquo;s operation in the city.</p>  <p>  In relation to RAS, at the end of 2015, 420 households were supported by RAS in Galway City with a further 391 households supported in the Galway County area.  To end November 2016, a further 48 households had been transferred to RAS in Galway City and 21 new transfers to RAS in Galway County during 2016.  The final number of households supported in 2016 in these two local authorities is being collated and will be provided on my Department&rsquo;s website along with the figures for all other local authorities once available.</p>  <p>  The cost of RAS in Galway City was &euro;3.8m and &euro;3.6m in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  The cost of RAS in Galway County was &euro;2.15m and &euro;2.03m in 2015 and 2016, respectively.</p>  <p>  Details on the number of persons in each household supported by any of social housing schemes funded by my Department are not held by my Department; these would be a matter for the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  Information relating to the cost of, and tenancies supported by, Rent Supplement is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019, in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the preceding year (i.e. 2018 ) and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year. </p>  <p>  The timeframes set out in the legislation in relation to the commencement of the application of the levy are based on legal advice in relation to the constitutional rights of property owners and are intended to allow site owners sufficient time and opportunity to initiate development on their sites, or alternatively to sell their sites, in order to avoid becoming liable for the levy.</p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.05 hectares (or 500 square metres) in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.</p>  <p>  I have no proposals to amend the existing legislative provisions relating to the vacant site levy in relation to the timeframes for implementation or the rate of the levy to be applied as proposed.   </p>  <p>  My Department issued general guidance to planning authorities in July 2016 on the implementation of the vacant site levy.  I understand that planning authorities are engaging in the necessary preparatory work, including the variation of development plans and the identification of specific vacant sites for entry on the register.  My Department will monitor the implementation of the levy provisions to ensure that it is being fully used in line with its intended purpose.</p></reply>

The programme was developed on the basis of priority proposals submitted by local authorities and will invest &euro;22m in 16 or so projects as well as 23 pilot sites for My Open Libraries over its lifetime.

In accordance with section 37(2) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services, including the provision of good quality accommodation, rests with individual housing authorities.  The matter raised in the Question is an operational issue in the day-to-day delivery of services and is therefore a matter for individual housing authorities in the first instance, working in conjunction with the range of homeless services providers engaged in the provision and management of emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department understands that enhanced National Quality Standards for Homeless Services are currently being developed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive on behalf of all local authorities.  A national advisory group has been in place since 2014 with representation from non-governmental homelessness service providers, the Health Service Executive, Tusla, etc. as well as the housing authorities.  Draft standards were piloted in services in four of the nine homeless regions during 2016 and it is expected that they will be implemented nationally in the first half of this year.</p></reply>

The Plan is available at the website <i>www.rebuildingireland.ie.</i>The Plan is divided into five pillars, with each targeting a specific area of the housing system for attention.</p><p>On 13 December 2016 , Government approved the publication of a <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, which delivers on a commitment made under Pillar 4 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.  The strategy is structured around 4 key areas: security, standards, supply and services.  The measures under these four headings will be implemented through the 29 actions contained in the Strategy.</p><p>In terms of supply, the focus in the strategy is on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  The overarching objective of the strategy is to increase supply and support the development of a stable, strong and viable rental sector offering true choice for households, investment opportunities for providers and reflecting the rights and responsibilities of tenants and landlords. </p><p>There are shortages in the supply of rental accommodation in key locations, particularly in urban areas.  In some of these areas there is also significant demand for transitory short-term accommodation.  In this context easier access to short term rentals at higher prices may be an attractive option for landlords.</p><p>However, a recent determination by An Bord Pleanala in a particular case has determined that the exclusive use of a residential apartment for short-term holiday lettings is a material change of use requiring planning permission. </p><p>My Department has, by way of Circular letter PL12/2016 of 22 December 2016, brought this determination to the attention of all planning authorities to ensure that they are aware of:</p><p>- the grounds on which the Board reached its decision,</p><p>- the planning implications in terms of the requirement for such commercial use of residential units to be the subject of an application for planning permission, and</p><p>- the importance of a proactive approach to planning enforcement generally in this regard. </p><p>The implications of this case have raised a number of regulatory and other related issues, such as tax liability, residential tenancy regulation, support for tourism, and planning.  With a view to providing full clarity regarding the appropriate regulatory approach to be adopted by relevant statutory authorities in relation to short-term tourism-related lettings, and as provided for in the recently published <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, my Department is establishing a working group, comprising representatives of relevant stakeholders including local authorities, relevant Departments, public bodies and other interests in the area, to consider the disparate issues involved and report in Quarter 2 2017.</p></reply>

At the end of 2016, a total of 350 rapid build homes were advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, with 22 rapid build homes being delivered and occupied in 2016.  A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018. </p>  <p>  In terms of specific progress at the end of 2016, Dublin City Council were advancing a number of rapid build projects, including on four sites at Finglas, Darndale, Cherry Orchard and Drimnagh, which are under construction and will deliver a further 131 homes over the coming months.  My Department is working closely with the Council to expedite delivery.</p>  <p>  In addition to these four projects, further work across the four local authorities has resulted in the 350 rapid build homes, referred to above, advancing through various stages of delivery by the end of the 2016.  The additional sites in question are in Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire, Cherry Orchard, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Balbriggan.  Construction dates will be finalised in the context of completion of procurement and award of contracts.  In addition, sites are being identified and planning requirements advanced for a further 650 rapid build homes in 2017, across the 4 Dublin local authority areas and other local authority areas across the country.  This will ensure that the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland to deliver 1,000 rapid build homes over 2016 and 2017 is met.  It is important to note that the units being delivered are permanent, high quality homes, with 60 year life guarantees.</p>  <p>  There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively.  However, there are requirements, such as in relation to procurement, that must be adhered to and in some instances this has caused delays.  Notwithstanding this, I am confident that all parties are endeavouring to move the programme forward speedily.  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that rapid delivery needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation.  These include the Housing Agency Programme to acquire 1,600 vacant units and the expanded HAP Homeless Pilot Scheme in Dublin, where some 800 homeless HAP tenancies were entered into and a further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the greater Dublin region.  Overall, the significant programme of actions underway has resulted in an estimated 2,700 exits from homelessness being achieved nationally in 2016, a significant increase on the comparable figure of 2,322 in 2015.</p></reply>

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income, such as Family Income Supplement (FIS), for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority in accordance with their own rent scheme.  Consequently, I have not had any discussions to date with the Minister for Social Protection on the matter.</p><p>Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme, including the sources of household income that may be assessed for the purpose of determining rent levels.  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  This includes providing for a common set of income disregards to be applied by all housing authorities in determining a household&rsquo;s assessable income for rent calculation purposes.  These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market. </p><p>As part of this review process, which I expect to be completed before the end of Quarter 2 2017, my Department will directly engage with key stakeholders, including other relevant Government Departments such as the Department of Social Protection, to seek their views on particular aspects of the current differential rents schemes in place across the country.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the commitment that, by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  Full details and timeframes in relation to the range of actions to address family homelessness are set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, which is available on the <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.rebuildingireland.ie website.</font></i></p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font></i>The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 201 6 will play an important role in the achievement of this overall objective, in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation.  However where families do find themselves in homelessness situations there are a range of solutions in place and bring progressed.  These include the Housing Agency programme to acquire 1,600 units and the expanded HAP Homeless Pilot Scheme in Dublin, where some 800 homeless HAP tenancies were entered into by end-2016 and a further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region.  A rapid-build programme is also in place, with over 350 rapid-build homes advancing at end-2016.  My Department engages with the Dublin region local authorities on a regular and on-going basis in relation to the delivery of these initiatives.</p><p>Overall, it is important to note that the significant programme of actions underway has resulted in an estimated 2,700 exits from homelessness being achieved nationally in 2016, a significant increase on the comparable figure of 2,322 in 2015.  </p></reply>

My Open Library seeks to enhance the library services available and to secure a flexible, responsive and ground-breaking service for as wide a range of users as possible.  To this end, the service allows library members the freedom to use the library at times that suit them.  It provides additional opening hours from 8am to 10pm, seven days-per-week, clearly enhancing the service for users and providing access for those who cannot avail of the library service during standard working hours.   </p>  <p>  I do not agree that My Open Library will precipitate a race to the bottom in terms of employment standards.  Neither do I accept that it represents a change of ethos within the library service.  As previously stated, there will be no reduction in staffing levels or staffed hours as a result of the service, nor will there be any change to the working terms and conditions of library staff.  A professional and skilled library staff is vital for a successful library service.  To this end, my Department is working with local authorities across a range of areas to enhance staffing resources, maximise staffed library hours and secure the highest possible service delivery for library users.</p></reply>

In accordance with section 37 (2) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services, including accommodation, rests with individual housing authorities and, in accordance with sections 38 and 39 of the Act, a Homelessness Consultative Forum and Statutory Management Group, which include representatives of the Health Service Executive, advise and assist housing authorities, inter alia, in the configuration and provision of homeless services in their areas.</p><p>I am aware of the difficulties faced by those recovering from addiction in emergency accommodation and I am informed that, within the statutory structures mentioned above, the HSE is actively involved in providing appropriate in-reach services to assist such individuals with their addiction, mental health and other health needs.  Also, where appropriate to the individuals&rsquo; needs, I understand that the service providers in emergency accommodation will try to ensure recovering addicts are placed in single rooms to assist them in their recovery.</p><p>As the Deputy would be aware, responsibility for policy development in relation to addiction and rehabilitation issues rests with the Minister for Health and the delivery of services in this regard is managed through the Health Service Executive.  Under <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>, the Department of Health and the HSE are committed to addressing the rehabilitation needs of homeless people with addiction issues through the forthcoming new National Drugs Strategy, which will have a particular emphasis on projects providing drug and alcohol detoxification programmes and enduring services supporting long-term recovery.</p><p>Furthermore under <i>Rebuilding Ireland,</i>the target for delivering secure tenancies for the most-vulnerable homeless individuals under the Dublin Region &lsquo;housing-first&rsquo; initiative has been tripled from 100 to 300.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p><p>The Acts provide that rents may not be greater than the open market rate and generally may only be reviewed upward or downward every 24 months unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice of new rent and may make an application for dispute resolution to the RTB where they feel the rent increase is in excess of the market rent.  These provisions have effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a lease or tenancy agreement.</p><p>On 13 December, Government approved the publication of a <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, which delivers on a commitment made under the <i>Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>which was published in July 2016. </p><p>One of the measures contained in the Strategy is the introduction of a Rent Predictability Measure.  This is a new provision that will moderate the rise in rents in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising.In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones, rents will only be able to rise by a maximum of 4% annually.  This measure has been applied immediately to Dublin and Cork city because they already meet the criteria for a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced the Rent Predictability Measure with effect from 24 December 2016.  If a valid notice of new rent was served on a tenant before the legislation was enacted, or a valid rent review commenced before that date, then the rent pressure zone formula does not apply.</p><p>However, a rent review cannot take place until 24 months has elapsed since either the commencement of the tenancy or since the last rent review under the tenancy and the rent set may not be greater than the open market rate.  Where the tenant feels that these conditions have not been fulfilled, they may initiate a dispute resolution procedure with the RTB.</p><p>A notice of new rent must be in writing and must be accompanied by information in relation to the rents of 3 other similar dwellings in the area.

The strategy sets out a range of measures under the headings of Security, Supply, Standards and Services to address both immediate and long term issues affecting the supply, cost, accessibility and quality of rental accommodation.</p><p>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>The findings and recommendations of the National Oversight and Audit Commission&rsquo;s (NOAC) report, <i>Rented Houses Inspections - A Review of Local Authority Performance of Private Rented Houses Regulations Functions</i>were carefully considered in the context of the development of the Strategy.</p><p>A review of the standards regulations to bring them into line with modern requirements has been completed and changes to the regulations, focussing on tenant safety and including new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety, will be published shortly and will take effect from 1 July 2017.  New guidelines to address the findings of the NOAC report and ensure a uniform approach to inspections and enforcement both within and across local authorities will be issued in Q2 2017.</p><p>Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards in order to increase the numbers of properties inspected and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities.  The objective is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year with the aim of achieving a 25% annual inspection coverage rate by 2021.</p><p>As outlined in the Strategy, in order to support landlords and improve standards in the rental sector, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) will offer a voluntary landlord accreditation scheme by which landlords and agents will gain knowledge on best practice, including a comprehensive understanding of the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.  Such accreditation will be voluntary and offered as a service by the RTB, rather than mandatory regulation.  The accreditation will show tenants that landlords are professional and offering a quality service and allow landlords to be recognised for the good service being provided.  It will also support landlords in their rental business, providing confidence in applying and adhering to the regulatory framework.  The potential for accreditation courses and Continuous Professional Development or refresher courses for all registered landlords will also be explored.</p><p>The Strategy can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland website at:</p></reply>

Any relevant data compilation and management in relation to those clients is a matter for Tusla and the Department of Social Protection respectively.

While I am not in a position to commit to a target date for the publication of each month&rsquo;s data, I will continue to ensure that the data are published in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of the need to collect the housing authority reports, liaise with the housing authorities on any data quality issues and compile the data into a formal publication, without impacting negatively on the overall quality of the data.  </p></reply>

Activity by institutional and professional residential sector investment specialists such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) in purchasing housing and engaging in the building out of part completed schemes and commencing new housing projects is a positive signal of investment beginning to flow back into the housing sector to provide the housing that people need.</p>  <p>  The acquisition and management of properties by professional Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) is one component part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.  Investments by REITs that increase the number of dwellings available in the rented sector are a positive development.  That said, a diverse sector, which includes both institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects and small scale and individual landlords, is inherently more stable and less exposed to property market risk and volatility.</p>  <p>  Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Attracting large scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.   </p>  <p>  In cases where buy-to-let mortgages are sold on by the original lender, the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and tenant and the terms of the mortgage are unaffected.</p></reply>

For example, phone calls outside of office hours or to stations that are not manned at the time of the call are redirected to the local District Headquarter station and answered.  In cases of non-urgent incidents, it is also possible to email all stations using the Garda website.  Emails are responded to at District Headquarters during office hours and forwarded to the relevant Garda station.  In situations of emergency members of the public can, of course, contact the emergency services using the 999/112 facility.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are, I understand, kept under regular review.</p></reply>

Refugees have been resettled in 39 different communities throughout Ireland and in all four Dublin local authority areas to date.</p>  <p>  The key elements of the programme are:</p>  <p>  - The programme is overseen at the national level by an Inter-Departmental Working Group chaired by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) in the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  - It is overseen at the local level by an inter-agency working group established in each receiving community and chaired by the Local Authority.</p>  <p>  - Representatives of the OPMI resettlement team, accompanied by interpreters, meet the refugees on arrival airside in the airport and accompany them to an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately 8 to 10 weeks.</p>  <p>  - An 8 to 10 week language training and orientation programme is provided by the Education and Training Board in cooperation with OPMI at the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre.  Speakers are invited from various organisations to provide information about their services to the refugees.  Interpretation is provided to ensure a full understanding of the content on the part of the refugees.</p>  <p>  - Childcare is provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the programme.</p>  <p>  - Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  - Refugees are assisted to apply for medical cards and assigned a GP.</p>  <p>  - Refugees are taken to register with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) where they are issued with a Registration Certificate and to the Department of Social Protection to register for a public services card and to be assessed for a social protection income.</p>  <p>  - Programme refugees have, in general, the same rights and entitlements as an Irish citizen in relation e.g. to employment, education and training, medical care, social welfare, access to the courts etc.  OPMI works in consultation with all relevant agencies at the national and local level to ensure that refugees can access services to which they are entitled and that the necessary services are put in place as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  - Prior to the transfer of refugees to their permanent location, decisions about housing, education, health services etc. have to be taken by the local inter-agency working group in consultation with OPMI.</p>  <p>  - The OPMI arranges the transfer from the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre to the receiving community.  OPMI staff also accompany refugees to their first appointments with the various public services in the local community, providing interpretation where required and assisting in the resolution of any difficulties etc.</p>  <p>  - Further language training is provided in the receiving community by the Education and Training Board for a period of 12 months post arrival.</p>  <p>  - The OPMI resettlement team supports the local inter-agency working group for approximately 18 months after the transfer of the refugees to the receiving community.  Grants are made by the OPMI to the receiving community to employ a resettlement support worker for a period of up to one year.  The Resettlement Support Worker organises a suite of integration initiatives during the first year post arrival, such as the establishment of homework clubs, developing links with sporting clubs; promoting participation in local men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s activities; organising intercultural events and promoting participation in the arts and in volunteering at a local level.  In the first year post resettlement, the focus is on preparing refugees for employment and independent living.  Language and other training programmes are organised at a local level by the Education and Training Board in consultation with INTREO and other local agencies.</p>  <p>  - All resettled refugees have the contact details of their key OPMI resettlement officer should any issues arise that cannot be resolved locally.</p>  <p>  Similar supports will be provided for all refugees admitted under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.</p></reply>

The programme is premised on the key requirement that applications are beneficial for Ireland, good for job creation, are in the public interest and that the funds invested are legally acquired and owned by the investor (i.e. not borrowed).  It is also essential that applicants be of good character. In return the investor applicant and their immediate family members are granted rights of residence in the State which will allow them to enter the State on multi-entry visas and to remain here for an initial period of 2 years, renewal for a further 3 years, subject to certain criteria being met (i.e. the investment has not been withdrawn, they continue to be law abiding and self sufficient). </p><p>All applications under the Immigrant Investor Programme are considered on their merits by an independent Interdepartmental Evaluation Committee who have the requisite skills and experience to evaluate the applications.  The membership comprises of officials from the IDA; Enterprise Ireland; Department of Finance; Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade; Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (which also provides the administrative assistance to the Committee).  </p><p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that a total of 130 applications have been approved, resulting in an Investment of approximately &euro;65 million at &euro;500,000 per investor.  A breakdown by year is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Applications Approved</th></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>65</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>23 (see below)</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the original level of investment required when the programme was introduced in 2012 was &euro;1 million.  This was reduced to &euro;500,000 to stimulate interest in the programme.  In total 450 IIP applications have been made since April 2012, with some 273 applications i.e. 40 % being submitted between July and November 2016.  This upsurge in applications was considered by the independent Evaluation Committee who recommended the restoration of the minimum investment threshold to its original level.  I approved this course of action having brought the matter to the attention of my Cabinet colleagues. </p><p>One notable trend associated with the surge in applications under the scheme has been the significant number of the applications received in the area of Primary Health Care Centres, nursing homes and social housing.  The evaluation committee considered that investment in these areas needed to be co-ordinated with the major state service providers responsible.  In that context, discussions have taken place, and will continue, with officials from the relevant Departments and where necessary other State agencies, to ensure that any possible investment options are appropriately aligned with the strategic priorities of the State's health and social housing strategies.  The apparent slowdown in applications approved in 2016 is explained by this need to consult with these stakeholders.  A final decision on some 306 applications (all made prior to the increase in the threshold), will be made in coming weeks. </p></reply>

The assessment of the threat is that while an attack on Ireland is possible, it is not considered likely.  Nor is there at present any specific information that an attack on Ireland is planned.  The level of threat from this source is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the light of ongoing developments and the current international situation.</p><p>  The Deputy will understand, of course, that the detail of such security measures should not be disclosed publicly.  What I can say is that the Garda Authorities will continue to take all necessary security measures proportionate to the level of terrorist threat and all the relevant agencies here co-operate closely in respect of any threats identified.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed considerable operational capacities in countering terrorism and in responding to critical incidents.  There is, in particular, a highly-trained and well-equipped special intervention capability in the Emergency Response Unit that is supported by the regional Armed Support Units and the range of other resources across the Garda organisation.  In addition, the considerable skills and resources of the Defence Forces are also available in support where needed.</p><p>There is a number of persons here whose activities in support of extremism give rise to concern and they will continue to be monitored closely by the Garda authorities and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard. </p><p>The Garda Authorities will continue to work closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to the shared threat of international terrorism.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this international co-operation.  The Government is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to enhance their connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources and significant work is ongoing in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen Information System and, indeed, to other EU and Interpol information-sharing resources relevant to countering the terrorist threat.</p><p>A series of measures is currently being rolled at EU-level out to build on the current EU framework for information-sharing, combating terrorism and controlling illegal firearms, and Ireland is fully engaged in pursuing these developments.</p><p>I should emphasise for the Deputy that the main security threat in the State is from republican paramilitary groups who reject the Good Friday Agreement and they continue to be a priority counter-terrorism focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda authorities will continue to target those involved and to work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in combating these groups.

It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship through naturalisation, if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions as prescribed in the Act.  The statutory conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be of full age,</p><p>- be of good character,</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p><p>- have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&mdash;</p><p>(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</p><p>(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p><p>Under Irish law it is possible for an Irish citizen to hold dual citizenship; the acquisition of Irish citizenship is not contingent on the renunciation of the citizenship of another jurisdiction.

Pending legal clarity on these issues, applications by prisoners abroad for transfer to Ireland cannot be processed to a conclusion at present.

The scheme is open to both those who are purchasing new builds from a developer, and those who self-build.  By restricting it to new builds and new self-build homes only, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.</p><p>Broadly, the relief takes the form of a rebate of income tax, including DIRT, paid over the previous four tax years.  The maximum possible rebate is 5% of the purchase price or valuation for a self-build up to a maximum of &euro;400,000.  Although relevant properties valued at up to &euro;500,000 can qualify, the maximum relief is capped at &euro;20,000 per property, subject to the applicant having paid sufficient income tax and DIRT over the previous 4 years.  Where more than one individual is involved in purchasing or building a new home, all of the individuals must be first-time buyers.</p><p>There are additional conditions of the scheme that must be met, including that the property must have been purchased or built as the first-time buyer's principal private residence, and that the mortgage taken out to purchase or build the home must be a minimum of 70% of the purchase price or 70% of the value of the property in the case of a self-build.</p><p>Applications for the Help to Buy incentive can be made to the Revenue Commissioners.

The Action Plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the Help to Buy incentive is one.  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy scheme should be considered.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market, including property prices, on an ongoing basis.  The Deputy will also be aware that I have committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive.  It will focus specifically on the workings of the incentive and its impact on the housing market generally, including any potential impact on property prices.  This findings of this assessment will be available later in the year, following the completion of the required public procurement processes, awarding of the contract and completion of the relevant analysis.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the relevant online application facilities were launched by the Revenue Commissioners on the 3rd of January 2017 and as such, the incentive has only been operational for just over two weeks.  In this regard, it would be very early to consider the measurement of the impact (if any) of the incentive.</p></reply>

This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks.</p>  <p>  All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 (APJ) set out a range of commitments to ensure viable SMEs can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources.  Finance for Growth will again feature in the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 and a number of actions have been proposed by my Department for inclusion in relation to this.</p>  <p>  In line with Action 144 of the APJ 2016, officials from my Department collated and examined data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to the various sectors.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p>  <p>  I note that the data recently published by the Central Bank of Ireland for Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises shows that new lending to Property Investment/Development enterprises for Q1 to Q3 2016 totalled &euro;961 million a growth of &euro;582 million (c. 154%) when compared to the same period in 2015.  This data can be found in Table A.14.1 Credit Advanced to Irish Resident Small and Medium Sized Enterprises published on the Central Bank's website.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in the social housing market, in line with the commitment contained in "Rebuilding Ireland", the NTMA and key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, including those involved in Property Investment/Development, and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.</p></reply>

The Credit Institutions Resolution Fund (CIRF)</p>  <p>  The CIRF was established under Section 10(1) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (2011 Act).  The Government contributed &euro;250m to the Fund in December 2011 to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of an authorised credit institution, and in particular- </p>  <p>  - To reimburse the Minister for any provision of a financial incentive pursuant to section 46;</p>  <p>  - To provide funds for any payment required pursuant to section 37(1), 42(5), 48 or 98;</p>  <p>  - With written consent of the Minister, to provide capital for a bridge-bank; and</p>  <p>  - To meet the Bank's expenses in discharging its functions under this Act.</p>  <p>The CIRF Levy commenced in October 2012 and levies collected from credit unions to date amount to &euro;28.9m.  Approximately &euro;30m has been used to support resolution actions in the credit union sector. </p>  <p>  2. The Stabilisation Fund</p>  <p>  In accordance with Part 4 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 credit unions contribute annually to a statutory Stabilisation Fund.  The Stabilisation Fund, contained within the Credit Union Fund, is available to all credit unions with a reserve ratio equal to or greater than 7.5% of the credit union's total assets and less than 10% and where the Central Bank assesses the credit union as viable.  Stabilisation support will be provided to address short-term problems at credit unions that are viable but undercapitalised.  Payment of an annual Stabilisation Levy commenced in 2015 (for a period commencing on 1 October 2014) and to date levies collected amount to &euro;6.4m.  There have been no drawdowns, to date, from the Stabilisation Fund.  A review of the Stabilisation Levy will be carried out in 2017.</p>  <p>  3. The Credit Union Fund</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Fund was established under section 57 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 for a number of purposes including the provision of stabilisation support, but primarily to provide a source of funding for the restructuring of credit unions under the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) and to meet the expenses of ReBo in discharging its functions.  The Government provided &euro;250 million to the Credit Union Fund specifically for restructuring under ReBo.  The Restructuring Levy (ReBo Levy) commenced in 2014 and to date levies collected amount to approximately &euro;5.27m.  Approximately &euro;13.75m has been drawn from the Credit Union Fund for restructuring purposes.  ReBo is expected to conclude its work in 2017.</p></reply>

These dialogues commenced in November 2015 with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify any changes that may be required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development.  Since the establishment of the Sector Stakeholder Dialogues seven meetings have taken place.  To date the focus has been on a number of areas including:</p><p>-  Longer term lending;</p><p>-  Additional services framework; and</p><p>-  Publication of sectoral data. </p><p>The Central Bank has recently approved a suite of additional services known as a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS) for 6 applicant credit unions under the Additional Services Framework set out in sections 48-52 of the Credit Union Act, 1997.  This represents an example of an additional service that has been approved by the Central Bank and it is open to credit unions to apply for similar approval for this service (this does not preclude a credit union from making an application for approval of any other additional service in accordance with sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act).  This MPCAS provides for credit unions to offer debit cards, overdrafts and a full range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.  The Central Bank has published details of MPCAS and the approval process, along with details of the application requirements and related guidance on its website.</p><p>The Registry of Credit Unions is also engaged on a number of other proposals, both from individual entities and at a sectoral level, including Mortgage Lending and Social Housing proposals from the representative bodies.  Funding greater longer term lending with short term funding (deposits) is a potential issue for credit unions with associated liquidity and asset liability management considerations.</p><p>In addition, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) made a number of recommendations in its recent substantial report presented to me on 29 June 2016.  An Implementation Group, comprising representatives from a number of credit union stakeholder groups, a CUAC member, a Central Bank Official and headed up by a Department of Finance Official, will meet in the coming weeks to begin overseeing and monitoring implementation of those recommendations.  It is expected that implementation of CUAC's recommendations will also assist credit unions in the area of business model development.</p></reply>

The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.  The individual credit union lending restrictions in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.</p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that circa 24% of credit unions (73 in total) are currently operating under lending restrictions compared with 52% at the start of the review process.  These include 8 credit unions with a monthly maximum lending restriction and 65 with a maximum individual loan size restriction.  In the majority of the relevant cases, the maximum individual loan size is in excess of &euro;10,000 as detailed in the following table. <table><tr><th>Lending Restriction on Individual Loans</th><th>Number of Credit Unions</th></tr><tr><td>10,000</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;10,000 and   20,000</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;20,000 and   30,000</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;30,000 and   40,000</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;40,000 and   50,000</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;50,000 and   60,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;60,000 and   70,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;70,000 and   80,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;80,000 and   90,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>&amp;gt;90,000 and   100,000</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>65 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (2016 Regulations) (which set out services exempt from additional services requirements) set out the services that a credit union may provide to its members. </p><p>Credit unions are not prohibited from providing mortgages to members.  However, mortgages are subject to the maturity limits contained in the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the Regulations) which set out the percentage of a credit union's loan book that can be outstanding for periods exceeding both 5 years and 10 years, as well as limits on the maximum outstanding liability to an individual member.  Under the Regulations, issued at the beginning of January 2016, credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions are able to apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.</p><p>As a first step to making the existing longer term lending limits more usable the Central Bank agreed to undertake work on potential changes to the conditions attaching to approvals for existing longer term lending limits as part of the sector stakeholder dialogue process.  Some initial proposals on how the conditions could be amended were put forward by the Central Bank for discussion within the sector stakeholder dialogue and the Central Bank now intends to publish revised conditions. </p><p>The September 2016 Prudential Return indicates that for the sector overall total gross loans over 10 years amount to 2.46% of total loans in the credit union sector compared to the limit of 10%.  73% of credit unions currently engaged in lending over 10 years have less than 3% of their total gross loans outstanding for over 10 years, and just 11% have more than 5% of their total gross loans outstanding for over 10 years.</p><p>Lending restrictions in credit unions are a matter for the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank, who, as the independent regulator for credit unions, acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.</p></reply>

These include loans; savings; account access by phone; account access by internet; third party payments (including EFT); ATM services; bureau de change; certain insurance services on an agency basis; group health insurance; bill payment; money transfers; standing orders; direct debits; financial counselling; PRSAs on an introduction basis and insurance on an introduction basis. </p>  <p>  Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  As set out in communications to the sector the Central Bank is, in principle, supportive of credit unions developing additional services and will consider proposals from credit unions on new additional services they wish to provide to members where the credit union can demonstrate that:</p>  <p>  -  the proposed additional service is supported by a robust business case;</p>  <p>  -  the proposed additional service is not contrary to financial services legislation;</p>  <p>  -  the board of directors has a sound appreciation of the nature of the additional service proposed and is fully informed of the strategic, governance, risk management, operational, financial and legal implications involved; and</p>  <p>  - systems and controls are in place to ensure any risks involved in the provision of the additional service are managed and mitigated. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that in the last five years, 11 applications for additional services have been approved, no application has been declined and there are currently no such applications in progress.  The majority of these applications have related to the provision of a Member Personal Current Account Service.  I have been further informed by the Central Bank that the timescale from preliminary application stage to full approval depends on the quality of information provided.  Where the application form has been fully completed and contains or includes all of the information requested, the Central Bank endeavours to turn around the application as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  In respect of debit cards, the Central Bank has been clear in its engagement with credit unions and other stakeholders who are seeking to offer this service, that it must be supported by the appropriate payment account service.  The Central Bank has recently approved a suite of additional services known as a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS) for 6 applicant credit unions under the Additional Services Framework set out in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.  The approved MPCAS service provides for credit unions to offer debit cards, overdrafts and a full range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework.  This represents an example of an additional service that has been approved by the Central Bank and it is open to credit unions to apply for similar approval for this service (this does not preclude a credit union from making an application for approval of any other additional service in accordance with sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act).  The Central Bank has published details of MPCAS on its website along with the approval process, details of the application requirements and related guidance. </p></reply>

The intention to backdate this tax incentive to this date was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the commencement of the incentive.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to backdate the scheme prior to 19 July, as to extend eligibility for the scheme further back than the date of its initial announcement would consist entirely of deadweight.  One of the primary policy aims of the incentive is to assist those struggling to save for the deposit required in purchasing a house.  Individuals who purchased new homes before the announcement of the incentive, did not need the assistance of the State to fund the required deposit.  Such individuals made their purchasing decisions on the basis of the information available to them at the time of purchase, and could not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to also be available to them.  Similarly, those who commenced the drawdown of agreed mortgages in respect of self built properties before 19th of July, could also not have expected a subsequently introduced tax relief to be available to them.</p>  <p>  As with all time bound reliefs, there will always be those who just miss out on qualification.

Rather it has acquired loans for which the properties act as security.</p>  <p>  NAMA has been very active in seeking to facilitate the provision of social housing through its portfolio wherever possible.  Working in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community &amp;amp; Local Government, NAMA offered residential units, for sale or lease, to the Housing Agency and to the local authorities.  This process has resulted in demand being confirmed for 2,748 units, of which 2,378 have already been delivered.  To ensure efficient delivery of these units, NAMA established a special purpose vehicle, NARPS, to acquire the properties and lease them directly, on a long-term commercial basis, to local authorities and approved housing bodies.  I am advised that, of the 2,378 houses and apartments delivered to date, 1,014 of these were delivered through NARPS and a further 337 properties are contracted for acquisition, but not yet complete.  I am further advised that the NARPs portfolio comprises properties primarily located in Dublin (43%) and Cork (23%) and is made of 61% apartments and 39% houses.</p>  <p>  Outside of NARPS, I am advised that NAMA holds 11 other properties, mainly land and development assets, which are zoned and designated for commercial use.  The majority of these were taken onto NAMA's balance sheet arising from legal and insolvency agreements and are intended for sale once such outstanding matters are resolved.  Nine of these assets are in Ireland with an additional two assets located abroad.</p>  <p>  Finally, due to the commercial sensitivity of such information, individual property valuations are not provided.  However I am advised that, in aggregate, the book value of these properties, including the NARPS properties, was approximately &euro;285m at 31 December 2016.</p></reply>

I am also conscious that where a bank comes into possession of a property the institution has a fiduciary responsibility to dispose of the property in a manner that satisfies its independent, commercial mandate.  However I welcome the fact that this is now also happening through interaction with the Housing Agency, local authorities or other means.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government this summer launched Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Action plan represents a whole of government response to the issues in the housing market with actionable measures across a wide range areas, designed to stimulate housing supply and remove many of the barriers to a normally functioning market.</p>  <p>  The Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy however I have received the following responses from the three banks in which the State has a shareholding: </p>  <p>  AIB</p>  <p>  All disclosures in relation to AIB's residential mortgages properties in possession can be found on page 53 of AIB's Half-Yearly Financial Report 2016.  It is the bank s policy to sell all assets on a vacant possession basis.  AIB has engaged directly with the Housing Agency to provide a list of more than 500 properties for consideration.  As at end of December the Housing Agency has expressed an interest in over 200 of these properties with 140 of these sale agreed.  AIB continues to work directly with the Housing Agency to ensure all suitable properties are made available for consideration.</p>  <p>PTSB</p>  <p>  Permanent TSB have informed me that all disclosures in relation to PTSB's residential mortgages and related properties in possession can be found on page 88 of PTSB's Half-Yearly Financial Report 2016.  It is PTSB's policy to sell all assets on a vacant possession basis.  The bank has also informed me that the actual number of vacant properties in Permanent TSB possession 31 December 2016 was 437 and within the last five months, the bank has completed one repossession sale to a local authority and one mortgage to rent sale to a housing body.  Separately PTSB has been engaging directly with the Housing Agency since 2015.</p>  <p>Bank of Ireland </p>  <p>  According to Bank of Ireland, all regulatory required disclosures for Bank of Ireland, including those related to property, can be found in their annual report.</p></reply>

In June 2016 the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) carried out a review, at my request, of the Implementation of the Recommendations set out in the Report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  This significant report provides an indepth analysis of the sector.  Its recommendations are based on that analysis and on the views of a range of stakeholders, thus ensuring a balanced report providing focused and effective recommendations.  CUACs recommendations are set out under seven specific headings: tiered regulation, section 35, consultation and engagement with the Central Bank, governance, restructuring, business model development and additional matters.  The report also fulfils one of the key credit union objectives as outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  An Implementation Group, comprising representatives from a number of credit union stakeholder groups, from CUAC, from the Central Bank and headed up by a Department of Finance Official, will meet in the coming weeks to begin overseeing and monitoring implementation of those recommendations.  It is expected that implementation of those recommendations will assist credit unions in developing their business models. </p>  <p>  The Government wants not only strong, vibrant credit unions offering a safe and secure place for members' savings but also credit unions' being appropriately positioned to offer their members a wide range of services including loans, debit card facilities and new facilities based on the needs of their membership.  </p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland and the Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.  </p></reply>

The SBCI does not lend directly to SMEs, rather it channels its funds through lending partners, known as on-lenders.  At present, the SBCI has eight on-lending partners, including both bank and non-bank finance providers. </p>  <p>  The SBCI received initial funding of &euro;800 million from EIB, KfW and the NPRF (now ISIF) to support its lending activity.  It has since also received further long term funding from the NTMA and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  The SBCI now has a funding capacity of over &euro;1.2 billion to support Irish SMEs investing in and growing their businesses.  In December 2016, the SBCI signed a risk sharing agreement under the COSME programme with the European Investment Fund.  This facility will be used to support the delivery of additional credit to the Irish market through SBCI guarantee products in 2017.</p>  <p>  To the end of September 2016, over 10,600 SMEs, operating across all business and economic sectors of the Irish economy, have benefitted from &euro;458 million of SBCI loans.  There is a broad geographical spread of the SMEs supported with the majority of them based outside Dublin.  I understand that the SBCI will make its lending figures to the end of December 2016 available in the coming weeks and these will be published on its website. </p>  <p>  The level of lending to SMEs through the SBCI is ultimately driven by market demand.  However, the SBCI is seeking new on-lenders to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage as well as encouraging competition in the SME Finance Market. </p></reply>

Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.</p>  <p>  Early intervention classes are intended to provide early support for children with ASD before they start school.  Following early intervention children will attend a mainstream class unless there is professional guidance that they require a special class.</p>  <p>  Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special classes for students with ASD are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 Ss for a class of 6 children.</p>  <p>  Students enrolled in special classes should be included in mainstream classes to the greatest extent possible, in line with their abilities.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD Primary special class placements to meet existing demand in the area referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  With regard to future potential need in this area, the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in the area to open special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO and parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes. These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The project was included in the five year construction programme 2012-16 and was scheduled therein to commence construction in 2014.  </p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted in January 2014.  however, since then the Board of Management and its design team have presented a number of proposals to the Department to change the brief for the project to one which involves a single decant and a single phased delivery during construction.  This has led to significant delays in the progression of the project. The most recent decant option, which included the provision of significant levels of new temporary accommodation on site involved an additional cost for the project in the region of &euro;2 million &ndash; an increase in the overall cost of the project of around 40%. </p>  <p>  The additional &euro;2 million cost for the project arising from the Board of Management's single phase decant and construction proposal raised serious questions as to the viability of the project. </p>  <p>  A meeting was convened by my Department, to which the Board of Management and their Design Team were invited in order to resolve any outstanding issues in this regard to enable Stage 2b to be finalised.   </p>  <p>  That meeting was held on the 11th November and agreement was reached in relation to a scaling back of the temporary accommodation costs which should now allow the project to progress to the completion of the design stages. </p>  <p>  When the revised Stage 2(b) submission has been submitted and approved, my Department will revert to the Board of Management at that time with regard to the further progression of the project to tender and construction.  As with any project the progression to tender and construction will be contingent on the availability of funding at time.  </p></reply>

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.  Having considered the matter and taking into account all circumstances both the union and management partners considered that their preferred option is to retain the existing scheme as set out in the published circular.</p>  <p>  However, in response to a request for consideration of a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers, I have decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for those teachers in their fifth and sixth year of exchange for one further year. </p></reply>

Under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is mandated to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for the State.  As such, NAMA's dealings with its debtors, as well as the management, funding and sale of assets are all commercial decisions taken with consideration to NAMA's commercial obligations.</p>  <p>  Following proactive engagement between NAMA, the Housing Agency and my Department, a process was established to ascertain whether residential properties made available by NAMA, through its borrowers and receivers, are suitable for social housing. </p>  <p>  The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired. In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA. Once a demand has been identified, NAMA makes contact with the relevant property owner/receiver to determine if the properties are still available and to discuss how these properties can be best utilised.   </p>  <p>  Properties that are deemed suitable may be leased or purchased by local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (housing associations and co-operatives) through engagement with the property owners or, on their behalf, appointed insolvency practitioners, facilitated by NAMA.  This is a continuous process and additional properties have been added and offered as they become available over the last number of years.  To end-2016, 2,378 properties have been secured for social housing under this initiative.  A further 370 properties are at Terms Agreed/Active Negotiation/Pre-Appraisal stages.  While NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the pool of such properties is reducing in line with the wider NAMA portfolio and at this stage it is unlikely that significant numbers of additional properties will be identified.  However, the Steering Group remains active and will continue to work through any potential units that may arise.   </p>  <p>  In addition to this Social Housing initiative, NAMA is making a very substantial contribution, on a commercial basis, to the increased supply of new homes through its residential delivery programme.  Against the background of major supply shortage in urban areas, NAMA has undertaken to fund the delivery of up to 20,000 residential units by 2020.  Residential developments funded by NAMA are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments.  This includes policies relating to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and as such, it is expected that a minimum of 10% of the anticipated output of this investment by NAMA, or about 2,000 units, will become available for social housing through this statutory mechanism over this period.   </p></reply>

The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.  A first-time buyer unable to get a loan from a building society or a bank, may be eligible for a mortgage from the local authority concerned to purchase a new or second hand property or build their own home.  The loan can be up to 97% of the price of the house subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  A local authority mortgage is an annuity mortgage with variable interest rates, so repayments will go up and down in line with interest rate changes.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012. Key eligibility criteria provide that a loan applicant must be a first-time buyer and must be able to show their local authority that they cannot get a loan from a bank or building society.  Also, the gross income (before tax) of a single-income household in the previous year must be &euro;50,000 or less and the combined gross income (before tax) of a two-income household in the previous year must be &euro;75,000 or less.  Prospective applicants should contact their relevant local authority for further information.</p><p>The second option is the Home Choice Loan, which is available for first-time buyers to purchase a new or second-hand property or build their own home.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to the Home Choice Loan are set out in the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009.  Home Choice Loan provides up to 92% of the market value of a property purchased, subject to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  The loan is a normal capital and interest bearing mortgage which is repaid on a monthly basis.  Home Choice Loan offers one variable interest rate.  The rate is currently set at 3.25% variable, APR 3.30%.  Further information is available at . </p><p>To support local authorities in operating their housing loan schemes in a consistent and efficient manner, the Housing Agency provides a central underwriting service to local authorities.  The credit underwriting process considers the impact that family circumstances may have on the loan applicant&rsquo;s capacity to make loan repayments.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the relevant statutory Credit Policy that underpins the scheme and aims to ensure prudent lending.</p><p>I will be reviewing the operation of both schemes by end Q1 2017.</p></reply>

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this and that they provide for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These income limits will continue to be kept under review by my Department, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda set out in the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>.</p><p>I am aware of the difficulties experienced by some households in purchasing their own home where they are not eligible for social housing support on income grounds.  It may be possible for such households to avail of a mortgage from a local authority which is targeted at lower income first-time buyers who can demonstrate that they are unable to get a loan from a building society or bank.  A loan can be up to 97% of the price of the property, subject to a maximum loan of &euro;200,000.  The relevant terms and conditions applying to local authority housing loans are set out in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012, which prescribe a maximum annual gross income threshold of &euro;50,000 for a single person household or a combined annual gross income of &euro;75,000 for a two person household.  The Regulations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012.</p><p>Another option is the Home Choice Loan for first time buyers.  The Home Choice Loan is available through authorised mortgage brokers and can be used to provide up to 92% of the market value of the property being purchased, up to a maximum loan amount of &euro;285,000.  A new or second hand property may be purchased under the scheme.  Further information is available at: www.homechoiceloan.ie.</p><p>On 13 December 2016, the Government approved the publication of a Strategy for the Rental Sector.  The Strategy identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Rental Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards. </p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country where rents are high and rising will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas will be capped at 4% per annum for a period of three years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City. </p><p>The Strategy recognises the difficulties facing households on moderate incomes in accessing affordable rental accommodation in high pressure areas and includes short-term actions by relevant local authorities to use publicly owned sites to kick-start supply of more affordable rental units for such households. In this regard Dublin City Council will be launching a call for Expressions of Interest in relation to three Dublin sites.

This comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.</p><p>A strong pipeline of social housing build projects is now in place.  Taking the main local authority housing construction programme as an example, there are now some 255 projects, including 20 turnkey projects, at various stages in the programme, with a capacity to deliver over 4,000 new social homes.  These range from large-scale new developments to smaller, infill projects.  On rapid builds projects, 350 units are now advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, across a number of Dublin sites and this will be added to with an additional 650 units this year, with a further 500 units following in 2018.  Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, there are over 100 Approved Housing Body projects in the pipeline, which will deliver around 1,000 units.  As a further example, under the PPP programme, nearly 1,000 new social units are now in planning with local authorities.</p><p>The momentum of approvals will continue in 2017 in order to add to the pipeline and provide the basis for delivering on the increased Rebuilding Ireland targets.  Data in relation to the full pipeline of projects is being updated at present and the intention is that this will be finalised and published in conjunction with the next Rebuilding Ireland quarterly implementation report in the coming weeks.</p><p>This is in addition to current-funded programmes, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme, Housing Assistance Payment and various leasing arrangements under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme. Again properties sourced under these programmes are used to accommodate persons on the local authority housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation or at risk of homelessness.</p><p>While the construction programme is being advanced, I have also strongly supported local authorities in the acquisition of new and previously owned houses/apartments.  In 2016, I provided over &euro;175 million to local authorities for such acquisitions and these approaches are delivering early social housing solutions for people in need of social housing.</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>contains a number of integrated actions to underpin active land supply management for the delivery of housing.  Initially, this involves identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable homes, to meet demand.</p><p>The Housing Agency, in close consultation with my Department and local authorities, has already commenced the mapping of approximately 700 sites in local authority ownership and those held by the Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.</p><p>This map will form part of the broader National Land Supply Management Strategy (as committed to under Action 3.5 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>), which is being developed within the context of the National Planning Framework (NPF).  In this regard, an initial public consultation process will commence later this month with the aim of finalising the NPF later in 2017. Once collated, the map will be made available, and will be updated to record the development and use of these lands.</p><p>With regard to the availability of land in private ownership, the <i>Residential Land Availability Survey 2014</i>, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: , indicated that there was 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.  The mapped results of the survey are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .  A further Residential Land Availability Survey will be undertaken in due course.</p><p>A suite of actions is being implemented under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, building on actions already underway, to ensure these sites are activated, to increase the supply of homes, at a far greater scale and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  For example, targeted reductions in development contribution requirements have been introduced and &euro;200m in State funding is being provided for key enabling infrastructure, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund.</p><p>In this regard, in November 2016, under Pillar 3 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, I announced details of 23 Major Urban Housing Development Sites, with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand over the next 3-4 years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.  Further details on these sites can be accessed here: .</p></reply>

A further 650 rapid build homes will be advanced in 2017, with another 500 units to be delivered in 2018.</p>  <p>  There has been significant pressure to ramp-up rapid build delivery, which local authorities have been responding to positively.  Of particular note is the establishment of a framework of rapid build contractors by the Office of Government Procurement, which means that local authorities across the country will be able to run quicker procurement competitions and advance rapid build projects to site more efficiently and effectively.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the rapid build programme needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of social housing build, acquisition and leasing programmes, which are being advanced by local authorities and approved housing bodies (AHBs).</p></reply>

The Guidelines also aim to ensure that sites being developed for rural housing are suitable with regard to access and wastewater disposal, and also from landscape and design perspectives.</p><p>It is a matter for individual planning authorities to prepare their development plans and the policies contained within such plans, taking account of local and varying geographical and landscape circumstances, as well as the approaches set out under the Guidelines in relation to rural- generated housing.  It is also a matter for planning authorities, as well as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to implement the Guidelines and local planning policies in assessing and deciding on individual planning applications and appeals under the development management consent process.</p><p>My Department maintains a constant overview of the practical implementation of all statutory planning guidelines, including the 2005 <i>Rural Housing Guidelines</i>.  I intend to keep the Guidelines under review, particularly in view of the commitments in the Government&rsquo;s <i><i>Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland</i></i><i></i>which aim to accelerate the delivery of housing in order to address the current housing supply shortage and the projected housing needs over the coming years, contributing to wider objectives, including the need to support sustainable urban and rural development and communities.</p></reply>

This indicates clearly the central role of construction activity in the supply of new social housing stock under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.</p><p>To support this key role for construction, there is now a very substantial pipeline of new social housing construction projects in place.  This is being added to on an ongoing basis in line with the ambitious targets of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.  These projects are now at various stages of advancement, ranging from planning and development work by local authorities, across to projects that are on site.  I am keen that they are all advanced as quickly as possible and I have assured the local authorities that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard.</p><p>While the construction programme has been advancing, it has made sense that local authorities take opportunities to acquire housing where there is a social housing need and where good value for money can be obtained and I am satisfied that they are deploying options to both buy and to build new social housing in a balanced way.  It is important that they utilise all opportunities to develop new social housing but the mix will increasingly switch towards construction on foot of the substantial pipeline of projects now in place.</p></reply>

A further 53 units were secured under long-term leasing arrangements supported through the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme.  An additional 381 households were supported by HAP in Galway County Council with 336 households being supported in Galway City at the end of 2016.</p><p>During 2016, I also provided over &euro;1.2 million to the Galway local authorities to purchase new and previously owned houses and apartments for use as social housing units.

My Department is responsible for the legislative framework governing local authorities, which include measures relating to the financing of local authorities and financial governance.  In this regard, section 99 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that payments may be made out of the funds of a local authority on the authorisation of the chief executive, or by an employee of the local authority nominated by the chief executive.  The legislation also provides that in each case, the payments must be counter-authorised by an employee, other than the person who authorised the payment.  The chief executive is responsible for performing all executive functions of a local authority, including functions under section 99 of the Local Government Act 2001 and I have no function in that regard.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the specific case in Meath County Council referred to in the question.  Moreover, I understand that this matter is the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>  <p>  The elected council has primary responsibility for governance and oversight generally of the local authority.  The Local Government Act 2001 also includes specific measures to provide oversight of the financial governance arrangements in place within local authorities.  Section 122 of the Act requires each local authority to establish an audit committee.  The functions of the audit committee include: the review of financial and budgetary reporting practices within the local authority; and the development of best practice by the local authority of its internal audit function.  The accounts of each local authority are subject to statutory audit annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  The local government auditors are independent in the performance of their professional functions and may prepare a report on any matter which comes to notice during the course of the audit.  Any implications arising from such reports for the financial governance legislative framework would be considered carefully by my Department.</p></reply>

Activity by institutional and professional residential sector investment specialists such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) in purchasing housing and engaging in the building out of part completed schemes and commencing new housing projects is a positive signal of investment beginning to flow back into the housing sector to provide increased housing supply<i>.</i></p><p>The acquisition and management of properties by REITS is one component part of a more sustainable, long-term property rental market for both investors and tenants.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and in so doing to increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, secure and affordable rented accommodation.  Investments by REITs that increase the number of dwellings available in the rented sector are a positive development.  That said, a diverse sector, which includes both institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects and small scale and individual landlords, is inherently more stable and less exposed to property market risk and volatility. </p><p>Historically the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Attracting large scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.</p><p>In cases where buy-to-let mortgages are sold on by the original lender, the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and tenant and the terms of the mortgage are unaffected.  However, I am very aware of the scale of the problem of debt distressed landlords.  There are more than 25,000 buy to let mortgage accounts in arrears and more than half of these have arrears of over two years.  In many cases, when these result in receivership and repossession, the lender does seek to sell the property with vacant possession, although such cases only come to the attention of the Residential Tenancies Board when a dispute arises.  Under the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>, published in December, my Department is establishing a working group with the participation of the Departments of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, Finance, and Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, to explore the scope for landlord obligations to be transferred to receivers in such cases.  The Working Group will report by the end of March this year.</p><p>In relation to the numbers of tenants that have been served with notices of termination for the purposes of vacant sales, my Department does not hold or collate the information requested.</p></reply>

This engagement is being intensified in 2017. </p>  <p>  On 18 November last, I attended the North South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh where a discussion on the implications of the UK Referendum took place.  While to date I have not held any bilateral meetings with my European counterparts, the Taoiseach and Ministers will continue to meet and engage with our EU counterparts over the coming weeks to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to ensure that they are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence. </p>  <p>  This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  The Government is acutely aware of the potential risks and challenges for the Irish economy and will remain fully engaged on this aspect as the negotiations proceed.  An important part of our preparations for the Brexit negotiations is ensuring that our particular concerns are heard and understood across Europe and engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is, therefore, critical. </p>  <p>  Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team and looks forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU. In line with the agreement at EU level, there have been and will be no negotiations with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.   </p></reply>

In this regard, Action 5.1 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>commits to developing a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by the first quarter of 2017, informed by Census 2016 data, to:</p><p>- inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country,</p><p>- identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies (i.e. over 6 months) in high demand areas, and</p><p>- set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into reuse.</p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group, comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the Strategy.  The Working Group has met five times to date.</p><p>As indicated, it is intended to facilitate the development of a national database of vacant houses under the auspices of the National Vacant Housing Re-use Strategy.  The database will aim to include</p><p>- the number of vacant homes in each local authority area,</p><p>- the addresses of the vacant homes,</p><p>- the length of vacancy in each case, and</p><p>- the reason(s) for vacancy.</p><p>Work is progressing on identifying possible sources of data and information to assist in the most efficient means of compiling such a database. </p><p>While the development of the Strategy is being progressed, I have already announced a number of new initiatives under Pillar 5 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>aimed at addressing vacancy and facilitating the reuse of vacant houses.  A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.  The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and it is my intention that the scheme will be available nationally by April 2017.  I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this scheme over the next five years.  It has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021. </p><p>In addition, under a new Buy and Renew initiative, my Department will support local authorities and AHBs in purchasing private housing units in need of remediation, having them refurbished and making them available for social housing use.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million is being made available for this initiative in 2017.</p></reply>

The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2017 commences Part 3 of the Act, insofar as it is not already in operation, other than sections 44, 45, 48 and 49.  This Commencement Order takes effect from 17 January 2017.  Under Part 3 of the Act, Sections 38 to 40 provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time (i.e. classified as being within a 6-month period), the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.  Where, before the commencement of section 40 of the Act, a valid notice of termination has been served on a tenant on the ground that the landlord wishes to sell his/her property, then that notice takes effect as if section 40 had not commenced.</p><p>However, I understand that, in the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the termination notices issued before the commencement of Section 40 have since been withdrawn, in which case the protections under Section 40 of the Act apply to the tenancies in question.  If the owner proceeds to sell ten or more of the dwellings at one time this can only be done with the tenants in situ, unless the tenant agrees to voluntarily end the tenancy or the owner can demonstrate that the price obtainable for the property is more than 20% below the market value that could be obtained with vacant possession and that this would be unduly onerous or cause undue hardship to them.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented residential sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants relating to, inter alia, security of tenure and the termination of tenancies.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p><p>Where a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months and less than 6 years, sections 34 and 35 of the Act now provides that, if the landlord is claiming an exemption from the new protections, they must demonstrate in the termination notice that the conditions for an exemption apply in the case &ndash; i.e. that the price obtainable for the property is more than 20% below the market value that could be obtained with vacant possession and that this would be unduly onerous or cause undue hardship to them.</p><p>Section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides that where there is an abuse of the termination procedure, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord.  On the hearing of the complaint the RTB, it if considers it proper to do so, may make a direction that damages are paid to the tenant, that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both.  </p><p>Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act.  Where there is a dispute regarding the appropriate period of notice to be given in respect of a tenancy or the validity of a notice of termination, the dispute may be referred to the RTB for resolution.</p></reply>

The legislation underpinning the means assessment of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist schemes is set out in the Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the <i>Social Welfare Consolidation Act</i>of 2005 (as amended).</p><p>The reference to expenses in legislation can be found in Table 2 in Schedule 3 of the 2005 Act (as amended) which lists 19 items that are excluded from the assessment of income.  Number 17 in this list is &ldquo;<i>any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on any form of self-employment</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>There is no exhaustive list of all expenses allowed in self-employed cases, since expenses vary with the nature and extent of the self-employment.  However, the following are the main allowable expenses in most instances, as set out in the means guidelines available on the Departmental website:  </p><p>- Materials (supplies costs) </p><p>- Motor running costs (portion applicable to business) </p><p>- Depreciation of machinery or equipment </p><p>- Insurance relating to the business </p><p>- Telephone (portion applicable to business) </p><p>- Lighting and Heating (for business and not domestic use) </p><p>- Advertising </p><p>- Bank Charges </p><p>- Stationery </p><p>- Van Leasing </p><p>- Labour Costs </p><p>- Pension plan </p><p>- Any other costs associated with running the business. </p><p>- Class S PRSI contributions (where paid or payable). </p><p>Lower income farmers may be entitled to a payment under the farm assist scheme.  It should be noted that Budget 2017 contained a number of improvements to the means testing arrangements of the Farm Assist scheme, which may be of interest to your constituent.  From March, there will be an enhanced assessment of means from farming, whereby 70% of farm income (after allowing for expenses necessarily incurred) will be assessed as means (down from 100%).  Furthermore, additional income disregards for claimants with children will be introduced.</p></reply>

Participants improve their employability and work readiness through work opportunities with structured environments where existing work skills can be put into practice.

On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce a number of important measures which will benefit the self-employed. </p>  <p>  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits (these improvements will benefit both the self-employed and employees).</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit in 2017 from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports.  These measures are all part of the Government&rsquo;s policy of making work pay and encouraging self-employment and entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets.  In 2017, my Department will examine the extension of social insurance to cover new risks and contingencies, including developing proposals on a form of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit where a person's business fails or they can no longer continue working in their profession or trade.</p></reply>

Its main aim was to help unemployed jobseekers to break the vicious cycle of &lsquo;no experience no job, but no job no experience&rsquo;.  Since then over 19,000 Host Organisations have offered work placement opportunities to over 48,000 participants.  A detailed breakdown of participants on a county basis is available in Appendix 1.</p><p>My Department does not compile the detailed progression statistics on an annual basis requested, however the findings of the recent external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Economic Consultants shows that it has been very effective in improving the employment outcomes of jobseekers.  It indicates that 79% of participants &ndash; over 38,000 people &ndash; have had some period of employment since completing their placement, with over 64% still in employment.  Compared to non-participants, jobseekers who participated in JobBridge improved their employment outcomes by 32%.  By any measure this is a significant uplift and shows that placements with a direct link to an employer deliver higher employment outcomes than other options.</p><p>Appendix 2 contains tables on employment progression outcomes highlighted in the Indecon evaluation.  Table 5.13 shows progression outcomes by length of time since the internship finished.  Table 5.10 shows the current employment status of participants by sector of Host Organisations.  The complete evaluation can be found at: .  <b></b></p><p>Just under half (45%) of all placements finish early &ndash; for a variety of reasons.  Almost half (49%) of those who finish early say it is to take up employment and a further 7% go on to further education, training or another internship.  About 30% leave for a variety of personal, domestic or health reasons.  14% leave early because they did not find the internship suitable, which is not surprising given that, for many, JobBridge is a first-chance opportunity and sometimes participants find that the particular career direction is not for them.  The Department continues to work with them to support them with a range of alternative pathways to work.  Appendix 3 provides an annual breakdown on a county basis of the number of participants who dropped out of the scheme before completion.</p><p>An annual breakdown of the total number of companies that were suspended from participation in the scheme for any period since its inception is attached in Appendix 4.  The table also highlights the number of participants in those companies, broken down by employment sector.  No companies were suspended in 2011 or 2016.  The Jobbridge scheme is no longer open to new participants or host organisations as such.  There are no companies currently disqualified or suspended from participation in the scheme. </p><p>All participants are entitled to a quality work experience and every reasonable effort is made by my Department to minimise the risk of exploitation of the scheme by Host Organisations.  All complaints are taken seriously, fully investigated and appropriate action taken in cases of non-compliance.</p><p>In addition to responding to complaints, my Department operates a robust monitoring regime and has conducted over 13,000 on-site inspection visits.  The evidence from these inspections is that the vast majority of host organisations are fully compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In fact, of the more than 19,000 Host Organisations that have participated in JobBridge, a total of 86 (less than half of 1%) have been suspended from participating in the scheme for any period.  </p><p>The level of misuse of the scheme is therefore much lower than is popularly thought and this position has been confirmed by the Indecon evaluation.  The scheme is viewed positively by the majority of participants.  For example 70% of participants reported a quality work experience.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I intend to replace JobBridge with a new work experience programme later this year that is better suited to the much-improved labour market and addresses criticisms of the scheme.  JobBridge was closed to new applications from October 2016 to allow for a period of consultation with key stakeholders on design principles that I announced and to facilitate an orderly wind down of the existing scheme.  These consultations are currently underway.</p><p><b>Appendix 1</b></p><p><b>Number of participants by county*</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>693</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>682</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>998</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>4,343</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1,611</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>15,274</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>3,079</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1,553</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>1,745</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>713</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>695</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>305</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>2,613</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>369</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1,346</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>1,314</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>1,187</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>848</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>663</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>431</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>914</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>1,536</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1,592</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1,231</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1,399</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1,018</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>48,152</td></tr></table><blockquote>*Figures as of July 2016</blockquote><b>Appendix 2</b></p><p><b>Employment Progression Outcomes of Participants</b></p><p><b>Table 5.13: Progression Outcomes - If Intern Gained Paid Employment at any Stage since Internship by Length of Time since Internship Finishing (Percentage of Respondents)</b><table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Completed Internship Less than 1 Month</th><th>Completed 1-2<br /><br />Months</th><th>Completed 3-4<br /><br />Months</th><th>Completed 5-6<br /><br />Months</th><th>Completed 7-12<br /><br />Months</th><th>Completed 13-24<br /><br />Months</th><th>Completed Over 24 Months Ago</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>All Responses</td><td>May 2016</td><td>March- April 2016</td><td>January- February 2016</td><td>November- December 2015</td><td>May- October 2015</td><td>April 2015-<br /><br />May 2014</td><td>Before May 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Gained paid employment at any stage since internship</td><td>79.1%</td><td>41.0%</td><td>53.8%</td><td>57.8%</td><td>66.2%</td><td>70.7%</td><td>79.2%</td><td>88.8%</td></tr></table><b><i>Source: Indecon and DSP Confidential Survey of JobBridge Interns</i></b></p><p><b>Table 5.10: Progression Outcomes - Current Status of Intern by Sector of Host Organisation</b></p><p><b>(Percentage of Respondents)</b><table><tr><th>Please indicate which of the following best<br /><br />describes your current situation:</th><th><br /><br />All Responses</th><th><div>Private Sector/Commercial Organisation (incl.<br /><br />Commercial Semi-State Organisations)</div></th><th><div>Public Sector Organisation (incl.

On 19 December, I issued a statement condemning the brutal assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov.  On 1 January, I issued a statement following the shooting at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul in the early hours of that morning.  I unreservedly condemned this unspeakable attack, in which 39 people tragically lost their lives.  I extended my condolences to the families of the deceased and injured in these heinous events, and to all the people of Turkey, who have suffered a surge in violent, terrorist attacks over the past year, carried out mainly by the outlawed PKK and its affiliates or ISIS.</p>  <p>  The situation in Turkey was discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 November.  Turkey was also extensively discussed in the context of Enlargement at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 13 December.

All the people of Turkey, including minorities, deserve the prospect of a future in keeping with European values and it is important to keep the long-term rights and interests of all of the people of Turkey in mind in our discussion on EU-Turkey relations.    </p>  <p>  Turkey was also briefly discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 January and I expect that there will be further discussions at future meetings</p>  <p>  It is clear that the situation in Turkey remains very difficult.  Ireland, along with our European partners, stand in solidarity with Turkey in the fight against terrorism.</p>  <p>  While the Turkish authorities clearly need to combat terrorism vigorously and effectively, they must also maintain a measured and proportionate response which upholds the rule of law.  This balanced approach has been conveyed clearly on a number of occasions by me and by the EU since last summer&rsquo;s attempted coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat.</p></reply>

This engagement is being intensified in 2017 in the run up to the Article 50 negotiations. </p><p>This outreach is an important part of our preparations for the Brexit negotiations to ensure that our particular concerns &ndash; the economy, Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself - are heard and understood across Europe.</p><p>For my own part, I have spoken at least once with each of my EU Foreign Minister opposite numbers.  These discussions either took place over the phone or in person, sometimes in the margins of other meetings I attended such as the EU ASEM Ministerial meeting last July, or the monthly Foreign Affairs Council meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg.  The list of my formal engagements since 23 June is presented in the following Table.  It is important to note that alongside these formal discussions, I engage on an informal basis very regularly with my EU counterparts including in the margins of EU FAC meetings and other international and multilateral gatherings.  I also discuss Brexit matters in the context of Northern Ireland on a regular basis with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.</p><p>Most recently, I met with the Spanish Foreign Minister on 16 January and I hope to have bilateral discussions with my Luxembourg and Finnish counterpart in the weeks ahead.  Engagement with EU Embassies in Dublin is also critically important, and to that end I have scheduled a meeting with the local EU Ambassadors this Friday (20 January). </p><p>The Government will continue to meet and engage with their EU counterparts over coming weeks to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s priority issues, to ensure that these are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence.</p><p>This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  </p><p>Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team and looks forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.</p><p>Finally, I would note that there has also been extensive contact with the UK government since the June referendum.  Last year, I met with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis.  In line with the agreement at EU level that there should be no negotiations until Article 50 has been triggered, these discussions focused on bilateral issues.</p><p><b>Formal engagement by Minister Flanagan with EU counterparts since 23 June 2016</b><table><tr><th>DATE</th><th>COUNTRY</th><th>NAME</th><th>Venue</th></tr><tr><td>24/06/16</td><td>France</td><td>Jean-Marc Ayrault</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>24/06/16</td><td>UK</td><td>Philip Hammond</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>27/06/16</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>Bert Koenders</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>06/07/16</td><td>Slovakia</td><td>Miroslav Lacjak</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>08/07/16</td><td>Germany</td><td>Frank-Walter Steinmeier</td><td>Berlin</td></tr><tr><td>08/07/16</td><td>Sweden</td><td>Margot Wallstrom</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>12/07/16</td><td>Bulgaria</td><td>Daniel Mitov</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>12/07/16</td><td>Italy</td><td>Paolo Gentiloni</td><td>Dublin</td></tr><tr><td>12/07/16</td><td>Lithuania</td><td>Linas Linkevicius</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>15/07/16</td><td>Belgium</td><td>Didier Reynders</td><td>EU-ASEM</td></tr><tr><td>15/07/16</td><td>Denmark</td><td>Kristian Jensen</td><td>EU-ASEM</td></tr><tr><td>15/07/16</td><td>Greece</td><td>Nikolaos Kotzias</td><td>EU-ASEM</td></tr><tr><td>15/07/16</td><td>Hungary</td><td>Peter Szijjarto</td><td>EU-ASEM</td></tr><tr><td>15/07/16</td><td>Portugal</td><td>Augusto Santos Silva</td><td>EU-ASEM</td></tr><tr><td>18/07/16</td><td>Cyprus</td><td>Ionnis Kasoulides</td><td>Brussels</td></tr><tr><td>18/07/16</td><td>Czech Republic</td><td>Lubomir Zaoralek</td><td>Brussels</td></tr><tr><td>18/07/16</td><td>Estonia</td><td>Marina Kaljurand</td><td>Brussels</td></tr><tr><td>18/07/16</td><td>Luxembourg</td><td>Jean Asselborn</td><td>Brussels</td></tr><tr><td>18/07/16</td><td>UK</td><td>Boris Johnson</td><td>Brussels</td></tr><tr><td>19/07/16</td><td>Croatia</td><td>Miro Kovac</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>19/07/16</td><td>Finland</td><td>Timo Soini</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>20/07/16</td><td>Austria</td><td>Sebastian Kurz</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>20/07/16</td><td>Latvia</td><td>Edgars Rinkevics</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>25/07/16</td><td>Romania</td><td>Lazar Comanescu</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>27/07/16</td><td>Poland</td><td>Witold Waszczykowski</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>03/08/16</td><td>Malta</td><td>George Vella</td><td>Phonecall</td></tr><tr><td>31/08/16</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>Bert Koenders</td><td>Dublin</td></tr><tr><td>02/09/16</td><td>Cyprus</td><td>Ionnis Kasoulides</td><td>Bratislava</td></tr><tr><td>02/09/16</td><td>Malta</td><td>George Vella</td><td>Bratislava</td></tr><tr><td>02/09/16</td><td>Slovenia</td><td>Karl Erjavec</td><td>Bratislava</td></tr><tr><td>08/09/16</td><td>UK</td><td>David Davis</td><td>Dublin</td></tr><tr><td>12/10/16</td><td>E.

However, most public servants recruited since 1995, including Single Scheme members, are subject to the following occupational pension scheme contribution rates:</p><p>-  3% of pay, plus</p><p>-  3.5% of net pay (which is defined as pay minus twice the Contributory State Pension).</p><p>Irish public service pension schemes operate on an unfunded pay-as-you-go basis, being exempt from the funding standard requirements set down in Part IV of the Pensions Act 1990.  On that account public service schemes, with only minor exceptions, do not feature an explicit employer contribution.  They do however have a significant implicit employer contribution, insofar as the cost of taxpayer-financed benefit outgo, generally based on final salary, significantly exceeds member contributions.  This implicit employer contribution is widely recognised as a valuable benefit in public service employment, including in the second report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body published in 2007, which is available at .</p><p>The minimum age at which normal-course pensions are paid in the Irish public service varies by reference to period of recruitment, as follows:</p><p>-  60 years for persons recruited up to 31 March 2004.</p><p>-  65 years for persons recruited between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2012.</p><p>-  66 years, rising to 67 years in 2021 and 68 years in 2028, for persons recruited from 1 January 2013 onward: these persons are members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, which applies to new recruits across the public service since the beginning of 2013.  The Single Scheme pension benefits are based on career-average pay, not retirement-time pay (final salary).</p><p>Retirement lump sum in almost all public service pension schemes, except the Single Scheme, is set at a maximum of one and a half times final pay. </p><p>In general, 40 years' service is required to qualify for maximum public service pension benefits. </p><p>Single Scheme members may accrue both pension and retirement lump sum over a longer period than 40 years. For most Single Scheme members, there are no legislated rules capping the level of pension and retirement lump sum that can be accrued; in practice however the Single Scheme's career-average design is a restraint on benefits build-up under those headings.</p><p>Responsibility for all aspects of taxation relating to pensions rests with my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

This includes the honeybee, 20 species of bumblebee and many more species of solitary bee.  They are significant pollinators of wild species of plants, but also crops and garden plants.</p><p>Honeybee colonies in Ireland are mostly artificially maintained and the species does not fall under the remit of my Department.  However, the problems affecting honeybees, such as starvation, disease and pesticides, can also impact on wild bees and my Department recognises the need to address these issues. </p><p>While the Red List of threatened species of bees in Ireland, published in 2006, recognised a decline in the bee population, my Department is involved in several initiatives, such as the EU funded BurrenLIFE and AranLIFE projects, which have at their core the goal of restoring species-rich habitats that will benefit pollinators, especially wild species of bees.  My Department also owns and manages an extensive network of protected sites, including National Parks and Nature Reserves, that support some of Ireland&rsquo;s rarest bees as well as providing a suitable habitat for many common species.</p><p>Ireland is one of a small number of countries in Europe to have developed a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services.  In conjunction with other governmental and non-governmental organisations, my Department has played a key role in supporting and endorsing the <i>All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, 2015-2020. </i>The Plan provides an important framework to bring together pollinator initiatives from the North and South, and start a process by which positive steps are taken to protect pollinators and the service they provide into the future.  Over the life of the Plan, the aim is to achieve conditions, on an all-island basis, where pollinators can not only survive but reverse declining populations and thrive.</p><p>The issue of declining populations of bees is also a global one and requires communication and cooperation at an international level.  Ireland &ndash; represented by officials from my Department - is a member of the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and has approved the global assessment on pollination.  Irish scientists contributed to this assessment and many of the actions in the document are reflected in the <i>All-Ireland Pollinator Plan</i>.</p></reply>

This represents a large proportion of my Department&rsquo;s overall budget and reflects the value and the commitment that my Department places on the Park.

It is the subject of a long-standing on-going programme in the National Park.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, my Department has invested over &euro;700,000 to tackle the issue in Killarney National Park and in 2016 alone the Department spent almost &euro;210,000 on clearance.  An updated Strategic Management Plan for the issue is being finalised and my Department hopes to publish this in the coming months.  My Department has an all year round student volunteer programme for site maintenance and also runs 4 (two week) VSI work camps over the summer months in this regard as well.  In addition, substantial areas are maintained and cleared under contract.</p>  <p>  In 2015, my Department appointed a specialist for a two-year period to assist the on-going eradication programme.  Having regard to the dynamic and aggressive nature of growth, the key deliverables of this contract include:</p>  <p>  -  conducting initial assessment of affected areas having regard to available resources to identify and to initiate early actions required for optimal impact;</p>  <p>  -  in consultation with and working alongside Park Management/staff to consider, propose and oversee the allocation and application of available resources to the programme and programme implementation;</p>  <p>  -  production of a five-year management strategy for its continued eradication of at various locations within Killarney National Park; </p>  <p>  -  carrying out scientific investigations with a view to developing new measures for its eradication; and</p>  <p>  -  provision of advice and support to Park management and staff in the roll-out of the initial phase/phases of a work programme to give effect to the five-year management strategy for its continued eradication at various locations within Killarney National Park.</p>  <p>  Regarding the second matter raised in "details supplied", my Department commissioned a Census Report for Killarney National Park in 2016.

I have not had bilateral engagements with counterparts from other Members States in relation to Brexit outside that context.</p>  <p>  The programme of engagement by the Government with other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force is already underway and will be intensified in 2017.  This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  An important part of our preparations for the Brexit negotiations is ensuring that our particular concerns are heard and understood across Europe and engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is therefore critical.  There is ongoing engagement with relevant parties to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns and to ensure that they are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence.  In that regard, I met with Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Vice President of the European Commission last November when Brexit was among the issues discussed.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to participate in the preparations for the negotiations which will follow the triggering of Article 50 by the United Kingdom.  For example, I am hosting a Sectoral Dialogue in Cavan on 6 February to provide an opportunity to engage with stakeholders across the broad range of policy areas for which my Department is responsible.</p></reply>

Waiting list data, compiled and published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) last week, provide evidence that the cardiology inpatient/daycase procedure waiting list at the hospital has reduced by almost 20% since the end of November, and the number of persons waiting longer than a year has reduced by some 67%.  By year end, a total of 489 patients remained on the list, with no patient waiting longer than 18 months.</p>  <p>  The focus on the UHW cardiology waiting list will continue in 2017.  The SSWHG has a robust plan in place to address the remaining backlog which involves access to cath lab capacity across the region.  In addition, as recommended in the Herity Report, an additional &euro;.5m funding has been provided to UHW, in 2017, which will enable the hospital to provide 2 additional cath lab sessions (8 hours) per week.  I am advised that patients waiting over 12 months will have their procedures completed in the first 8 weeks of 2017; patients waiting 3 &ndash; 12 months will have their procedures completed by June 2017.  It is not expected that those procedures will be delayed by other measures currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 makes specific provision for those patients waiting longest for treatment within the health service.  In this context, I am considering a national cardiology waiting list initiative which will address waiting times for cardiology treatments in a number of hospitals, including UHW.  A range of measures are envisaged including sharing of facilities and resources amongst public hospitals, use of private facilities and the deployment of a mobile cath lab.  Further details of the proposed initiative will be made available in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly regarding the number of mobile cath labs currently in use.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p>  <p>  1.  the health needs of the public; </p>  <p>  2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services; </p>  <p>  3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p>  <p>  4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks; </p>  <p>  5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p>  <p>  6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item; </p>  <p>  7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety; </p>  <p>  8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p>  <p>  9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at current price offered by the company. </p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  This process is on-going.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of this process the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee will make a recommendation on the cost-effectiveness of Orkambi to the HSE Directorate for a decision, taking into consideration the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  Again, this decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds in line with the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  I fully support the HSE in its efforts to reduce the price of this medicine and I would call on all public representatives, including the members of this house, to do the same.</p></reply>

The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to advise on this issue.  In particular, I have requested that the HPRA provide advice on recent developments in the use of cannabis for medical purposes including an overview of products that have been authorised in other countries and an overview of the wider on-going and emerging clinical research in new indications and evidence of efficacy.  I have also requested information on the different regulatory regimes in place in countries which allow cannabis to be used for medicinal purposes.</p>  <p>  I expect to receive an initial report from the HPRA by the end of January.  I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be appropriate.</p></reply>

There is a risk that H5N8 could spread to poultry or other birds here in Ireland mainly as a result of the movement of wild migratory birds. </p>  <p>  On the 23 December last, my Department announced regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 requiring flock keepers to confine all poultry and captive birds in their possession or under their control in a secure building to which wild birds, or other animals do not have access, and to apply specific bio-security measures.  This followed the confirmation of H5N8 in a wild bird in Wales, and is the first time such action has been taken by this Department.  The requirement to keep birds confined remains in place until further notice but it will be kept under review.  It is likely that this will be for a maximum of 12 weeks, in order to prevent any impact on the marketing status for free-range and organic reared poultry.</p>  <p>  Bird gatherings (shows, exhibitions and races) are permitted under general licence, subject to prior notification and certain bio security conditions. </p>  <p>  Subsequent to the confirmation of avian influenza subtype H5N8 in wild birds in Wexford last December, the disease has been confirmed in wild birds in Galway and in Tipperary earlier this month.  These cases serve to confirm that infection in wild birds is likely well established in Ireland and that poultry flocks across the country are at risk from introduction of the virus.  With this developing knowledge, I would re-emphasise the requirement to confine poultry and other birds, and to apply strict bio-security measures to prevent the introduction of avian influenza.  Poultry flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that although the H5N8 subtype can cause serious disease in poultry and other birds, no human infections with this virus have been reported world-wide and therefore risk to humans is considered to be very low.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to review all aspects of its contingency arrangements in light of any emerging veterinary or scientific information and will take measures that are considered appropriate, if necessary.</p></reply>

It follows on from two highly successful initiatives, namely the Burren LIFE Project 2005-2010 and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme, 2010-2015.  However, the new Burren Programme differs from its predecessors in two ways: it will be much bigger, with triple the previous participation levels, and it will offer five-year contracts, rather than operating from year-to-year as was previously the case.  </p>  <p>  The transformation of the previous annual schemes into this much larger five-year Programme has required extensive negotiation with the EU Commission along with detailed design and development work.  As part of this process, my Department is developing a new online land-management system for the Burren.  Some components of this have yet to be completed, which means that one stream of the Burren Programme - the capital investment stream - has not yet been activated.  However, this will not in any way affect farmers' access to funding under the new Programme: payments are linked to the area of Annex 1 habitat held by each farmer and this provides for an individual 'envelope' of funds for each farmer that they can use anytime over the duration of their five year contract.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that the new online land management system will  be available shortly for testing.  Once this has been completed, and all parties involved with the testing are satisfied, the system will be released. In the meantime, payments for the main intervention under the new Programme, which is the management of grazed habitats, is continuing as normal.  Payments under this intervention have already commenced for the first tranche of farmers who entered the scheme in 2016.  Payment to those entering in 2017 commence towards the end of this year, as is normal with schemes of this nature. </p></reply>

This EU funding will be supplemented by Exchequer funding, bringing the total allocation to some &euro;4 billion.  The annual breakdown of total EU support under the Rural Development Programme for Ireland is set out in annex 1 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 &ndash; see table 1.</p><p>If the amount of EAFRD expenditure drawn down in a calendar year is less than the annual breakdown, the difference between the actual EAFRD expenditure and the annual breakdown may be reviewed without changing the overall EAFRD allocation for the period.  Essentially, any unspent EAFRD funds in a year are carried forward to subsequent years.  The overall amount of &euro;2.19 billion EAFRD funding will be spent over the 7-year programme period.</p><p>The annual breakdown of total EU support is only made at aggregate level and is not transferred down to measure/sub-measure level (or scheme level).  The RDP Regulation is structured according to measures while for the purpose of financial management of national expenditures, we run and implement the RDP measures as schemes.  These schemes may extend over more than one RDP measure - for example, the BDGP scheme draws funding from measure 1 and measure 10.  At the same time, one RDP measure may contribute funds to a number of schemes - for example, measure 1 contributes to Knowledge Transfer and M10 GLAS/BDGP training.</p><p>The financial allocations for the RDP 2014-2020 measures and sub-measure are set out in table 2.  Please note the horticultural sector is not included in the RDP 2014-2020.  In addition, please note the financial allocations for the new measures/sub-measures (support for Beef Producer Organisations, Sheep Welfare Scheme and the European Innovation Partnerships including the Locally Led schemes) being introduced as part of the 2nd amendment to the RDP are subject to formal approval by the European Commission.  </p><p>In contrast to the RDP, annual allocations to each Vote are a key feature of our national exchequer system and these allocations are sub-divided into sub-head allocations.  Table 3 in the attached shows the annual allocations for 2014, 2015 (original and after the supplementary Estimate), 2016 and 2017 to the sub-heads covering the schemes you referred to in your question which are funded under the 2014-2020 RDP.

The "Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme" was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  It will provide farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  The SBCI is aiming to bring the loans to market by the end of January and I hope to make an announcement in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  This innovative loan Scheme will make &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  This is supported by &euro;25 million being provided by my Department, including &euro;11 million in EU exceptional adjustment aid. In order to comply with requirements attached to the EU element of funding, it is envisaged that the Scheme will be available until late summer 2017.  However there is considerable interest in the Scheme and the loans will be dispersed on a "first come, first served" basis.  I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now, and if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-01-19a.734.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017011900072#WRR03400"><p>Bord Bia's recent report estimated that the value of Irish agri-food and drink exports exceeded &euro;11 billion for the first time in 2016 despite challenging international conditions.  This is the seventh consecutive year of growth. Bord Bia estimated the potential impact on the value of agri-food exports to the UK last year arising from Brexit at around &euro;570m, based on the value of sterling falling by 13% relative to the euro in 2016.  In fact, exports to the UK  fell  by &euro;360 million (-8%) to &euro;4.1 billion.  By contrast, exports to other EU markets grew by 3%; while exports to international markets grew by 13%, driven by strong growth in the Chinese and US markets in particular.  Overall the value of exports grew by 2% to &euro;11.15 billion.</p>  <p>  While Brexit is a significant new factor, Ireland, as a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its food production, has always been exposed to international market volatility.  We have seen significant commodity price volatility on world markets over the last few years.  However, my Department has ensured that measures are in place to help alleviate the pressures of income volatility:</p>  <p>  - Direct payments, estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;17,000 per farm, provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility.</p>  <p>  - The adjustment in Budget 2017 to the income averaging scheme for tax purposes will allow farmers to avail of an opt-out in an exceptional year.</p>  <p>  - The 'Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme', developed by my Department in cooperation with the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), will make &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at low-cost interest rates of 2.95%.  This is supported by &euro;25 million being provided by my Department, including &euro;11 million in EU aid.  The SBCI is aiming to make these loans available by the end of January and I hope to make an announcement in relation to this shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition I have made provision for additional funding to Bord Bia both for 2016 and 2017 to address the situation. Indeed the agencies have been active in their response.</p>  <p>  - Bord Bia has activated a 4-pillar support strategy for Irish food companies to maintain growth in this period of volatility and over the longer term.  These activities are captured under the headings of Managing Volatility, Obtaining Consumer and Market Insight, Deepening Customer Engagement and Extending Market Reach.</p>  <p>  - Enterprise Ireland's initial, industry-wide, 5-point plan included provision of information (on improving competitiveness, reducing supply chain costs through the provision of LEAN and R&amp;D/Innovation supports to clients, and accessing funding), market development support and UK market support.</p>  <p>  - Both agencies have also been working with individual companies in order to tailor the response in accordance with the particular difficulties being faced, and have been working together on strategic marketing initiatives.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of the Brexit referendum I established within my Department a task force who have engaged and will continue to engage, with stakeholders both within Government Departments and the agri food sector to support and protect our valuable food and drink export industry.  </p>  <p>  In light of the UK vote to leave the EU, Brexit has been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee for Food Wise, which I chair.  It is clear that driving the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision.</p></reply>

An important part of our preparations for the Brexit negotiations is ensuring that our particular concerns are heard and understood across Europe, and engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is therefore critical.  Accordingly, an extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission's Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way.  This engagement is being intensified in 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition to the meetings that I have had over recent months with my counterparts Michelle McIlveen and Andrea Leadsom, in Belfast and in London, I have raised Ireland's agri-food concerns arising from Brexit with a range of EU counterparts.  This has taken place not only in the margins of Council of Ministers meetings, but also in the context of other Ministerial gatherings such as that in Chambord, France, last September and the regular European People's Party meetings in Brussels, where I have had the opportunity to raise our concerns with Member States such as Germany, France, Poland, Denmark, Belgium, Spain and Hungary.  I will be meeting Secretary of State Andrea Leadsom at Berlin Green Week  over the weekend and several of my EU counterparts at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels next Monday.</p>  <p>  Senior officials of my Department have also been meeting with counterparts from other Member States such as Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, and with forthcoming EU Presidencies, with a view to deepening our engagement on this issue and preparing formal meetings at Ministerial level, which will intensify in the coming months in order to ensure Ireland's concerns are fully reflected in the EU position once negotiations commence. </p>  <p>  Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team, and we look forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i></i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map currently indicates that 100% of the townlands of Kilmainham Headfort and Kilmainham (Ed Kells rural) falls within an AMBER area and will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.  Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The Department will also shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised and potential other new investments. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report  which was published in December, is available at the following link: .</p><p>I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band in early 2017. This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. </p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Meath.</p></reply>

The choice of heat emitters within a home i.e. radiators, under floor or other method, was up to the individual homeowner and was not grant supported.  Therefore, I am not aware of any grants previously offered by my Department or the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) towards the installation of under floor heating.</p>  <p>  Through SEAI, my Department continues to offer a range of grants to householders under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.  These grants concentrate on the upgrade of the energy efficiency of a home.  By upgrading the energy efficiency of a home a householder needs to use less energy to achieve their desired level of comfort and warmth regardless of heating type.  This lowers energy bills for the householder and reduces Ireland's carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  Within the Better Energy Homes scheme, a grant of &euro;700 is made available to people who wish to upgrade their oil or gas boiler together with heating controls.  This grant is made available to incentivise householders to replace an ageing boiler with a newer, more efficient model and requires that the householder installs heating controls.  I have asked SEAI to conduct a review of the technologies that are currently supported through the Better Energy Homes scheme and consider whether grant support should be offered for a wider range of energy upgrades.  I expect SEAI to report back to me later this year. Any changes to the scheme that are warranted will be operational in 2018.</p></reply>

I recently met with the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA).  I have also met with the Association for Tyre Retails Standards (ATRS).  I listened to the concerns of the ITIA and the ITWRA and I have done my best to address as many of them as possible.  I have also received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place with the industry for the introduction of the scheme from other operators in the tyre market.  One area of concern to the industry is the issue of market distortion and in this regard, distance sellers, i.e. those placing tyres on the Irish market but located outside the State, will have the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland.  In addition tyres will be a priority area for enforcement in 2017 for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) and I will be asking them to give particular attention to the border regions.</p>  <p>  Elements of the tyre industry also contend that the formalisation of the existing charge which consumers pay when purchasing new tyre will cause a distortion in the market, with non-compliant operators undercutting compliant ones.  I do not accept this.  The regulations I am introducing will formalise this fee and ensure that it is used correctly to support the sound environmental treatment of waste tyres.  As things stand, the consumer pays on the double &ndash; first, when they purchase new tyres and then again, through their taxation when local authorities have to remove illegal tyre stockpiles across the country. </p>  <p>  The Compliance Scheme will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited.  The scheme will carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members.  All operators will be obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the market.  This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard.  It will be mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.</p>  <p>  I am convinced that the new structures will address the lack of regulation in this market to date and address the occurrences of stockpiles of waste tyres that could have a detrimental effect on the environment and human health.</p></reply>

This element has already seen IFI exit expensive property leases and move to new HQ facilities with significantly better energy efficiency, consistent with Government commitments as regards reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption.  The exit from expensive leases and improved building efficiencies are expected to generate significant financial savings.  From an operational perspective the inventory of IFI properties will facilitate consideration of broader rationalisation proposals in regional areas.</p><p>IFI have, thus far, developed an inventory of its property and intends to set out proposals on facility rationalisation within River Basin Districts (RBDs) to augment operational and deployment efficiencies.  IFI does not currently have a base in Athlone and no consideration has yet been given to base locations in the Shannon RBD.  In that regard, I would be happy to ask IFI to keep the Deputy advised of developments, however, at this stage, the position asserted by the Deputy is premature.</p><p>IFI advise that the geographical management structure for Inland Fisheries has long been based on River Basin Districts (RBD) rather than Counties.  In delivering its core functions, IFI adapts development, protection and environmental / conservation practices to maximise the return on state investment in policing, conserving and developing the resource.  IFI adopts a wide-ranging protection strategy and delivers an associated broad protection programme across the entire Shannon RBD.</p><p>Based on this model of protection, IFI&rsquo;s aim in property rationalisation proposals will seek to augment the critical scale of bases and response and deployment capability in the changing and developing circumstances and environment in which services are delivered.  It is also intended to continue to develop best value for public funds in service delivery.</p><p>The IFI offices in Ballinlough and Roscommon are resources within the Shannon RBD which assist in covering a significant catchment from Westmeath, East Galway, Roscommon and Longford.  These operate effectively with a compliment of 4 Officers, reporting to a locally based Inspector.</p><p>IFI has input a significant protection and development resource into this catchment including day and night surveillance operations, boat, kayak and foot patrols, monitoring of water quality and planning developments, survey work, infrastructural projects and promotional assistance including the recently launched production &ldquo;<i>Along by the River: Discover the River Suck</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>Protection and other works are carried out on an RBD-wide basis and Officers stationed in other catchments of the Shannon RBD have participated in protection actions in the Roscommon area.  In 2016, in excess of 5,000 person hours were provided to patrols and a further 193 person hours in assistance during the emergency flooding events, more than 100 boat patrols, 300 vehicle patrols resulting in over 3,000 angler inspections, seizures of nets and five prosecutions initiated.  38 rivers were assessed for development and five major angling development projects commenced.</p><p>I am also advised that the Midlands Fisheries Fund scheme has resulted in development projects in the Castlecoote, Donamon, Lough Acalla, Lough Loung, Blacks Lough and River Suck areas since 2013.  IFI were also a partner in the biodiversity looped walk project on Lough O&rsquo;Flynn and contributes towards fish stocking.</p><p>These catchments have been and will remain a high priority for IFI who will continue to protect, develop, conserve, manage and promote the fisheries to benefit the angling resource and local communities.</p></reply>

Scientific understanding has evolved in the intervening years, however, and numerous studies now indicate that air pollution, at lower levels than was previously understood, has impacts on human health.  Consequently, it is necessary to continue to strengthen policy to enhance air quality for the protection of people&rsquo;s health and the environment.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I am committed to extending the smoky coal ban nationwide.  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Departments and agencies, the residential fuel industry, and the general public.  Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban have already taken place with some of these stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the first ever national Clean Air Strategy which will provide the strategic framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions and improve our air quality.  The strategy will also impact a wide range of other national policies that are relevant to air quality, such as transport, energy and agriculture.  The issue of promoting alternative fuels is a key feature of the strategy and a consultation process on the strategy will commence shortly.  I would expect that the strategy will be published by the end of 2017 and will, inter alia, indicate a timeline for the nationwide extension of the ban on smoky coal.</p></reply>

Budget 2017 provided for a &euro;2.19 million increase in funding for the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) this year, which is part of the overall increase of &euro;31 million for public transport services in the Budget.  The increase in RTP funding brings the total allocated to the Programme in 2017 to &euro;14.396 million.  The increased level of funding for the RTP will enable a continuation of the process already underway of making improvements to existing services and developing new routes.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for the Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of LIS.  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  While 2017 will see a modest increase in funding for roads, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus will have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  I do, however, expect that local authorities will continue to be able to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Local Improvement Schemes, I will be raising the issue of increased funding in the context of the planned Review of the Capital Plan.  I expect to announce the 2017 regional and local road allocations in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

There are reports of large increases for existing policy holders and difficulties in obtaining insurance for new operators.  The implications of the current insurance difficulties faced by those in the taxi sector are of concern to me and the Government.  These difficulties being experienced by taxi and hackney operators were highlighted by my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) to the Working Group established last year, by the Minister for Finance, to review the factors which are influencing the increase in cost of motor insurance.  I am advised that the NTA also had a bi-lateral meeting with the Department of Finance to apprise them of the situation pertaining to small public service vehicle (SPSV) licence holders in relation to both the availability and cost of SPSV insurance.  The Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan TD and Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD published the Working Group's Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance on 10 January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions and  contains a detailed Action Plan identifying the responsible bodies and the timelines for delivery of the recommendations.</p>  <p>  The Report states that while neither the Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct insurance companies as to how they price their products, the Working Group believes that the implementation of the Report's recommendations will lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and will help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past (both up and down) and should also better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the appropriate bodies, will work towards implementing the relevant Recommendations in the Report.</p></reply>

The Company is currently loss-making and these losses are not sustainable.  The Deputy may recall that a few months ago, the Chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann announced that the Board had commissioned a firm of consultants, Grant Thornton, to review proposals for Bus &Eacute;ireann which the company's management had drawn up, and to advise the Board on those proposals.  Last week I met the Chair of the Company who briefed me on the report that had been presented to the Board by the consultants a few days previously.  It seems that an early version of that report - but not the version that was presented to the Board last week - was reported upon in the media last week. It is important to note that the Grant Thornton report is an analysis prepared as advice for a Board which reviews some options, provides a critique of them and makes suggestions for further areas to consider; the report is not a plan in itself, and it was not intended that it would be a plan.  On foot of the report and the Board's deliberations, the Company is now engaged in preparing a plan for its future and will be developing and finalising this over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Chairman updated me on the very serious situation the Company faces and assured me that the Board is resolved to address the situation and to restore the company to a sustainable position.  The Chair indicated that an invitation would issue shortly to trade unions to commence discussions on proposals.  I am firmly of the belief that difficult issues such as this can only be resolved through open, constructive and realistic engagement between the company and its employees and I encourage both sides to engage constructively on the matter. </p>  <p>  Separately to my meeting with the Company Chair, I also met with the National Transport Authority who outlined to me their powers and responsibilities in relation to the provision of public transport services.  I was assured by the NTA that it will work with local communities to maintain an appropriate level of public transport connectivity in the event of any reconfiguration of existing services.</p></reply>

Irrespective of that, I have previously stated that accurately benchmarking the level of subsidy paid to transport operators can be a difficult task given the very different services which operators provide.  The amount of subsidy provided is reflective of the operator's contractual responsibilities under their public service contracts with the National Transport Authority, which since 2010 is statutorily responsible for the allocation of subsidies to individual transport operators.

In making the decision to proceed with new Metro North, the Government asked the NTA to keep the interim public transport needs of the corridor under review.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the NTA's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, which was adopted subsequent to publication of the Capital Plan states at Section 5.5.4:</p>  <p>  "In addition, on the Swords/Airport to City Centre corridor, it will be necessary to provide a higher level of public transport capacity than the existing provision, both in advance of new Metro North and also to serve areas south of the M50 subsequent to the implementation of new Metro North.  This additional capacity will take the form of a BRT service or a BRT type service or a conventional bus corridor upgrade along this route or parts of this route.  The exact arrangements to be implemented will be determined in conjunction with the development arrangements for new Metro North, and will be designed to be complementary to the new Metro North proposal.  Accordingly, a BRT scheme is included for development along the Swords/Airport to City Centre corridor, but its extent may be reduced or it may be modified to a conventional bus corridor upgrade, in conjunction with the development of the new Metro North project."</p>  <p>  I am informed by the NTA that there is not an embargo on road improvements along the route of the draft Swords/Airport to City Centre BRT corridor.  However, the NTA has requested that Dublin City Council ensure that such improvements are compatible with the developed design of this BRT scheme in order to remove the potential for works to be constructed which would have to be reconstructed for the BRT scheme, should it proceed.</p>  <p>  With regard to expenditure on BRT projects to date in 2017, I have referred your question to the NTA for reply.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

This activity is reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  The Government is acutely aware of the potential risks and challenges for the Irish economy and will remain fully engaged on this aspect as the negotiations proceed.  An important part of our preparations for the Brexit negotiations is ensuring that our particular concerns are heard and understood across Europe, and engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is therefore critical.</p>  <p>  Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team and looks forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.</p>  <p>  There will be no negotiations with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.</p></reply>

Generally, public bodies are allowed to grant aid to a single undertaking of up to &euro;200,000 over a 3 year fiscal period without prior notification or approval from DG Competition.  The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Specific arrangements on de minimis aid apply in the following sectors:</p>  <p>  road freight transport sector - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;100,000 to any industrial road freight transport operator over any consecutive three year fiscal period</p>  <p>  primary production of agricultural products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;15,000 to any agricultural producer over any consecutive three year fiscal period and an overall cap for Ireland in any 3 year period of &euro;66,280,000.</p>  <p>  production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;30,000 for any producer, processor or marketer of fishery or agriculture products  and an overall cap for Ireland of &euro;20,820,000.</p>  <p>  As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the de minimis threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the de minimis threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.  A more modest increase to &euro;300,000 was also declined.  The current State Aid framework does not allow for the re-calibration of aid intensity rates under the GBER or de minimis thresholds.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the UK vote to leave the EU, my Department has initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules.  Discussions will continue in 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to supports for export finance I would direct the Deputy to the Minister for Finance recent announcement that his Department, with the support of my Department, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Enterprise Ireland (EI), is working on developing and rolling out an Integrated Export Finance Strategy.  In this regard, work is continuing on the delivery of an export finance pilot initiative, due to be delivered by Q2 2017.</p></reply>

It will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit an additional forty to fifty staff to supplement existing staffing numbers.  In this regard, the additional &euro;3 million pay allocation is for distribution across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  This will also be utilised to support the dedicated Brexit Unit within my Department, with a staffing resource, led at Principal Officer level, of four staff; this will be reviewed in line with the necessary workload as matters develop.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to be specific at this time on the distribution of the additional posts across my Department and each State Agency in 2017 as staffing resources are reviewed as an ongoing priority to ensure my Department&rsquo;s continued ability to facilitate the wide mission and volume of work in a range of challenging policy areas.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis in workforce planning within the context of allocated funding, and with reallocation of staff across my Department as the needs of business units evolve.  This will continue during 2017 with ongoing regular reviews of the appropriate staffing across my Department in response to emerging priorities.  I might also mention that my Department entered 2017 with a number of vacancies to be filled through recruitment in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service and/or advertising certain posts across the Civil Service to be filled under the Civil Service mobility programme.  Furthermore, the Department is frequently below its minimum staffing levels as we work to fill vacancies created by normal levels of staff turnover.  Therefore, it is difficult to be precise as to how staffing levels will move during the year.  Nonetheless, I can inform the Deputy that staffing levels are closely monitored to ensure that we remain within pay-budget limits agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform having regard to key priorities and our workforce planning exercise. </p>  <p>  Each Agency is provided with an overall Pay ceiling within which they have some flexibility to align their staffing resources to manage their overall operations and priorities.  In addition some Agencies also have Own Resource Income which they may wish to utilise to support their particular priority areas, be that to cover operational Pay costs or some Non-Pay costs, such as running promotional and awareness campaigns, to be agreed with my Department.  As with the Department itself, responding to individual key strategic priorities and individual workforce planning exercises, each Agency works with my Department to ensure each remains within agreed pay-budget limits.</p></reply>

I am informed by the WRC that 84% of complaints received between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2016 were made by way of the online e-Complaint facility. </p>  <p>  The WRCs online complaints system is fundamental to the reform process and the efficient delivery of services.  The Deputy will be aware that under the previous system complainants could face a two-to-three year delay in obtaining a decision. At present, decisions are issued on average within 6 months of their receipt by the WRC.  Under the WRCs Strategic Plan, the intention is to shorten this time-frame even further. </p>  <p>  The WRC has addressed many of the teething problems associated with the IT system during its first year of existence and has met with key stakeholders to listen to their concerns in this regard.

Generally, public bodies are allowed to grant aid to a single undertaking of up to &euro;200,000 over a 3 year fiscal period without prior notification or approval from DG Competition.  The Regulation requires that the aid is &lsquo;transparent&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Specific arrangements on de minimis aid apply in the following sectors:</p>  <p>  -  road freight transport sector - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;100,000 to any industrial road freight transport operator over any consecutive three year fiscal period</p>  <p>  -  primary production of agricultural products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;15,000 to any agricultural producer over any consecutive three year fiscal period and an overall cap for Ireland in any 3 year period of &euro;66,280,000.</p>  <p>  -  production, processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products - the de minimis ceiling is &euro;30,000 for any producer, processor or marketer of fishery or agriculture products and an overall cap for Ireland of &euro;20,820,000.</p>  <p>  As part of the revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) under the State Aid Modernisation Agenda, Member States and the Commission discussed a proposal to increase the de minimis threshold in 2013.  A number of Member States suggested increasing the de minimis threshold to &euro;500,000 over a three year fiscal period.  The European Commission rejected the proposal on the basis that the amount was substantial and could distort the competition in the Internal Market.  A more modest increase to &euro;300,000 was also declined.  The current State Aid framework does not allow for the re-calibration of aid intensity rates under the GBER or de minimis thresholds. </p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the UK vote to leave the EU, my Department has initiated engagement with senior officials from the DG Competition to ensure Ireland can deliver the necessary supports to Irish enterprises within the EU State Aid rules. Discussions will continue in 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to supports for export finance I would direct the Deputy to the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s recent announcement that his Department, with the support of my Department, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Enterprise Ireland (EI), is working on developing and rolling out an Integrated Export Finance Strategy.  In this regard, work is continuing on the delivery of an export finance pilot initiative, due to be delivered by Q2 2017. </p></reply>

I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, at 30 November 2016, was 9,147, comprising 7,381 Army, 708 Air Corps and 1,058 Naval Service.  These figures exclude 74 personnel who are on secondment/career break. </p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.</p>  <p>  It is intended that this targeted recruitment will continue during 2017, from the recruitment panels formed from the current General Service recruitment competition, launched in April 2016, until they are exhausted.  Plans are being put in place to run a new General Service recruitment competition for the Army and for the Naval Service in the first quarter of 2017.  Details of these competitions and application forms will be available on the Defence Forces website www.military.ie when the competitions commence.  Applications for each competition will also be accepted via the Defence Forces Facebook page.</p>  <p>  The intake of Cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to Defence.  It is planned to launch the 2017 Cadetship competitions in the first quarter of 2017. </p>  <p>  Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.  In this regard it is proposed to launch an Air Corps Apprentice Aircraft Technician competition during 2017. </p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

The Naval College is the sole Naval Service training authority.  It ensures quality assurance in regard to the maintenance of the required training standard for both PDF and RDF personnel who, on completion of training, may deploy across a range of sea-going or shore units throughout their careers.  In this regard the Naval College provides a centre of excellence for training and allows concentration of recruits into viable class sizes. </p></reply>
