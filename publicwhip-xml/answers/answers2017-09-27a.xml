During our meeting we discussed the provisional implementation of CETA which commenced on September 21.  We discussed the latest developments on Brexit and Ireland's priorities in the negotiations.  Prime Minister Trudeau updated me on the latest state of play with regards to the NAFTA negotiations. In the context of a wider conversation on healthcare, I updated the Prime Minister on plans to hold a constitutional referendum on the Eighth Amendment.

Arts and Heritage are covered under the fourth pillar of the plan - Fostering Culture and Creativity in Rural Communities.  The key objectives of this Pillar are to:</p>  <p>  - Increase access to the arts and enhance cultural facilities in rural communities.</p>  <p>  - Further develop and enhance culture and creativity in rural Ireland through the establishment of culture teams and creativity hubs as part of the Creative Ireland      Programme.</p>  <p>  - Promote the Irish language as a key resource in Gaeltacht and other rural communities.</p>  <p>  Of the 275 actions in the Action Plan many relate to our natural and built heritage assets.  These assets are an essential part of the fabric of rural Ireland and their promotion in the context of the future growth of the rural economy is essential.  As is their contribution to local pride of place and wellness.  In that respect, my Department is continuing to work closely with the Department of Rural and Community Development.  A rural proofing has been inbuilt to all our heritage promotion programmes and initiatives.</p>  <p>  These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector. </p>  <p>  In February this year I announced details of more than &euro;9 million in capital funding for existing dedicated arts and culture centres across the country.  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 is the most significant investment in arts and cultural centres in a decade and will target investment at a range of different facilities, including arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, as well as artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. </p>  <p>  In August I announced further capital funding of almost &euro;750,000 for more than 60 arts organisations around the country.  The funding is being made available under Stream 3 of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018.  It was geared towards providing capital grants of up to &euro;20,000 to not-for-profit organisations with a defined arts and cultural remit. </p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 is flexible to ensure that a diverse number of arts organisations would benefit.  As a result of the latest round of funding, more than 120 organisations in total have benefitted from this very worthwhile scheme.</p>  <p>  A full list of successful projects under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 (Streams 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3) is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-09-27a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017092700069#WRA02800"><p>The control of live hare coursing, including the operation of individual coursing meetings and managing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. My responsibility relates to the conservation status of the hare.</p>  <p>  In August this year, my Department issued licences under the Wildlife Acts to the Irish Coursing Club, covering its affiliated coursing clubs, to capture and tag hares for use at regulated hare coursing meetings for the 2017/18 coursing season, which extends from the end of September 2017 to the end of February 2018.  </p>  <p>  There are 22 conditions associated with the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club which have been developed and refined over the year.  One of the conditions requires that hares must be released back into the wild during daylight hours after the coursing has concluded unless otherwise agreed, in advance, with the relevant National Parks and Wildlife Service officials.</p>  <p>  It is also a condition of the licence that in all matters relating to coursing there must be full compliance with the Directives, Instructions and Guidance Notes issued by the Irish Coursing Club.  One of the provisions of the Irish Coursing Club in that regard is that hares earmarked and released may not be taken up and coursed at any subsequent park meeting.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while there may be a possibility that a released hare could be recaptured for a future coursing meeting, the conditions require that that hare should not be coursed again.  The conditions of future licenses issued by my Department in respect of coursing meetings will be kept under review in light of any issues brought to my attention by National Parks and Wildlife officials or by others and I will make any changes that I consider appropriate.</p></reply>

The pilot initiative, which will be reviewed after one year, applies to visual artists and writers.

This includes the Curlew, which has declined by 97% in Ireland since the late 1980s and needs substantial effort if it is to be saved from extinction as a breeding species here.  Research has shown that one of the key reasons for the declines of Curlew and other ground-nesting birds is excessive predation rates, including by members of the crow family, in particular Grey Crows and Magpies.  It is estimated that there are more than half a million of both species in Ireland, and that their population is artificially high.  They are both difficult species to control effectively.</p>  <p>  Magpies and Grey Crows are controlled, in a managed and localised way, by professional operatives on contract to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to help rare and threatened species rear their young.  Larsen traps are used as part of this effort.</p>  <p>  The use of Larsen traps is permitted in Ireland subject to compliance with the Wildlife Acts (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations 2003, and Section 35(5) of the Wildlife Acts. </p>  <p>  The Wild Bird Declarations which I signed in April of this year and which run to May of 2018 makes it lawful to hunt Grey Crows and Magpies with cage traps (including Larsen traps) once the conditions set out in the declarations are met during the periods and for the reasons set out in the declarations.</p></reply>

Our 6 National Parks account for circa 60,000 hectares with another almost 20,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. </p>  <p>  While the existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, it is also recognised that they are &lsquo;core assets&rsquo; which play a very important role in Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to improving our tourism product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable tourism potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives. </p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole at a cost of &euro;800,000.  The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;&iacute;lte Ireland, launched a strategic investment partnership earlier this year with the aim of developing tourism projects and improving visitor experience at our National Parks.</p></reply>

This study found that schools are important arenas for access to arts/culture and school emphasis on culture has a positive impact on student engagement in these activities.</p><p>This year the Arts Council increased funding in this area from &euro;3.1m in 2016 to &euro;3.7m in 2017 on foot of the significant increase of support of &euro;5m which I secured for the Arts Council as part of Budget 2017.  I also provided an additional &euro;70,000 to the Arts Council to assist in the expansion of the Teacher Artist Partnership this year. </p><p>In terms of next steps, my Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Youth and Children Affairs and the Arts Council in preparing the <i>Creative Children</i>plan to deliver the objectives of Pillar 1 of the Creative Ireland Programme.

This includes the Curlew, which has declined by 97% in Ireland since the late 1980s and needs substantial effort if it is to be saved from extinction as a breeding species here.  One of the main reasons for the declines of Curlew and other ground-nesting birds is excessive predation rates, including by members of the crow family, in particular Grey Crows and Magpies.  It is estimated that there are more than half a million of both species in Ireland, and that their population is artificially high.  </p>  <p>  As part of the conservation work carried out by my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service, Magpies and Grey Crows are legally and humanely controlled, in a managed and localised way, to help protect rare and threatened species and to help them to rear their young.  Larsen traps are used as part of this effort for Curlew, Red-throated Diver, Red Grouse, Lapwing, Redshank, Snipe, Corncrake and other species where predation is judged to be a significant factor in their decline.  Traps can be used throughout the year, as appropriate, in response to threats to vulnerable ground-nesting species.</p>  <p>  The use of Larsen Traps complies with the provisions of the Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations 2003 (SI No. 620/2003).  </p></reply>

Monaghan and Middletown in Co. Armagh along the route of the Ulster Canal.  The project is funded by the INTERREG VA programme and will be one of the first cross-border Greenways in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Blueways have been successfully in operation on the Shannon since October 2014 linking Drumshanbo with Carrick-on-Shannon.  Waterways Ireland recently opened an iconic Blueways Boardwalk on Acres Lake at Drumshanbo which is already attracting large volumes of users.  The Shannon-Erne Blueway was opened in May 2016 linking Leitrim Village with Belturbet, Co Cavan, providing 70km of paddling journeys, 25km of walking trails and 8 km of cycling.  Waterways Ireland, in conjunction with Local Authorities and other partners, are continuing to extend the Blueways offering on the Shannon and Shannon-Erne. </p>  <p>  On the Barrow navigation, Waterways Ireland have submitted planning proposals to upgrade the Barrow towpath.  This will provide a 112km trail from Lowtown in Co. Kildare to St Mullins in Co Carlow.  </p>  <p>  Work on developing the Royal Canal towpath as a walking and cycling destination is expected to be completed by December 2018 when the 145km route can be marketed as one of the largest Greenways/Blueways in Europe. </p>  <p>  On the Grand Canal 21km of towpath has been upgraded with a further 110km yet to be completed.  Waterways Ireland are again working with Local Authorities, Leader Groups, the National Transport Authority and the National Trails Office to ensure planning and funding are progressed to upgrade all of the Grand Canal towpath.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the development of greenways and blueways presents valuable opportunities for rural communities to attract more visitors.  Their value lies not only in the recreational opportunities that they offer but also in their potential to stimulate local businesses and regenerate local areas. Greenways and blueways  also provide an effective model for partnership between the private, community and voluntary sectors and relevant State bodies.</p></reply>

This consultant will also interface as and when necessary with the Government, and the local trade and representative organisations &ndash; including the EU representative office.</p><p>Typically, Enterprise Ireland Executives also visit the market once a quarter to meet contacts in government and to meet private sector organizations to maintain awareness of Ireland as a source of world class products and services.  The current arrangements have proved to be effective and efficient for Enterprise Ireland clients as the level of client company interest in Taiwan does not warrant any higher level of in-market support at this time.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland will continue to make regular market visits in Taiwan in support of client companies which are growing exports and creating and sustaining employment in Ireland.</p></reply>

This compares to Category A (passenger) vehicles which are charged at rates between 14% and 36% of their OMSP depending on the level of CO<sub>2 </sub>they emit.  Motor homes also receive preferential treatment vis-&agrave;-vis Category A vehicles in relation to the application of annual motor tax.  </p><p>There are a number of objectives of the Irish Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system. VRT is an important source of revenue for the State.  It also seeks to reflect the negative externalities caused by using the vehicle in the State.  These externalities are the costs to society and to the environment that, without the tax, would not otherwise be reflected in the price of the vehicle and for which the consumer would not otherwise have to pay.  </p><p>In the case of motor vehicles, these include environment externalities such as air pollution, which is why one of the bases for imposing VRT is the vehicle's carbon emissions.  Other externalities which VRT seeks to reflect, include the costs to society of providing and maintaining the road infrastructure, traffic control, relevant emergency services, and vehicle registration and licensing.  The funds raised through VRT go towards compensating the Irish State for these significant costs.</p></reply>

Speech and Language Therapy services are provided to these classes by the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of additional special classes in various geographical areas, where a need has been identified.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support and applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE.  Applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE.  </p><p>The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD are set out in my Department's Circular 0038/2007.  A full-time teacher is assigned to each class, and classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1.  A minimum number of five eligible pupils is required for a school to retain a SSLD class.  Eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes.  An enhanced capitation grant is provided to schools operating special classes for pupils with SSLD.  In general, children who meet the criteria for enrolment in Special Classes for pupils with SSLD are eligible for free transport to the SSLD class nearest to his or her place of residence, subject to the terms of the school transport scheme.  </p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.  The opening of a Speech and Language class is, however, contingent on the HSE being in a position to provide Speech and Language therapy to the students in the class.</p><p>The Report of the Special Education Review Committee, also known as the SERC Report, provides the basis on which my Department sets the criteria for special education supports for children with special educational needs including children with specific speech and language disorder (SSLD).  It is stated in the SERC Report that &lsquo;  <i>Pupils with specific speech and language disorders are those whose non-verbal ability is in the average range band or higher and whose skill in understanding or expressing themselves through the medium of spoken language is severely impaired.  Their disability is not attributable, however, to factors such as defective hearing, emotional or behavioural disorders or a physical condition.  The disorders may involve difficulty with one or more of the main components of communication through spoken language, receptive and/or expressive, such as the patterning and production of speech sounds, the message content, the syntax and grammar, or the use of speech in interacting with other people.&rsquo;  </i></p><p>The criteria for specific speech and language disorder are set out in my Department in Circulars 08/99, 08/02 and 02/05 and these criteria are consistent with the recommendations in the SERC Report.  Appendix 1 of Circular 02/05 Organisation of Teaching Resources for Pupils who need additional Support in Mainstream Primary Schools states the following in relation to specific speech and language disorder:</p><p><i>- Such pupils should meet each of the following criteria:</i></p><p><i>- The pupil has been assessed by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence that places non-verbal or performance ability within the average range or above.</i></p><p><i>- The pupil has been assessed by a speech therapist on a standardised test of language development that places performance in one or more of the main areas of speech and language development at two standard deviations or more below the mean, or at agenerally equivalent level.</i></p><p><i>- The pupil&rsquo;s difficulties are not attributable to hearing impairment; where the pupil is affected to some degree by hearing impairment, the hearing threshold for the speech-related frequencies should be 40Db;</i></p><p><i>- Emotional and behavioural disorders or a physical disability are not considered to be primary causes.</i></p><p><i>- Pupils with speech and language delays and difficulties are not to be considered under this category.</i></p><p><i>- In the case of specific speech and language disorder it is a pupil's non-verbal or performance ability that must be within the average range or above. (i.e. non-verbal or performance IQ of 90, or above).</i></p><p><i>- The pupil must also have been assessed by a speech and language therapist and found to be at two or more standard deviations (S.D.) below the mean, or at a generally equivalent level (i.e. - 2 S.D. or below, at or below a standard score of 70) in one or more of the main areas of speech and language development.</i></p><p><i>Two assessments, a psychological assessment and a speech and language assessment are necessary in this case.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The enrolment of pupils in an SSLD special class is managed locally by an Admissions &amp;amp; Discharges Committee, comprising the Speech and Language Therapy Manager, Speech and Language Therapist, Class Teacher and Principal.</p><p>It should be noted that pupils who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in Circular 0038/2007, may qualify for additional teaching support under the School's Special Education Teaching Support provision, where he/she is enrolled in a mainstream school.  </p><p>A new model for allocating support to pupils with special educational needs has been implemented from September 2017.  Circular 0013/2017 for primary schools which was published on 7 March 2017 sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have also been published; .  One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.</p><p>Pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD) may, therefore, attend a special class for pupils with SSLD with speech and language therapy services provided in class by the HSE or attend a mainstream school with additional teaching supports and speech and language therapy through the primary care service.  </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government states that a new model of In-School Speech and Language Therapy will be established.  It also contains a commitment to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.</p><p>A joint working group, made up of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education, has been established to develop the proposed model.  When finalised, the proposed model will represent a significant change in the way in which services are delivered.</p></reply>

Tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost. In addition, higher education institutions have provisions in place to allow students to pay the contribution in two moieties. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in 2016, outlined the need for an increase in investment in higher education across current, capital and student support budgets including a recommendation for an increase of &euro;1 billion in core funding for higher education institutions by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Report is currently being considered by the Joint Oireachtas committee for Education and Skills and I look forward to receiving their recommendations which will assist in facilitating informed decision-making and the building, where possible, of a consensus approach for the future direction of funding for higher education.  Accordingly, no policy decisions are being taken in this area pending the outcome of examination of the Cassells report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing a more sustainable funding model for higher education, as evidenced by the fact that Budget 2017 provided the first increase in investment in higher education since 2009, involving &euro;36.5 million extra funding in 2017 and &euro;160 million extra over 3 years.  In addition the Government is exploring the possibility of an employer-Exchequer funding mechanism which could realise up to &euro;200 million in additional annual funding by 2020.</p></reply>

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.   </p>  <p>  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.    </p>  <p>  My Department's SNA scheme is designed to provide recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE which is an independent statutory body) of which, its functions include planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE).

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support as set out in accordance with Circular 30 of 2014. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE takes into account the assessed individual needs of all children with identified needs in the school.  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.  </p>  <p>  An additional 975 SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools from September 2017 which is a 7.5% increase to meet the demands for the new school year.  A total of 13,990 SNA posts are now available at a gross annual cost of &euro;458 million.  This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support.  In total, the number of SNAs available has increased by over 32% since 2011, when 10,575 posts were available.  </p>  <p>  Details of SNA allocations which have been made to schools have been published by the NCSE on their website at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The organisation of supports within schools is a matter for each individual school to manage, taking into account each child's individual needs.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the supports, including SNA support, is utilised.</p>  <p>  Parents who have concerns regarding the manner in which the supports which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school should, in the first instance, raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. </p></reply>

As a result, Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but does engage with Taiwan on an economic and cultural basis. </p>  <p>  Ireland enjoys a strong trading relationship with Taiwan. According to the Central Statistics Office, total bilateral trade between Ireland and Taiwan stood at &euro;1,133 million in 2015, the latest year for which full trading statistics are available. </p>  <p>  The scale and configuration of the State&rsquo;s mission network in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s interests and values in a fast-changing world is under continual review by my Department and by the Government.  The ambition set by the Taoiseach to double our global footprint by 2025 responds to the scale and complexity of challenges that we face as a country in the years ahead. Following the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement, my Department has begun to examine options to expand our footprint and influence internationally in consultation with other Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland services Taiwan from its office in Hong Kong while IDA&rsquo;s ASEAN office in Singapore currently covers Taiwan with regard to the potential for inward Foreign Direct Investment. Market intelligence in relation to Taiwan indicates that the current footprint is appropriate.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that the statutory provisions in place under our National Monuments Acts continue to provide a suitable framework in which to control undesirable treasure-hunting and illicit damage to archaeology and in these circumstances I do not propose to change the law in this respect.</p>  <p>  The experience in the 1970s and earlier part of the 1980s was that the absence of specific statutory provisions regulating use of detection devices for archaeological purposes, and their possession on known archaeological sites, greatly contributed to an upsurge in improper and illicit removal of archaeological objects, causing serious harm and loss to our national archaeological heritage. </p>  <p>  It was against that background that the Oireachtas enacted section 2 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987.  I consider that the current level of statutory regulation, and the manner in which this is implemented, is reasonable, appropriate and necessary given the threat posed by illegal metal detectorists that is causing irreparable damage to our national heritage.</p>  <p>  There is no outright prohibition on the use of detection devices for archaeological purposes in the Irish State under the National Monuments Acts.  Rather it is an activity that is subject to statutory regulation which may be carried out lawfully if done under, and in accordance with, a consent granted by me. </p></reply>

The launch document for the programme identified ten actions for 2017, under five specific pillars:</p><p>- Enabling the Creative Potential of Every Child</p><p>- Enabling Creativity in Every Community</p><p>- Investing in our Creative and Cultural Infrastructure</p><p>- Ireland as a centre of Excellence in Media Production</p><p>- Unifying our Global reputation</p><p>I am glad to report that there has been significant progress in relation to the delivery of the ten actions identified for 2017.  With regard to Pillar 2, which is focused on local communities, a Culture Team has been established in each of the 31 local authorities and each local authority has produced a 2017 Creative Ireland Plan and is in the process of drawing up a more detailed 2018 Creative Plan setting out a five year plan for local creativity. </p><p>These policy initiatives are supported by significant additional resources which are being directed towards the arts and culture sector. </p><p>For example, this year I announced details of more than &euro;10 million in capital funding to a total of 122 arts organisations around the country under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018.

The archaeological and built heritage goals of my Department's National Monuments Service and Built Heritage and Architectural Policy Section working with key stakeholder agencies, are to conserve and manage our unique heritage for the benefit of present and future generations.  My Department also works in close partnership with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which manages the State's portfolio of heritage properties on my behalf. </p><p>The role of heritage in driving tourism is well known, with research by a number of bodies, including Tourism Ireland providing objective data on its economic return, which is substantial  as the ever-increasing record number of visitors to this island are drawn in many instances by its heritage and culture.  Data indicates that some 6.63 million visits were recorded at OPW managed sites in 2016, an increase from just over 2 million visits in 2008.  Over 80,000 children availed of the OPW's <i>Free Schools Visits</i>programme during 2016 and free access was also given to all children under the age of twelve throughout the summer season.</p><p>Our built and archaeological heritage also plays a critical role in assisting communities across the country in sustaining pride of place as well as employment.  Guidance on the extremely popular <i>Adopt a Monument</i>scheme has been issued by the Heritage Council in recent months providing a framework and guidance to community groups who wish to actively engage with their heritage.</p><p>My Department is working with the OPW and F&aacute;ilte<b></b>Ireland through a Strategic Partnership Agreement aimed at delivery of capital and non-capital initiatives at key heritage sites in my ownership.  The priority goal is to improve the experience of visitors, of tourists, of school children and the general public alike, through improvement of interpretation, access and facilities, including car-parking, in line with the conservation agenda of each site.  </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s heritage officials are also working with colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development to ensure that built heritage across the country is receiving investment through local and community-led projects that are helping to drive heritage tourism and economic renewal throughout rural Ireland.</p><p>In terms of identifying sites, the Archaeological Survey of Ireland within my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service continues its work in mapping our archaeological resource of over 140,000 monuments across the country, assisted by the notification of potential new sites by members of the public and our 3rd level education sector.</p><p>Excavations are carried out at national monuments in my ownership or guardianship to facilitate conservation works and to improve presentation for educational and tourism purposes.  Recent excavations carried out for such purposes have included St. John&rsquo;s Castle, Carlingford, Co. Louth,  Glendalough Co. Wicklow and at the Rock of Cashel, Co. Tipperary.  All such archaeological excavations are of course undertaken under licences issued by me in accordance with the National Monuments Acts.  Such licences are only issued to suitably qualified archaeologists who submit proposals that comply with standards of best practice. </p><p>My Department also supports a country-wide programme of research excavations through the Standing Committee for Archaeology in the Royal Irish Academy.  Current projects include excavations at Caherconnell in the Burren, Co. Clare which has become a busy tourist attraction and at Ballynamintra Cave in Co. Waterford.  A number of other research excavations, predominantly organised by the academic sector, have been recently licensed at sites in counties Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Sligo and Mayo. </p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>My Department also maintains the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH), a State initiative to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently as an aid in the protection and conservation of the built heritage.  I recommend structures rated as being of regional importance or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures<i>.</i>However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authorities.</p><p>Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings. These schemes are administered via the local authorities and include the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Structures at Risk Fund. </p><p>Under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014, my Department has established and maintains the Record of Monuments and Places, which affords legal protection to over 120,000 recorded archaeological sites and monuments in the State.  Anyone proposing works to a monument that is included in the Record of Monument and Places must give my Department two months prior notice before works can start.</p><p>As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites and in such cases there is a statutory duty to maintain the national monument.  Such maintenance is undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  Local authorities are responsible under the National Monuments Acts for maintaining the national monuments of which they are owners or guardians. </p><p>My Department is providing &euro;350,000 of funding to the OPW in 2017 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic buildings and national monuments in State ownership.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service works in close collaboration with the OPW on survey, excavation and research work to optimise the protection, management, interpretation and presentation of national monuments in State care.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  Grant schemes for 2017 are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>

Its statutory remit is to assist and encourage the making of film in the State and the development of a film industry in Ireland.  The Film Board supports writers, directors and production companies across these sectors by providing investment loans for the development, production and distribution of film, television and animation projects. </p><p>The Film Board also supports the Irish screen industries at major international markets and festivals, promotes inward investment, the use of Ireland as a location for international production and provides support for companies filming in Ireland.  The Board liaises with IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland to maximise opportunities for the promotion of Ireland as a location for film productions as well as a tourism destination.  Information on its funding scheme is available on the Irish Film Board website at <i>www.irishfilmboard.ie.</i></p><p>In Budget 2017, I secured an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board, bringing the total allocation for 2017 to over &euro;16m.  This increase in funding will allow the Board to invest more in Irish talent and follows on from a very successful year for the Irish film sector, particularly the indigenous film sector, in 2016. </p><p>The other primary mechanism through which the Government supports the film industry is Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme.  My Department&rsquo;s investment in the film sector will also help to maximise the benefits brought about by the Government&rsquo;s enhancement of the Section 481 film tax credit system, including the decision to increase the cap for eligible expenditure on film projects to &euro;70 million, as announced as part of Budget 2016.</p><p>The twin approach of direct funding and tax expenditure measures maximises the benefits of Government&rsquo;s support to the audiovisual industry.</p><p>In addition to the supports outlined above the Creative Ireland Programme 2017 &ndash; 2022 which was announced in December 2016 is a cross-Government initiative to mainstream culture and creativity in the life of the nation and to promote individual, community and national well-being. </p><p>The objective of the fourth pillar of the Programme &ndash; establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production &ndash; is to elevate the creative industries including media, architecture, design, digital technology, fashion, food and crafts together on an all of government basis.  The initial focus of the Creative Ireland programme this year is to undertake to develop an industry-wide, long-term plan for Ireland as a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation by the end of 2017.  This objective is also reflected in the Action Plan for Rural Ireland given the importance of the film industry to rural Ireland. </p><p>In this regard, my Department has commissioned an economic analysis of our screen based creative industries, in partnership with the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This study will examine the economic impact including employment and the potential of the Irish film, TV and animation sector.  Following an open tender process, Olsberg SPI Ltd in association with Nordicity, was selected to conduct the study in November last year.  The commissioning of the study was also a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016. </p><p>The recommendations of the economic study will inform the development of the plan envisaged under the Creative Ireland Programme for an industry-wide, long term plan, for Ireland as a global digital hub for the production of film, TV Drama and animation.</p><p>On 5 May last, I hosted a very successful Media Production Workshop at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which attracted attendance by representatives of the film, broadcast, animation and gaming industries.  The outcomes of this event will also input into the consultant's study and the proposed Government plan. It is intended that the economic study will be completed shortly and that the Government plan based on the study will be published by end of the year.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p><p>Over recent years activity in acute hospitals has increased, with the total number of discharges of inpatients and daycases rising around 34% between 2006 and 2015.  Last year alone there was a 4% increase in inpatient and daycase activity over 2015, and in 2016 1.69 million patients received inpatient or daycase treatment in our hospitals, an increase of almost 40,000 on the previous year.</p><p>Clinical need will determine that some patients require care more urgently than others and it is appropriate that patients are prioritised on this basis.  However, in order to provide a fair and equitable service, it is also essential that waiting times are reduced by addressing the needs of those patients longest waiting through effective chronological scheduling.</p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding. Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 23,800 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  </p><p>The NTPF has  advised that to date 5,901 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its initiatives, 2,235 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,112 patients have received their procedure.  The NTPF has also indicated that 2,841 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 910 offers of treatment have been accepted and 285 patients have been treated.</p><p>Under the Oupatient Plan, since early February, more than 84,200 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List  <font color="#FF0000">.</font></p></reply>

The General Scheme will include provisions for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation. Under this system, consent will be deemed unless the person has, while alive, registered his/her wish not to become an organ donor after death. However, the next-of-kin will always be consulted prior to removing any organ.</p><p>One of the aims of the legislation is to make organ donation the norm in Ireland when people pass away in circumstances in which donation is a possibility.  The introduction of an opt-out system of consent for organ donation will be accompanied by a publicity campaign aimed at raising awareness of organ donation and encouraging discussion among families of the intentions of family members in relation to organ donation.</p><p>A public consultation on the proposed Human Tissue Bill commenced on 28 August 2017.  The consultation questionnaire is available online at and the closing date for submissions is 9 October 2017.</p></reply>

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 430,000 customers.  </p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum. </p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, there was a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;227, and of the maximum rate of the contributory pension to &euro;238.30.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, along with pro-rata increases for Increases for Qualified Adults.  The value of these increases is well in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has responsibility for the Seniors Alert Scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The grant assistance is made available through community and voluntary groups registered with that Department and the equipment supplied under the scheme remains the property of the community group.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  In the previous two Budgets, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.</p>  <p>  Since 1 February 2017, all participants commencing on the RSS have to be over 25 years of age and a 6 year overall participation limit on the work scheme also applies.  The new measure ensures that places become available to provide opportunities for other farmers and fishermen to take part in the scheme.  RSS participants who commenced on the scheme prior to 1 February 2017 will remain on the scheme, as long as they continue to remain eligible for the scheme.</p>  <p>  To be eligible to participate on the RSS, an individual must satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  This includes having an entitlement to one of the qualifying social welfare payments and maintaining an underlying entitlement to Farm/Fish Assist.  </p>  <p>  This Department has a strong governance ethos in relation to all funding provided for the administration of its schemes and programmes.  It endeavours at all times to ensure that only eligible customers benefit from these schemes.  This also applies to people who are already participating on a scheme.  </p>  <p>  Participants on the RSS are given an annual contract if they continue to satisfy the conditions of the scheme.  In the event that any of the conditions pertaining to the scheme are not satisfied, the RSS contract cannot be renewed.  In addition, payments can be reviewed at any stage to ensure that participants continue to satisfy the underlying conditions and to ensure that they receive their correct entitlement.  This practice has been in place since the commencement of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The control of RSS is aligned with the aims to reduce fraud and minimise risks to public funds on an ongoing basis.  Any change in a participants/household circumstances should be notified to the Department as this may impact on their continued entitlement and their rate of payment.  These rules apply to all participants on the RSS regardless of their location. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, my Department has provided support to local authorities to return vacant social housing units to productive use and make them available for re-letting in an energy efficient condition at a reasonable cost.  The Department&rsquo;s funding is to support the authorities in tackling those houses that may require a greater level of remediation than the normal level of pre-letting repairs that is the responsibility of local authorities as part of their on-going repair and maintenance of local authority housing.  </p><p>These targeted measures focus exclusively on vacant and boarded-up properties with the objective of returning these to productive use as quickly as possible over the period of the programme.  Retrofitting is undertaken on properties selected by local authorities on the basis of unit cost, the extent of local housing need and the age/condition of the property.  Since the commencement of the programme in 2014, over 7,300 properties have been remediated and a further 1,400 units are expected to be returned to productive use this year. </p></reply>
