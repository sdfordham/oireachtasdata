    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-04a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017100400069#WRA00694"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos 30, 33, 48 and 65 together.</p>  <p>  Recognising the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.</p>  <p>I established the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce (the 'Taskforce') in July 2016, arising from that commitment, to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce  which I co-chaired, consulted and engaged with telecoms industry representatives to identify short and medium term solutions to alleviate telecommunications deficits, particularly in rural Ireland. The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce is available on my Departments' website.</p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to publish a Final report in December 2016 which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  The Report is also available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Key measures among the 40 actions contained in the Taskforce Report included measures to streamline and prioritise planning procedures for telecoms infrastructure, a licensing regime to allow people to boost their home signals using repeaters, the build out of new ducting along the M7 / M8, measures to help stakeholders make informed choices in relation to their network provider and handsets, and general network improvements.</p>  <p>  To maintain momentum, I established an Implementation Group together to drive progress on implementing the measures recommended by the Taskforce. The establishment of the Implementation Group is a commitment in the Action Plan for Rural Development. I co-chair the Implementation Group with Minister of State Sean Kyne.</p>  <p>  The Group comprises key stakeholders identified in the Taskforce report with responsibility for delivery of actions. Officials in both Departments are working closely together to oversee delivery of the actions.</p>  <p>  The membership comprises the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers&rsquo; Association. ComReg, the independent Regulator for the telecommunications sector, also sits on the Group in an advisory role and also in respect of its ownership of a number of key actions.  This key stakeholder interaction will ensure that strong momentum and timely delivery is maintained over the coming months, and will enable early identification and proactive management of any emerging challenges to the delivery of actions. In addition to overseeing the delivery of actions by the State entities, the Group will monitor and track progress made on actions owned by telecommunications operators. Quarterly progress reports are being produced and published on the status of Taskforce actions, the second quarterly report having been published in July 2017. The first two quarterly progress reports are accessible on the DCCAE website. These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry. In addition, a comprehensive Annual Review of progress will be undertaken at the end of 2017. </p>  <p> A National Stakeholder Forum will also be held on Friday 6 October 2017 in Athlone, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable discussion on all the issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure. This work will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  The Forum will be hosted by me and by Minster Kyne, and it will feature a range of stakeholders from across the telecoms sector, including action owners, Government Departments, the independent Regulator, industry representatives, as well as consumer representatives. The event will afford an opportunity to review progress made, and to identify potential new actions. Feedback from this event will be incorporated into the Annual Review, in order to inform the Year 1 Annual Report of the Implementation Group.     </p>  <p>In addition, following Regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.</p>  <p>The very significant commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

Through training and mentoring, coupled with financial support of up to &euro;2,500, subject to matched funding, the scheme is helping small businesses to grow and diversify their markets.     </p>  <p>  This is a demand-led scheme, funded by my Department and delivered on a nationwide basis by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  I have allocated &euro;3m in 2017 to deliver 1,000 more businesses trading online by the end of the year.  By end June, 600 businesses had successfully applied to the Scheme this year, bringing to over 3,500 the number of businesses who have availed of grant assistance under the Scheme. Approximately 9,000 businesses have benefited from the training.  The latest figures available show that 44 businesses in County Laois and 53 businesses in County Offaly have successfully applied for a trading online voucher since the scheme was introduced in 2014.</p>  <p>  My Department has measured the impacts on the businesses who have participated.  According to our surveys, businesses grow on average by 21%, employ 35% more people and 60% export for the first time.  The Scheme is helping to revitalise small businesses, including sole traders, from across a wide range of sectors including retail, arts, crafts and design, manufacturing, food, and professional services.  Digital trade is contributing to sustainable regional economic development, with urban and rural based businesses benefitting equally from the online opportunity.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently scoping initiatives to build on the success of the scheme, putting Ireland further ahead of our European counterparts in realising the benefits of selling goods and services online.  This will include the development of a national website and centralised web-based infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with the LEOs, my Department is delivering a series of regional events to showcase the benefits of trading online, provide training and increase awareness of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme. Events have been held in Ballinasloe, Cork, Dublin, Kilkenny and Roscommon.  Details of the next event, to take place in Cavan on 9th October, are available on my Department's website (www.dccae.gov.ie/tradingonlinevoucher).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-04a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017100400069#WRA01000"><p>As I have already indicated to the House, last week my Department received "Detailed Solutions" from two bidders as part of the ongoing procurement process to select a company, or companies, who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network for those areas that will not be served by commercial operators acting alone. This was a significant milestone in the procurement process which is now entering into its final stages.  Early in 2018, it is expected that bidders will be invited to submit their final tenders.    </p>  <p>  The facts are that the National Broadband Plan has been a catalyst in driving commercial operators in their deployment of high speed broadband to the extent that today almost 7 out of 10 premises now have access to high speed broadband.  This figure will rise to nearly 8 out 10 premises by 2018 and 9 out of 10 by 2020.  In the last 6 months there has been a 150% increase in the number of pure fibre connections albeit from a low base.</p>  <p>  eir has passed 101,000 premises as at the end of September and are on track to honour its commitment to provide 300,000 premises in rural Ireland with high speed broadband by the end of 2018, as agreed with me in April of this year.  Other players in the market have also ramped up the speed of their roll out.  For example, SIRO is investing &euro;450m to provide fibre broadband to 500,000 premises across 51 towns on an open access basis, while enet and SSE are investing &euro;100m in pure fibre broadband to 115,000 premises in the West and North West.</p>  <p>  For the information of the Deputy, there are over 90,000 premises in County Kildare, 77,000 of which fall within a BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators.  Of these 77,000, circa 7,000 premises form part of eir's planned rural deployment.  The remaining 13,000 premises in County Kildare fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce (the 'Taskforce') was established in July 2016 to consult and engage with telecoms industry representatives in order to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate telecommunications deficits, particularly in rural Ireland, prior to full build and rollout of the network planned under the State Intervention.  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact  in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers are already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring  a much greater degree of consistency  in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to infrastructure.  Contact details for the local Kildare Broadband Officer can be accessed on the link to the list of  broadband officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The submissions received means that we are at the final stages of this procurement process.  My Department's specialist NBP team are now evaluating these two submissions over the coming weeks, with the expectation that very early in 2018 bidders will be invited to submit final tenders</p>  <p>  As I have already informed the House, just ahead of the closing date for "Detailed Solutions", SIRO formally communicated its withdrawal from the National Broadband Plan procurement process.  In doing so however, SIRO remains strongly committed to its original commitment to invest &euro;450m to provide pure fibre broadband to 51 towns across Ireland on an open access basis.  As of the end of last week, some 100,000 premises have been passed by SIRO. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding SIRO's withdrawal, the fact remains that this procurement process is still competitive involving two strong operators in the telecommunications field.</p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal compared the cost of supporting Solar PV (both rooftop and ground mounted) and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, at various scales including micro-generation, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p><p>By way of a comparison, at the end of 2016, in Ireland 27.2% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources, which is very close to the EU average and represents one of the highest asynchronous renewable electricity penetration levels in Europe or the rest of the world.  Other EU member states renewable electricity figures for end 2015 can be found in the following table:<table><tr><th>Country</th><th>2015 (% electricity from renewable sources)</th></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>15.4</td></tr><tr><td>Bulgaria</td><td>19.1</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>51.3</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>22.1</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>18.8</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>33.5</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>11.1</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>70.3</td></tr><tr><td>EU-28</td><td>28.8</td></tr></table></p><p>Micro generation, including the use of solar PV panels on domestic rooftops, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before the introduction of a tariff for exported electricity from solar PV rooftop installations.  These include, among others, a reform of electricity network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing between those who can afford to participate and those that can not), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. </p><p>This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states and other countries around the world for example, from America and from Australia and Germany, each of whom have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation and whose failure to address these issues from the outset has led to regressive distributional impacts on the poorer in society.</p><p>I am committed to finding an appropriate mechanism for supporting micro generation, but it must be achieved in a fair and balanced manner, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects.</p><p>I have asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to facilitate a workshop on micro generation which will take place on the 17th of this month.  Over 100 focused stakeholders have been invited including the main trade organisations, public representatives, financial exerts, community groups, grid and energy sectors, NGOs and certain external organisations such as the FAI.  38 have already committed to attend and participate with the end goal being the development of a policy position on how to best support micro generation in Ireland.</p><p>Finally, a public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September and submissions are invited from the public.  All submissions will be considered and following on from this a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval.  Full details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p></reply>

The level of illegal dumping of various waste types is a major environmental problem that needs to be met head on.  I have made &euro;1.3 million available to support a major anti-dumping initiative by local authorities and communities.  In addition, I have allocated &euro;1 million to local authorities to remove stockpiles of waste tyres.  The local authorities have indicated to me that there are more than 750,000 tyres randomly dumped in sites around the country, and this is a conservative estimate.</p>  <p>  I have also taken actions to stem the problem of more waste tyres ruining rural areas.  The new management scheme for waste tyres took effect no 1 October.  Over 1,600 tyre retailer, producer and collector premises have already registered with the new scheme.  This sign-up demonstrates to me that the overwhelming majority of tyre suppliers want to ensure that their products are managed properly as a waste.  I welcome the efforts, as I am sure all Deputies do, that the compliant industry has made by joining the new scheme and working together to ensure that waste tyres do not continue to be a blight on our countryside. </p>  <p>  A new compliance scheme for tyres will be operated by Repak End of Life Tyres (ELT) with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited (PRL).  The scheme will carry out all regulatory functions on behalf of its members and will be funded by a visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC).  Currently the EU single market facilitates cross border trade.  Fees for the collection and management of waste tyres have previously been charged, but this has not always been transparent or effective, as suggested by the level of tyres being dumped around the country.  The flow of tyres from one jurisdiction to another has more to do with currency fluctuations than making an environmental cost on a tyre more visible.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the concerns of the tyre industry regarding the new structures.  I have met with the tyre representative bodies. I listened to their concerns and I have done my best to address as many of them as possible.  I have also received a lot of support during the extensive consultation that has taken place.</p>  <p>  In order to support the compliant majority of the tyre industry, the new structures will be supported by a strong enforcement regime, which will be a priority for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs).  In addition, the EPA has a new enforcement role to ensure producers register with PRL and provide all relevant data.  Tyres are one of the five priority areas for enforcement in 2017, as agreed by the National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee, and I have made &euro;9 million available this year in relation to waste enforcement. I will be asking the EPA and Local Authorities to begin a visible enforcement campaign on tyres, particularly in border areas.</p></reply>

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.</p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  To maintain momentum, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This group will report on progress every 90 days.  The Implementation Group has met twice this year, in March and July, and is due to meet again in October.  Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which are available on my Department's website.  These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.</p>  <p>  A stakeholder forum is planned for later this month, to be held in Athlone, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable discussion on all the issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.  It will also inform the review to be conducted prior to completion of an annual report by the Implementation Group at end 2017.</p>  <p>  This work will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.</p>  <p>The very significant commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

These policies, approved by the Board of IFI, were developed by two working groups which included <i>inter alia </i>representatives from the main Trout and Pike Angling Federations.</p><p>A review of these policies was scheduled to commence in 2017. However, recognising the concerns of some stakeholders in relation to elements of the policies, the Board of IFI decided to bring forward the review period and commence the process in 2016 with a public consultation process.  The public consultation process was held in November 2016 through which almost 300 submissions were received.</p><p>One of the most important issues considered in the previous policies relates to the management of pike in designated wild brown trout fisheries. In late 2016, a Review Group, across all disciplines in IFI, was established to specifically consider this issue. The Review Group met with Pike and Trout representative bodies in January 2017 following which representatives from a number of these organisations were invited to join the Group.</p><p>In May 2017, the Group, including the pike and trout angling representatives, met for two information gathering meetings at which a number of expert scientists made presentations. The Review Group adjourned after its meeting of 29 May to provide time to review and assimilate the data and information provided during the two information gathering meetings.  The Group reconvened earlier this month.</p><p>The presentations delivered at the meetings, along with minutes of the previous meetings and the public consultation submissions are publically available on the IFI website: www.fisheriesireland.ie. </p><p>I want to emphasise that while the policy review is underway, delivery of the current IFI pike management practices have continued in line with the existing policy. Therefore there has been no change to current policy or practice regarding the management of pike in designated wild brown trout fisheries. </p><p>It would not be appropriate, in these circumstances, to make any recommendations on policy change in advance of the report from the inclusive Review Group or to pre-empt its recommendations.  IFI have advised that the report is expected to be finalised in early 2018. Decisions on any change in the management of Pike and Trout will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>I am advised by IFI that they recognise the diverse opinions of stakeholders and as a Public Authority are obliged to consider all viewpoints on this issue. I would encourage open and objective participation by all stakeholders in the Review Group in order to seek consensus on the main issues.</p></reply>

The Plan identifies over 70 mitigation measures and 106 related actions to address the immediate challenge to 2020 and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030. Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  There is no doubt that delivery of the measures in the National Mitigation Plan will, in many cases, require significant investment. However, decisions on the funding of particular measures will be a matter for Government consideration in the context of expenditure planning in the Estimates and Budgetary processes, including decisions on capital expenditure following the mid-term review of the current Capital Plan and in the forthcoming National Investment Plan for 2018-2027.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  Where relevant, the National Mitigation Plan already includes information on the expected Exchequer cost of implementing individual measures, either in the context of direct expenditure or in relation to tax foregone. The actual expenditure on a given measure will depend on progress in implementation of each measure, including its possible expansion as a result of additional funding, for which the relevant sectoral Minister retains direct responsibility. I, and other sectoral Ministers with a role in the National Mitigation Plan, continue to engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Budget and Estimates process with a view to ensuring that the investment requirements arising from the National Mitigation Plan are appropriately reflected in Budget 2018.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  In addition to measures in place, the National Mitigation Plan includes measures under consideration by Government. The potential costs for many of these measures have yet to be quantified and will depend on the basis on which a given measure is adopted for implementation.</font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  As already stated, given the complexity of the issues and time horizon involved, it is not be possible for the National Mitigation Plan to provide a complete roadmap to achieve our 2050 objective. Similarly, it does not yet provide a complete roadmap to meeting Ireland's expected targets between 2021 and 2030 under the draft EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Instead, the Plan will be subject to formal review at least once every five years and will also become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which will be updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate further cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy. As this first Plan moves into the implementation phase, this process will enable it to be amended, refined and strengthened over time and assist in keeping Ireland on target to meet our obligations.</font></p></reply>

The design of the new scheme has included an extensive independent economic appraisal. This appraisal compared the cost of supporting a range of commercial renewable electricity technologies, at various scales, to ensure that the new scheme delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply. The assessment also included analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.</p>  <p>  The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland. Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken. International best practice has been examined, and the most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.</p>  <p>Examples of some of these policies include a mandatory requirement for all renewable electricity projects seeking financial support through the new scheme to offer investment and/or ownership opportunities to the local community; the facilitation of grid access for community-led projects; a ring fencing of capacity (MW) for community-led projects; and the establishment of a national community benefits register. Furthermore, the Scheme will establish a network of trusted intermediaries who will act as independent facilitators between communities and developers to support community participation in renewable energy projects.</p>  <p>  These recommendations could have a profound effect, boosting community ownership of and involvement in the renewable energy transition in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Micro generation, including the use of solar PV panels on domestic rooftops, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before the introduction of a tariff for exported electricity from solar PV rooftop installations. These include amongst others, a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  I am committed to finding an appropriate mechanism for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy, in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country. I have asked the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to facilitate a workshop on micro generation, and this will take place later this month. All relevant stakeholders will be invited to participate with the end goal being the development of a policy position on how best to support micro generation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS was launched on 4 September and submissions are invited from the public. All submissions will be considered and following on from this final public consultation, a design proposal will be brought to Government for approval. Full details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: www.dccae.gov.ie</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. A significant milestone in that procurement process was reached last week with the submission of "Detailed Solutions" by two bidders.  This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders which is expected to occur in early 2018.</p>  <p>  To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established a Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 Megabits per second when the procurement process for the State led intervention is completed and the network rolled out.</p></reply>

In order to align the Annual Transition Statement requirements under the 2015 legislation with the National Mitigation Plan annual progress report, I propose to incorporate these into a single document from 2018 onwards. This annual reporting process will facilitate debate on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan in both Houses of the Oireachtas in each subsequent year.</font></p></reply>

As part of this work, I understand that the Assembly has been asked to consider how the National Dialogue on Climate Action should engage with the wider public to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act in relation to the challenges of climate change.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of the National Dialogue will be to ensure an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future. To do this, the Dialogue will seek to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change and to establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy. </p>  <p>  I expect that the work of the Citizens' Assembly will provide a valuable base of evidence and ideas from which to draw on in the preparation of further activities under the National Dialogue in the coming months, including proposals for regional gatherings and local community conversations incorporating innovative consultation mechanisms.</p>  <p>  National Dialogue initiatives already announced for 2017 include the Green Schools National Climate Change Action and Awareness Programme, incorporating Climate Action Week between 16 and 20 October and the Green Schools Climate Expo on 22 February 2018; and the Climate Ambassador Programme which was formally launched on the 18 September 2017.</p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is the lead organisation for the submission of Irish data on electricity and gas prices to Eurostat, and also publishes reports and analysis of these statistics twice yearly. The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) publishes reports on various business costs, including on electricity price statistics with commentary and analysis. </p>  <p>  In the area of electricity prices, CRU carries out statutory market monitoring functions and has the responsibility to ensure the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer, under various relevant Statutory Instruments. In February 2017 the CRU published its &ldquo;Review of Competition in the Electricity and Gas Retail Markets: A Consumer Focused Assessment&rdquo;, in line with its competition and consumer protection functions and reflecting a CRU commitment in the energy policy White Paper to publish a consumer focussed assessment of the development of competition in retail markets. This report, as well as CRU&rsquo;s quarterly &ldquo;Electricity and Gas Retail Markets Reports&rdquo;, published since 2010, are available on the CRU website. I am periodically provided with briefing and commentary on these publications.</p>  <p>  The CRU&rsquo;s review of competition in the electricity and gas retail markets makes a number of detailed findings, specifically in relation to consumer engagement, consumer protection, market entry and prices. It concludes by making a number of proposals to address the issues identified within the report, and it will be important that the outcomes of these proposals both for consumers and for competition are analysed and assessed in due course.</p>  <p>  In this regard I must reiterate that the CRU is accountable for the performance of its functions to a Committee of the Oireachtas, and not to me the Minister or indeed the Government.</p></reply>

The Regional Waste Management Planning Offices will continue to roll out waste awareness and education initiatives this year, re-focussing on the use of the brown bin, but also concentrating on improving and increasing recycling, waste prevention and the correct use of the kerbside collection system.

The submissions received means that we are at the final stages of this procurement process.  My Department's specialist NBP team are now evaluating these two submissions over the coming weeks, with the expectation that very early in 2018, bidders will be invited to submit final tenders. As the level of State subsidy required for the National Broadband Plan will be determined through the competitive tender process, it would be premature and not in the public interest, to discuss costs while that procurement process is still in train. The process remains competitive.      </p>  <p>  As the House is aware, SIRO formally withdrew from the procurement process last week.  SIRO remain strongly supportive of the National Broadband Plan and will focus on its investment of &euro;450m to provide fibre broadband to 500,000 premises across 51 towns.</p>  <p>  The facts are that the National Broadband Plan has been a catalyst in driving commercial operators in their deployment of high speed broadband to the extent that today almost 7 out of 10 premises now have access to high speed broadband.  This figure will rise to nearly 8 out 10 premises by 2018 and 9 out of 10 by 2020.  In the last 6 months there has been a 150% increase in the number of pure fibre connections.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the combination of existing commercial investment and the State intervention will make Ireland an exemplar in Europe and beyond, in terms of providing high speed services to all citizens regardless of where they live or work.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005. This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020. The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan sets out what Ireland is currently doing, and is planning to do, to further the national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015. Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States. Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emission reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018. However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances. While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p></reply>

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement. In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.     </p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States. The specific details of Ireland's contribution are currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States.</p>  <p>  The Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo; sets out a vision and framework to guide Irish energy policy and the actions that Government intends to take in the energy sector from now up to 2030, aimed at transforming Ireland's fossil-fuel based energy sector into a clean, low carbon system by 2050. This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. The White Paper identifies the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon energy future will involve progressively moving to lower emissions fuels, e.g. moving initially from peat and coal to natural gas, and ultimately towards an even greater reliance on renewable energy. In that regard, the Government has introduced a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and deliver energy efficiency. In 2015, over 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was generated from renewable energy sources.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also recognises that oil and natural gas will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.</p>  <p>  Ireland sources all its oil needs from abroad. In addition, Ireland currently sources its gas supply from the Kinsale gasfields, the Corrib gasfield and the gas pipeline from Moffat in Scotland. Corrib and Kinsale are not in a position to meet all of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas demand and so Ireland will continue to rely on gas via Great Britain for the foreseeable future. The Kinsale fields are expected to cease production by 2021 while Corrib production is projected to decrease to 50 per cent of its initial levels by 2025.</p>  <p>  Taking this into account, successful exploration in Ireland&rsquo;s Offshore has the potential to deliver benefits to Irish society and the economy, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply and reduced fossil fuel imports, as we transition to a low carbon future.</p></reply>

In 2017 the Increase for a Qualified Child is &euro;29.80 per week. </p>  <p>  There is no generally available tax credit in respect of child dependants, but the Deputy will be aware that there are a number of tax credits which may apply to certain families with children, including the Single Person Child Carer tax credit, the Incapacitated Child tax credit, the Widowed Parent tax credit and the Home Carer tax credit.</p>  <p>  Working families on lower incomes may also qualify for Family Income Supplement (FIS), a weekly additional income payment available to employees with children. Further information on FIS is available from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that a new Affordable Childcare Scheme was introduced by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs last year, to assist families with the costs involved in providing care for their children.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the range of supports currently available both via the tax system and through direct supports, it is my view that the introduction of a new tax credit of the nature proposed by the Deputy would not be the best use of limited resources at this time.</p></reply>

Financial reporting obligations and accounting practices are matters solely for the Board and Management of each institution. Each of the SSM (Single Supervisory Mechanism) regulated institutions produces detailed, externally audited accounts in line with international accounting best practice. In addition, these banks have required minimum capital levels, which are assessed and scrutinised by the Joint Supervisory team (JST) comprising officials of both the SSM and the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The capital treatment of Non-Performing Loans and mortgage restructures, including split loans with a warehoused element, is in accordance with the CRD IV which forms the basis of prudential requirements for banks. The minimum capital requirements are determined by the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) conducted by the SSM.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank have confirmed to my officials that "credit institutions are required to comply with a range of classification requirements including the Regulatory definition of default as per Article 178 of the Capital Requirements Regulation; the Accounting definition of impaired as per the applicable accounting framework (e.g. IAS 39) and the Supervisory definition of non-performing as per the EBA ITS* on forbearance and non-performing exposures."</p>  <p>  Therefore, each bank would need to consider the impact on its reporting and compliance obligations in the event of a hypothetical change as described by the Deputy. One cannot assume, in this regard, a direct impact from a change in definition determining the recognition of NPLs on the minimum capital requirements that would be assigned to an institution by the SSM as part of their SREP.</p>  <p>  *Implementing Technical Standard.</p></reply>

The framework suggests that the US proposals will seek to tax the global profits of US multinationals at a rate below whatever new headline rate is agreed.  There has been no indication as to what level this lower rate may be set at.   If agreed, this would represent a change from the current system where the US tax the global profits of US multinationals when those profits are repatriated to the US at the full headline US tax rate. </p>  <p>  It is expected that the legislative debate on the proposals will begin later this month. Agreement between the House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and President Trump will be needed before any legislation can ultimately be agreed and any changes can be introduced.</p>  <p>  The exact implications of US tax reform for Ireland, and the rest of the world, will depend on the exact nature of any changes which are ultimately agreed.</p>  <p>  I have not yet spoken directly to my counterpart in the US administration in relation to the administration's tax reform plans.  My officials in the Department of Finance and our Embassies in the US, are closely tracking the debate in the US and continue to engage with business and others to fully understand the potential impacts of any US reform.</p></reply>

It is hoped that a final report will be published during the autumn/winter term. </p>  <p>  I believe that the implementation of these reports will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 12-18 months.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in motor insurance pricing in the short to medium term.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for August) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have reduced by 14% year-on-year.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  I am hopeful however that greater stability in pricing will continue to occur, and that premiums will continue to fall from the very high levels of last year.</p></reply>

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, launched the Office of Government Procurement&rsquo;s (OGP) Public Service Spend and Tender Analysis Report for 2015 report in September.  This is the OGP&rsquo;s third annual report that analyses expenditure and tendering activity on goods, services and minor works across public service bodies in Ireland.  I would point out that the analysis is encouraging, indicating that 94% of the State&rsquo;s expenditure is with firms within the State.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. Public expenditure on goods, works, and services representing approximately 14% of EU GDP with an annual value of nearly &euro;2 trillion. The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

A framework for Senior Cycle SPHE is also available to schools. </p>  <p>  The SPHE curriculum aims to provide a range of diverse and inclusive skills such as communicating, making decisions, knowing where to find reliable data, belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with bullying, expressing feelings and emotions, substance abuse, resisting peer pressure, personal safety, values and mutual respect. </p>  <p>  As the new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) is rolled out, schools should ensure that the junior cycle programme they design addresses the principles, statements of learning and key skills that relate to the areas currently covered in SPHE.  This can be achieved through continuing to provide the existing SPHE course, providing a short course in SPHE or other approaches.</p>  <p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle additionally provides for a new area of learning at junior cycle called Wellbeing.  Wellbeing will cross the three years of junior cycle and build on substantial work already taking place in schools in support of students&rsquo; wellbeing. This area of learning will make the school&rsquo;s culture and ethos and commitment to wellbeing visible to students.  It will include learning opportunities to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing of students. It will enable students to build life skills and develop a strong sense of connectedness to their school and to their community.  The Junior Cycle Wellbeing programme begins with 300 hours of timetabled engagement in 2017 and will build up to 400 hours by 2020 as the new junior cycle is implemented fully in schools.</p></reply>

This follows on from the identification of a number of issues in respect of the compliance by a number of schools constructed by WBS with their fire safety certificates.  My Department, at this stage, does not have any reason to believe that there are any fire safety issues in respect of any of the other buildings built by Western Building Systems.  These audits are a proactive measure being taken, following on from consultation with stakeholders, to satisfy the Department that there are no further issues with school buildings constructed by that company.  It is anticipated that this will take approximately 6 months to complete this number of audits.  However, in each case, the Department will require an early report from the Fire Safety Consultants conducting the audit if any issue of significant concern is discovered.</p><p>Further to this and as previously announced, my Department is in the process of commissioning fire safety audits of a representative sample of up to 25 schools constructed over the last 20 years.  It should be noted that each school building is already required to have and comply with a fire certificate awarded at time of construction by the local authority.</p><p>It is important to note that the selection of a school to be included in the sample for this audit in no way means that my Department has concerns about that particular school.  Regarding the timeline for this sample audit, it is expected to be concluded by January 2018. The tender for the appointment of fire safety consultants will be completed by the mid October.  It is expected that the first set of Fire Safety Audit Reports will be provided to my Department by the end of December 2017.</p><p>My Department will also contact the representative Professional Associations, principally the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland ((RIAI), Engineer&rsquo;s Ireland (IEI) and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland (ACEI) to discuss the operation of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations (2014) to re-iterate the responsibilities of Design Teams to fully engage in a complete and comprehensive way with the inspection and certification requirements of BC(A)R (2014).  It is the responsibility of the Design Team appointed to build a school to ensure that a newly constructed building is compliant with it&rsquo;s Fire Certificate.  My Department is writing to these associations to remind them of their members<b>&rsquo;</b>legal duties in this regard.</p><p>My Department has also written to all Design Teams working on buildings currently under construction to remind them of their responsibilities to ensure that all buildings comply with fire certificates awarded by the local authority</p><p>My Department will also issue a new Circular to all schools bringing the attention of the school authorities to their obligations in relation to Fire Safety management protocols. Detailed guidance documents are already in place to advice schools on managing Health and Safety in schools that includes comprehensive advice on the issue of managing the risk of fire.</p><p>My Department will, going forward, appoint a Clerk of Works to all future major building projects to enhance the oversight and inspection of works when they are being carried out.  This person, who will be appointed by the Department of Education and Skills, will provide an extra layer of checking and oversight during the construction process.</p><p>Additionally, an internal fire safety committee is being established within my Department.  This group will be made up of both technical and administrative staff, and will monitor any patterns arising from day to day interactions with schools, the results from the various audits and their own recent experience to shape any further action in this regard.</p><p>Finally, under a new protocol from now on, when my Department receives a fire audit report which demonstrates issues in a building regarding fire safety, my Department will immediately notify the school&rsquo;s Patron Body, the school&rsquo;s Board of Management and the Fire Officer in the relevant Local Authority.</p><p>These audits and actions will inform any further action which may be required by my Department to ensure that they are satisfied with the fire safety measures in place to protect schools.</p><p>My Department will contact the Chief Fire Officers Association to inform them of the above steps which are being taken.  A new protocol will also be put in place to keep them up to date with any further developments in this area.</p><p>It is worth noting again that my Department has no reason to believe that there are issues with fire safety provisions in schools generally.  These additional steps are an added precaution being taken by the Department, prompted by recent concerns in Ireland and abroad regarding fire safety in public buildings.</p></reply>

That independence has been purposefully conferred on the Authority by the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. This includes in the nomination of the Authority&rsquo;s membership by prescribed bodies, in its statutory objectives and in the independent performance of its functions.  I have every confidence, therefore, in the Authority&rsquo;s ability to regulate independently and effectively. </p><p>The setting-up of the Authority has been underway since July 2016.  At that time Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act were commenced as necessary to get the new Authority underway, particularly in terms of its nomination and appointment with the necessary motions of approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Authority has convened regularly since its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016 and makes minutes of its meetings available on its website<i>www.LSRA.ie. </i></p><p>In tandem with the ongoing and essential work leading to the Authority starting up its key complaints and regulatory functions, the Authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and in the making of reports on a series of issues which it has been obliged to complete within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016. For example, in December 2016, sections 118, 119 and 120 of Part 8 of the 2015 Act were commenced to enable the conduct of public consultations and reports by the new Regulatory Authority within the set statutory periods concerned.  These relate to Legal Partnerships (between solicitors and barristers and barristers and barristers - solicitors can already operate in partnerships), Multi-Disciplinary Practices (where legal practitioners can provide their services together with other non-legal services providers) and certain restrictions on the work of barristers.</p><p>On 31 March 2017 the Regulatory Authority presented its report under section 118 on Legal Partnerships which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 April 2017 and a further short report on the same issue submitted by the Authority on 31 July 2017 is in the course of being laid before the Houses.</p><p>On 31 March 2017 the Authority also presented its initial report under section 119 of the Act in relation to Multi-Disciplinary Practices which was laid before the Houses on 28 April 2017.  Following its conduct of the relevant public consultations the Authority has submitted a final report on this issue on 29 September 2017 which will, as required, be laid before the Houses.</p><p>On 6 April 2017, the Authority commenced its public consultations under section 120 of the 2015 Act about certain restrictions on the work of barristers.  These arise with regard to the holding of clients&rsquo; monies and to the direct provision of services to a client in relation to contentious matters.  The Authority submitted its report following these consultations on 29 September 2017 which is in the course of being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The Deputy will also wish to note that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority submitted its first Annual Report under the Act on 26 April 2017 which was duly laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 18 May 2016.  The Authority also makes such reports available, as appropriate and when laid before the Houses, on its website.</p><p>Having delivered these key reporting obligations the current working focus is very much on the managed roll-out of the Authority's remaining functions with the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources which are essential to effective delivery.  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers, will be commenced. Members of the public will no longer make complaints about alleged professional misconduct by legal practitioners through the legal professional bodies as happens at present, but rather through the independent Regulatory Authority. </p><p>In a key development the Authority has, this summer, completed its public recruitment and appointment of a full-time Chief Executive.  It has also recently secured larger office premises in support of the coming into operation of its respective functions.  This will also facilitate the Authority in appointing and determining the duties of further staff under sections 25 and 26 of the 2015 Act with the relevant approvals of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As with earlier commencements made under the 2015 Act, Statutory Instruments will issue as appropriate to the relevant sections or Parts of the Act concerned.</p><p>I and my Department continue to work closely with the Authority to enable it to come into substantive regulatory mode at the earliest opportunity.  The phased start-up of its various functions will continue to need careful project management.

The 2015 Act introduced a single procedure which enables all grounds for seeking international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) or permission to remain in the State for other reasons to be examined and determined in one process. </p><p>At the end of September 2017, there were some 4,950 applications awaiting processing in the International Protection Office (IPO).  The vast majority of these applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  These applications must be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act. Various categories of cases reverted to the IPO including asylum appeals transferred from the old Refugee Appeals Tribunal and asylum and subsidiary protection cases transferred from the old ORAC.  This added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload.</p><p>In terms of processing, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable progress has been made by the IPO in getting the new single procedure process up and running.  This follows IPO staff concentrating in the initial months of the year on the necessary preparatory work including issuing correspondence to all transitional applicants with details of the new processing arrangements, the handling of some 2,600 returned Application for International Protection Questionnaires including the translation of questionnaires (some 50% of which require translation) and the scheduling of interviews etc.  Furthermore, extensive training on the new procedures and processing arrangements has been delivered to staff in the IPO and supporting panel members (persons with legal qualifications who support International Protection Officers in their function.</p><p>To date, the IPO has also conducted almost 1,900 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU Relocation cases) and 69 interviews under the 2013 Subsidiary Protection Regulations.  More than 160 additional interviews have been scheduled in the IPO for the coming weeks with more interviews being scheduled on a daily basis.</p><p>A total of 463 grants for protection have issued this year to 19<sup>th</sup>September, comprising 325 granted refugee status under the Single Procedure and a further 69 legacy applicants were granted refugee status under the Refugee Act, 1996.  In addition, 54 grants of Subsidiary Protection under the legacy procedures were made.  A further 15 humanitarian permissions to remain were granted by the International Protection Office.</p><p>At the present time, it is not possible to calculate an accurate current median processing time for international protection applications due to the different case types on hands which were returned to the IPO under the transition provisions in the 2015 Act. Considerable additional resources, have and are, being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible.</p><p>In relation to the scheduling of interviews and the processing of cases in the IPO, I am also advised that the prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency. When the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors.  The IPO&rsquo;s approach to prioritisation has been agreed with the UNHCR and is available on its website:<i>www.ipo.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</p><p>My Department has made enquiries of the Courts Service in the matter and the following table sets out by District the number of persons who received the Poor Box for penalty point offences from Jan 2015 to 30 September 2017.

I understand that further arrivals are expected under the Calais Special Project and I wish to commend all those involved in the Project for their commitment to implementing this most important commitment.</p><p>In addition, Tusla, which has statutory responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors, has agreed to take up to 20 unaccompanied minors under the EU relocation programme.  To date, six unaccompanied minors, under the stricter Irish definition, have been relocated from Greece but there are relatively few unaccompanied minors available in the cohort of nationalities eligible for the relocation.</p><p>Efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort and it is hoped that further  unaccompanied minors  may arrive from Greece.  In this context it is worth noting that in its most recent report on relocation and resettlement, the European Commission specifically welcomed the actions taken by Ireland in respect of unaccompanied minors.  However, despite all Ireland's efforts it has proven extraordinarily difficult to find unaccompanied minors in Greece within the cohort eligible for relocation.  </p><p>All strands of the IRPP have had a strong focus on families and children and almost half of the admissions to-date have been minors, with almost 85% of this figure aged under 12.</p><p>The numbers, date of arrival and nationality of the unaccompanied minors are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Table of admission of UAMs</b><table><tr><th>Arrival Month in Ireland</th><th>Country from which Relocated</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>October 2016</td><td>Greece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>December 2016</td><td>Greece</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>January 2017</td><td>France</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>March 2017</td><td>France</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>April 2017</td><td>Greece</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>June 2017</td><td>France</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>August 2017</td><td>France</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>September 2017</td><td>France</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>32</td></tr></table></p><p>The original country of origin of the 32 unaccompanied minors is as follows:</p><p>Afghanistan: 15</p><p>South Sudan: 4</p><p>Eritrea: 6</p><p>Syria: 7</p><p>Total: 32</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs introduced the AIM model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) provides supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.   </p>  <p>  It is the AIM policy that requests for equipment or appliances will only be accepted from healthcare professionals (such as an occupational therapist or physiotherapist) working for or on behalf of the HSE.  This reflects the holistic, integrated approach recommended in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group, whereby services and supports would be prescribed and provided in a joined-up, child-centered way by a multi-disciplinary HSE team, i.e. it should support a situation where the same team is assessing and considering the child's needs across the home, pre-school and other settings.  This approach also takes account of important guiding principles of equity and 'needs-driven' which underpin the model, i.e. access to supports under the model should not be affected by ability to pay.  </p>  <p>  However I understand that an application was requested under AIM Level 7 - requesting funding for additional support, and this was approved. DCYA have also requested that the application should be diverted to the HSE under AIM Level 6 - HSE Therapy Supports, in order that this child may be assessed for any equipment that may be deemed essential for his participation in the ECCE pre-school room.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Of the additional 1,550 new mental health posts approved since 2012, some 1,150 have been, or are in the process of being recruited.</p>  <p>  Construction has started on the new 120-bed hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, along with a new 10-bed forensic CAMHS unit and a new 10-bed Mental Health Intellectual Disability Unit. The new National Forensic Mental Health facility is due to become operational in early 2020. </p>  <p>  Counselling services across both primary and secondary care have also been developed, including the provision of three new Jigsaw youth mental health services in Cork (2 sites), Dublin (2 sites) and Limerick (1 site).  In addition, funding has been provided for the recruitment of an additional 22 psychologist posts and 114 assistant psychology posts in primary care.  These posts were advertised recently.</p>  <p>  The Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014, with the objective of increasing awareness, ensuring early diagnosis and intervention and developing enhanced community based services.  </p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, the Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5 million, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12 million and the HSE &euro;15.5 million.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1.23 million has recently been secured under the 2017 Dormant Accounts Action Plan  to support a number of  dementia projects. These  include post-diagnostic supports, dementia friendly communities, assistive technology libraries  and further exploratory work on the development of a national dementia registry. These measures will help people  with dementia to live well in their communities for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond. The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process. The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.</p></reply>

The first public meeting of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, chaired by Senator Catherine Noone, was on 20 September.  The Committee is to report its conclusions and recommendations to both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of its first public meeting, which would therefore be due on or before 20 December 2017.  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s report will then be debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Government has agreed to hold a referendum on the Eighth Amendment in May or June 2018 subject to the timely passage of a Constitutional Amendment Bill on the matter by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme. Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans. In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers who are skilled in using these machines. In this context, it is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access anomaly scans.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

A prescriber may, on occasion, request that patients are only supplied with one week's supply of medicine at a time, due to the nature of the medicines involved and/or any ongoing safety concerns for the patient. In such circumstances, the prescription would be required to be dispensed by the pharmacy on a weekly basis, and this would be governed by the particular patient's care needs. This is known as phased dispensing and a fee is paid to a pharmacist for this service. </p><p>Claims by pharmacists for phased dispensing fees are only valid in certain narrow circumstances, where the dispensing on multiple supply occasions is:</p><p>- at the request of a patient's physician;</p><p>- due to the inherent nature of the medicine in terms of product stability and shelf life;</p><p>- where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regimen;</p><p>- in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.</p></reply>

Staff from both my own Department as well as Teagasc were in the area; Teagasc provided advice to affected farmers in dealing with the immediate challenges that arose.</p><p>From my own experience of visiting Inishowen, together with the findings of my officials and Teagasc, it was clear that the principal and most widespread impacts of the floods on farms in the Inishowen Peninsula centred on damage to land, fencing, fodder and livestock. To address these pressing issues in the most effective manner I introduced a targeted measure of assistance.</p><p>Support under this measure applies to losses of livestock, conserved fodder (Hay or Silage) and as a contribution towards the clean-up cost of agricultural lands, including repair to fences, damaged by debris washed up by the floods.  The measure is subject to the provisions of EU de minimis state aid rules in the agriculture sector and only losses not covered by insurance are eligible for consideration. </p><p>While it is not possible to address all of the problems the unprecedented rainfall caused on farms in Inishowen, this measure is in my view, a most comprehensive, timely and appropriate response to the main difficulties farmers there had to deal with.</p><p>The measure closed for applications last Friday 29<sup>th</sup>September and these will now be processed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

This mortality was however, multifactorial in nature and it is not possible to quantify the losses which were specifically attributed to jellyfish.</p><p>- Two other sites located adjacent to each other also in Co. Donegal, reported gill and skin lesions similar to those caused by zooplankton, in August.  Significant gill pathology was identified on one site, whilst minor skin lesions were identified on the other. As these were harvest size fish, mortalities were avoided by accelerating their harvest. </p><p>2015</p><p>- One site in Co. Donegal reported that jellyfish related mortality had occurred in October/November when the loss of 145,000 fish was recorded.</p><p>2016</p><p>- One site in Co. Cork reported that a generation of fish which went to sea in November 2014 experienced 3.3% mortality during the period up to harvest in October 2016.</p><p>2017</p><p>-  Four aquaculture sites reported jellyfish related mortalities between Weeks 32 and 39</p><blockquote>(i.e  from week beginning August 7<sup>th</sup>to week beginning September 25<sup>th</sup>). Three of these sites are located in Co. Galway and one is located in Co. Cork. Weekly mortality rates recorded during that period ranged from 2-19% in the southwest and from 1-80% in the west. </blockquote><p>The welfare and survival of farmed fish which have suffered mortality due to an influx of jellyfish onto an aquaculture site, represents an acute episode, the management of which is overseen and directed by the operator&rsquo;s private veterinary practitioner. The ongoing health and welfare of farmed fish on a given site is overseen by the veterinary practitioner who is named in the health management plan that the operator supplies to the Marine Institute as part of the Fish Health Authorisation process.  This care and direction is carried out in compliance with normal veterinary standards and within the parameters set out in the Farmed Salmonid Health Handbook, a document which was launched in 2011 and which supports an industry/ government backed Code of Good Practice. This approach is consistent with the requirements of SI No 261 of 2008 (European Communities (Health of Aquaculture Animals and Products) Regulations 2008 (as amended).</p></reply>

The Map is searchable by eircode.</p><p>- The BLUE areas on the Map represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering, or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The AMBER areas on the Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of a procurement process. </p><p>The map provides  information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county.  There are over 2.3 million premises in Ireland of which approximately 542,000 premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map.  Information on county coverage including townland statistics in each area is available on my Department's website. </p><p>The position in relation to the areas referred to in the Deputies Questions is as follows:</p><p>- The map shows that the townland of Ballinterry Co Cork comprises 13 premises and broadband coverage will be realised  through a mix of commercial investment and through the State Intervention under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). Of the 13 premises, 9 fall within the State Intervention area while the remaining 4 of these premises fall within eir's 300k planned rural deployment. </p><p>- There are over 90,000 premises in County Kildare of which over 13,000 fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP. The remaining c.77,000 premises fall within a BLUE area and will be covered by commercial operators, of which c.7,000 premises form part of eir&rsquo;s planned rural deployment to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018.</p><p>The eircode of the premise will indicate whether the premises will be covered commercially or be part of the State led Intervention. Individuals can access the High Speed Broadband Map <i><i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i></i>using their eircode to ascertain the colour code (BLUE or AMBER) status for their premises.</p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at <i><i></i></i>.  Citizens can access this website to determine the connectivity availability status for their premises using their eircode.  The website also provides a list of retail service providers who offer services using high speed fibre network in the area.  </p><p>My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. A significant milestone in that procurement process was reached last week with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders. This is the last stage of the procurement process before receipt of final tenders and ultimate progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s).</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the rollout of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area, I established a Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. </p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 Megabits per second when the procurement process for the State led intervention is completed and the network rolled out.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their level in 2005.  This will be Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the overall EU objective to reduce its emissions by the order of 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  Ireland&rsquo;s target is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated to EU Member States under this Decision, which is shared only with Denmark and Luxembourg.  </p>  <p>  The latest projections for greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July of this year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Although this first Plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework governing the EU&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reductions targets includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using our banked emissions from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2018.  However, our cumulative emissions are expected to exceed targets for 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis will be required to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p></reply>

The regulation of telecommunications service providers generally, including allocating radio spectrum for mobile telephone services, the imposition of binding conditions and regulatory issues surrounding mobile phone network coverage and quality, in accordance with procurement or licensing conditions, are functions of ComReg.</p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland. To maintain momentum, I established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This group will report on progress every 90 days. The Implementation Group has met twice this year, in March and July, and is due to meet again in October. Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which are available on my Department's website. These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions. I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.</p>  <p>  A stakeholder forum will take place in Athlone later this week, to take stock of progress made in implementing the Taskforce actions and to enable discussion on all the issues impacting on the rollout of telecoms infrastructure. It will also inform the review to be conducted prior to completion of an annual report by the Implementation Group at end 2017.</p>  <p>  This work will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, following Regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in lots covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The very significant commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, with at least one operator now having in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

These changes are projected to continue and increase over the coming decades and include temperature rise, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns.   The policy responses to climate change are two-fold:</p>  <p>  - Mitigation of emissions of the greenhouse gases that are driving climate change</p>  <p>  - Adaptation to the impacts of climate change</p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 provides for the preparation of plans covering both mitigation and adaptation with the purpose of transitioning to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. In responding to the low carbon challenge I published Ireland&rsquo;s first &ldquo;National Mitigation Plan&rdquo; on 19 July 2017 and under section 5 of the Act, my Department must also submit to Government for approval a National Adaptation Framework not later than 10 December 2017. A draft version of the Framework is currently out for public consultation which is scheduled to close on 27 October 2017.</p>  <p>  The policy in relation to adaptation was first set out in Ireland&rsquo;s 2012 non-statutory &ldquo;National Climate Change Adaptation Framework&rdquo; and subsequently restated in the &ldquo;National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development&rdquo;. Under the 2015 Act, the new National Adaptation Framework is to specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors and by local authorities in their administrative areas in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to avail of any positive effects that may occur. Relevant Ministers will be required to develop sectoral adaptation plans which will specify the adaptation policy measures they propose to adopt.    </p>  <p>  A number of resources are already in place to assist with adaptation planning including the web resource "Climate Ireland", forthcoming &ldquo;Sectoral Guidelines for Planning for Climate Change Adaptation&rdquo; and the 2016 &ldquo;Local Authority Climate Change Adaptation Strategy Guidelines&rdquo;. Some sectors, that is Agriculture and Forestry, Transport, Energy and Flood Risk Management, have already developed plans under the 2012 Framework, while Local Government is currently examining how a regional approach might be developed to address local/regional effects. A National Adaptation Steering Committee, chaired by my Department, was established under the 2012 Framework, and includes representation from key sectors and agencies. The work of this committee and its future deliberations under the new Framework will ensure appropriate levels of coordination across the relevant sectors so as to facilitate an effective transition to a climate resilient economy.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter target also being legally binding. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 27.1% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.0% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2016. Overall, SEAI analysis shows that 9.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2016 were met from renewable sources. While good progress is being made, meeting our 2020 targets will be challenging.</p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid is 3,400 MW approximately, of which 3,080 MW is wind generation. It is estimated that a total of between 3,900 MW and 4,300 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Given that we have 3,400 MW in place, we will need approximately a further 500 MW to 900 MW of additional renewable generation to meet our 2020 targets. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes in place  or under development designed to stimulate further progress in the domestic renewable energy sector. These include the Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes for the electricity sector and the Biofuel Obligation Scheme in the transport sector. These schemes have proved successful at incentivising large-scale investment in the renewable industry in recent years. </font></p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">My Department is also currently developing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme, designed to encourage further investment in the renewable electricity and heat sectors, respectively.  A public consultation on the design principles of the proposed new RESS is currently underway and submissions are invited from the public. The introduction of any schemes - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - are subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. </font></p><p>In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution. The Biofuels Obligation Scheme (BOS) was increased from 6% to 8% by volume from 1 January 2017.  A public consultation on future increases to the Biofuel Obligation Scheme, required to meet the 2020 renewable transport target will take place later this year.</p></reply>

Collectors of waste must conduct their activities in accordance with the relevant legislation and the conditions of their waste collection permits which require that waste is managed in line with the waste hierarchy. Enforcement of waste collection permit conditions is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p><p>Waste Management planning, including infrastructure provision, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act, 1996. The three Waste Management Planning Lead Authorities monitor on an on-going basis the generation and management nationally of municipal solid waste and other waste streams. Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.</p><p>The Government's policy of increasing the landfill levy to its current level of &euro;75 per tonne has provided a real financial incentive for operators to divert as much material as possible from being disposed of at landfill. The application of this economic instrument has ensured that it is in the financial interest of collectors, who are competing for market share, to encourage effective recycling in an effort to minimise costs for operators and customers alike.</p><p>The success of the above policy and legislative measures to encourage waste prevention, preparation for re-use, recycling and other recovery has meant that  more waste can be put to environmentally sustainable and productive use as opposed to being buried in the ground. The statistics show that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time in terms of improving our recycling rates. In this regard, <i>National Waste Statistics - Reports and Bulletins </i>are available to download at <i><i></i></i>including the recently published table on <i>Progress towards EU waste recycling, recovery and diversion targets.</i></p><p>My role as Minister is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the relevant regulatory bodies, such as the local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency, operate. The waste collection system is subject to a number of regulatory controls, including the Waste Management Act, 1996 as amended and the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2007, S.I. No. 820 of 2007, as amended. In the interest of encouraging further waste prevention, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection will be phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. It is worth noting that the measure to phase out flat fees is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee.</p><p>To assist householders in managing their waste, the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices commenced a programme of education and awareness funded by my  Department earlier this year with radio advertisements encouraging the use of the brown bin and focusing on food waste prevention. This was backed up with social media campaigns to further encourage the use of the brown bin. The Regional Waste Management Planning Offices will continue to roll out waste awareness and education initiatives this year, re-focussing on the use of the brown bin, but also concentrating on improving and increasing recycling, waste prevention and the correct use of the kerbside collection system. My Department is also undertaking an awareness campaign to inform people about the phase out of flat rate fees, which began during the summer and will continue this year.</p></reply>

The rates of duty for half-yearly and quarterly motor tax are set at a higher rate than a pro-rata proportion of the annual rate of duty.  The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and my own Department, which operates the online motor tax system, as well as the resultant administrative, banking and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices.  Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedure as the annual renewal process.  Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period. </p>  <p>  While motor tax policy is a matter for the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, I understand, based on motor tax receipts in 2016, receipts from the surcharge associated with the half-yearly and quarterly options was &euro;55.4m, and accordingly the cost of abolishing the surcharge would be likely to be of that order in a full year.  The loss of income that would arise from changing the current arrangements, whether at setting motor tax at a pro-rata rate or introducing a lower percentage additional charge, would have a negative impact on the total collected via motor tax and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or through the taxation system generally.  The basis of charging for half-yearly and quarterly discs is provided for in secondary legislation.     </p>  <p>  Data compiled by the Controller and Auditor General Report for a recent report on the &lsquo;Administration and Collection of Motor Tax&rsquo; found that the average cost of a motor tax transaction in a motor tax office (over the counter) as being just over &euro;10, and the cost of an online transaction being just under &euro;5.</p></reply>

Given the many different uses for phones and the various options for hands-free use of phones, a significant body of work is required to adequately legislate for this behaviour. While I am focused on progressing the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 through the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have also asked my officials to commence work in this area with a view to progressing it in the context of the next Road Traffic Bill. </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the statutory non-commercial body tasked with undertaking strategic planning of transport, investing in all public transport infrastructure and developing the effective management of traffic and transport demand for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) was established through a merger of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency under the Roads Act 2015, with effect from 01/08/15.  The TII's primary function is to provide an integrated approach to the future development and operation of the national roads network and light rail infrastructure throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the amended Dublin Transport Act 2008, the NTA is responsible for the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), 2016-2035 which I adopted in April 2016 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Strategy will guide decisions on transport throughout the region and will contribute to the economic, social and cultural progress of the GDA (counties Dublin, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare) by providing for the efficient, effective and sustainable movement of people and goods.  The NTA is also responsible for submitting observations to the relevant Minister on whether it believes draft local development plans and proposed variations to local development plans are consistent with its transport strategy. </p>  <p>  The Government recently published for public consultation &ldquo;Ireland 2040 &ndash; Our Plan&rdquo;, which will guide national, regional and local planning opportunities throughout Ireland together with investment decisions for at least the next two decades.  The enhanced development of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities is fundamental to Ireland 2014, requiring a strongly co-ordinated focus within the metropolitan functional areas on a range of key issues. The planning and strategic development policies set out in Ireland 2040 will better support the development of an integrated and sustainable public transport system.</p></reply>

Items of the identity dataset that are verified include the date and place of birth as well as the mother&rsquo;s birth surname.  This information is taken from the birth registration record, or in the case of adopted persons, from the adoption registration record.  A PSC is issued following successful completion of the registration process. </p><p>For Irish-born nationals, the SAFE registration officers in my Department have direct electronic access to the birth register and so can usually verify these data items without the need for a person to bring their birth cert.  </p><p>However, as the Adopted Children Register is maintained centrally in the General Register Office, all requests for certificates relating to adoptions must be made to that office.  Consequently, adopted persons are asked to bring their adoption certificate (not their birth certificate) with them when they attend for SAFE registration.

As part of Budget 2017, the funding for the scheme was substantially increased this year by an additional &euro;5.5 million which will benefit over 50,000 additional children from September 2017 bringing the total number of schools in the scheme to some 1,700 and the number of children supported to up to 250,000. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The recently published nutrition standards for school meals, under the auspices of Healthy Ireland, will be a valuable resource to enable and promote healthy eating and healthy lifestyles in schools. These standards will compliment and strengthen the support and controls already in place.</p>  <p>  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding under the school meals scheme in advance of each school year and list the food items to be provided for each food club on their application. Detailed records must be submitted at the end of each school year. Expenditure on items that do not meet the standards will be deducted from the following year's funding allocation. In addition, the Department initiated an on-site inspection programme in 2012 in participating schools to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to. The inspection process is being rolled out across all schools and includes an assessment of the type of food provided. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>It is envisaged that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months and tendering to engage consultants to carry out that process is currently underway.  In light of the SEA requirements, it is expected that the Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until  2018.  In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.</p><p>In relation to solar farms, there are no specific planning guidelines in place. Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p><p>I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments. However, the matter will be kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department - which leads on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p></reply>

Details of these projects are available at the following link: http://rebuildingireland.ie/news/social-housing-schemes-2017/. </p>  <p>  The timing and delivery of these projects is a matter in the first place for Sligo County Council. I understand from the Council that the project at Carrowbunaun faces a number of challenges in relation to negotiations with third parties, site access, road alignment and waste water infrastructure, all of which have impacted on the project's advancement.  I understand that the Councillors have been briefed by officials on these issues.  There is no question in relation to my Department's funding support for this or other projects; all costs incurred as the project is advanced through design and planning, and onto construction, can and will be met as soon as they arise and I am keen that the project progresses as speedily as possible.  </p>  <p>  While the project at Carrowbunaun faces a number of challenges, I understand that Sligo County Council is working on additional construction proposals to further strengthen their delivery pipeline, as well as taking proactive steps to deliver social housing through other initiatives to address its housing need.  In 2016 and to date in 2017, around 100 vacant social homes have been returned to productive use by Sligo County Council and 48 new social homes have been acquired.  Additional staffing resources were approved in 2016 for Sligo County Council&rsquo;s Housing Unit to accelerate delivery of their social housing and regeneration programmes.</p>  <p>  In relation to addressing project delays, I recently announced a number of outcomes arising from the first phase of my review of Rebuilding Ireland.  These include a commitment that Minister of State English will lead a new delivery team in my Department to work with local authorities and approved housing bodies. I anticipate this team will focus in on accelerating social housing construction projects to ensure that, notwithstanding the genuine challenges that arise with construction projects of all types, progress is made to ensure delivery as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

It is generated using the actual rent figures provided when registering with the RTB.</p>  <p>  Recent legislation established rent pressure zones in certain areas and laid out the process through which further rent pressure zones can be established.  To enable the designation of rent pressure zones at a more granular level, the RTB, working with the ESRI, has developed a methodology to provide rental price information at a more local level, enabling the designation of Local Electoral Areas (LEA) as rent pressure zones as well as improving the Index more generally and providing a more detailed and useful picture of the performance of the rental sector.  The information collected by the RTB provides a robust basis for implementing the Rent Pressure Zones and for monitoring their impact.</p>  <p>  As well as information on rent levels, the RTB's statistics on tenancy registrations and on its dispute resolution activities provide important information on the behaviour of the rental market and the impact of Government policies.  The role of the RTB is still evolving and will develop over the medium term and the range and quality of the information that it produces will increase.</p>  <p>  On 19 September, I announced that the RTB will be given the powers and resources to take on greater regulatory responsibility in the rental sector over the next two years.  As part of this change, the RTB will move towards annual registration of tenancies, which will permit the building of a national rent dataset, allowing the Board to provide benchmark rents for different property types.  This enhanced data will be key to understanding trends and behaviour in the rental market as well as informing future policy decisions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-04a.562.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017100400078#WRK01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 232, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Commissioned officers who joined the Permanent Defence Force on or after the 6th  April 1995 are, like other public servants appointed since then, insurable for full PRSI and so are entitled to the full range of Social Insurance benefits including the State Pension Contributory.  Both the employers and employees make PRSI contributions. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension is viewed as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The combined benefit from both sources &ndash; the occupational pension plus the State Pension &ndash; makes up the person&rsquo;s &lsquo;total pension&rsquo;.  On that basis, the employees&rsquo; occupational pensions are subject to a process &ndash; known as &ldquo;integration&rdquo; &ndash; whereby the occupational pension arrangements take account of entitlement to Social Insurance benefits (including the State Pension). </p>  <p>  Integration is a standard feature of public service pension schemes applicable to employees in full PRSI class who, whether joining the public service before or since April 1995, were subject to full PRSI. Integration does not apply to retirement gratuities.  Integration begins from the time the occupational pension comes into payment and operates on the assumption that a Social Insurance benefit is, in fact, payable.  However, except in cases of ill-health early retirement, Social Insurance benefits may actually not be payable until age 66 to 68 (depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth).  Under standard public service pension scheme arrangements for those who joined the public service before 1 January 2013 in full PRSI class, a &lsquo;supplementary pension&rsquo; may be payable in certain circumstances on compulsory retirement prior to State Pension age (66/68) in order to make up the shortfall in total pension in the interim. </p>  <p>  This supplementary pension is not payable automatically once a person reaches compulsory retirement age &ndash; such as age 60/65 in the wider public service &ndash; or some years earlier in the case of military personnel. Rather, the supplementary pension is payable only during periods in which the pensioner is (a) not in insurable employment; and (b) due to causes outside his or her control, fails to qualify for Social Welfare benefit / pension (or qualifies at a rate less than the maximum personal rate of State Pension).  The pensioner must meet these qualifying criteria to qualify for payment.  Therefore, the supplementary pension is not payable where a &lsquo;pre-January 2013&rsquo; public service pensioner is, subsequent to compulsory retirement &ndash; for example at age 58, 60 or 65 &ndash; working or employed in any capacity that involves a Social Insurance contribution.</p>  <p>  As I indicated to the House in my replies to Question No. 51 on 11 July 2017 and Question No. 2106 on 11 September 2017, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme was one of the key structural fiscal reform commitments agreed by Government with the EU/IMF in 2010 under the programme of financial support for Ireland.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the Single Scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the longer-term through far-reaching transformation and reform of the public service pension system.  It provides for a new approach which modernises and standardises pension arrangements throughout the public service.  The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to the superannuation arrangements of all public servants recruited before 1 January 2013 &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.  This position has been confirmed to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations.</p>  <p>  However, the absence of any provision for the supplementary pension concept in the Single Scheme must be viewed in the overall context of the fundamental changes and reforms to the pension scheme terms of post-2013 new entrants.  Such reforms were decided by Government and the Oireachtas as necessary to support the long-term financial sustainability of the public service pension system.  In that context, there are many other established features of the pre-1 January 2013 public service occupational pension arrangements that have been discontinued, or that have been fundamentally changed, under the Single Scheme.  Among the most notable of these changes is the introduction of career-average pension accrual under the Single Scheme, in place of the more costly final salary pension accrual applicable in the earlier &ldquo;pre-existing&rdquo; public service pension schemes.</p></reply>
