Several new hospices have opened and community specialist palliative care home care teams have been boosted. The HSE is working with local hospice groups in several locations, including the Midlands, to ensure equity of access to specialist palliative care across the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the HSE has given approval to fill the palliative care social worker post in Longford/Westmeath for a period of three years. North Westmeath Hospice has agreed to fund the post for the three year period. The post is currently with the HSE's National Recruitment Service and is expected to be filled early in 2017. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that the Chief Officer of CHO 8 has had a series of positive engagements with the Hospice organisations across the Midlands counties and has made progress on priorities such as the filling of social work and nursing posts in the specialist palliative care home care teams. A joint working group has also been established by CHO 8, the acute hospitals in the Midlands, and the national lead for palliative care to address the unique challenges the Midlands region faces in seeking to develop specialist palliative care. This joint working group will focus on developing staffing and capital resources in the Midlands in the coming years.</p></reply>

The HSE is committed to addressing  all Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service needs,  including the 16-18 age cohort. Using additional funding provided in recent years, the staffing and range of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams has been significantly expanded. This will continue in 2017 using the additional funding for mental health services recently announced in Budget 2017.</p><p>Community Healthcare Organisation Area 3 covers Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary and East Limerick. The most recent survey of the staffing of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services carried out in October 2016 recorded staffing at 53.7 whole time equivalents. A further 13 additional staff  are currently being recruited. <i>A Vision for Change,</i>recommended that there should be a total of 6  Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams in the Mid West area and I can confirm that there are 6 teams in the Mid West Mental Health Services. </p><p>The question of enhancing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, including teams in the Mid West, will be further examined in the context of finalisation of the Health Service Executive Service Plan for 2017 in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Primary Care Centres are an integral part of this because of the range of multi-disciplinary services they can provide and the role they can play in keeping people who don't need to be in an acute setting out of hospital.</p>  <p>  All potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered or provided or available, subject to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering healthcare services with HSE staff. The operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing and these factors are outside the control of the Health Service Executive. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that in Clondalkin, Primary Care Services are provided from three Health Centres - Boot Road, Rowlagh and Deansrath. In Lucan, Primary Care Services are provided from two Health Centres - Lucan Village and Rosse Court.</p>  <p>  The planning permission for the proposed Primary Care Centre in Lucan, which was to be delivered by the operational lease mechanism, was rejected on appeal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. As a result, the HSE has withdrawn the agreement for lease and is currently investigating alternative options for the provision of a Centre in the area.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Boot Road Health Centre site in Clondalkin was identified for redevelopment as a Primary Care Centre. However, following planning process delays and the preparation of detail design and tender documents, the developer, who also owns an adjoining site, was unable to source the required finance to develop the entire site, as intended.  A number of interested parties have contacted the HSE in relation to the development of a Centre for Clondalkin and I am confident that agreement to provide a new Primary Care Centre in the area will be achieved.</p>  <p>  The HSE will ensure that the services currently being delivered from the Boot Road Health Centre will continue to be delivered in the area until a new Primary Care Centre is developed.  </p>  <p>  The planned Primary Care Centre for Rowlagh and North Clondalkin, which is to be provided by direct build, is subject to planning permission being granted for the development.</p></reply>

These include the Clinical Research Facility, the upgrade of the Maternity Unit and the CF out-patient department.</p>  <p>  In addition, major developments currently underway include construction of a 75 bedded Clinical Ward Block and an Adult Acute Mental Health Unit. Planned developments include a Radiation Oncology Project, new Blood and Tissue laboratory facilities and replacement of the current cardiac catheterisation laboratories, CT Radiotherapy and Radiology facilities.</p>  <p>  Further, the Programme for a Partnership Government states that a new ED for UHG is currently being  designed with a view to funding for construction being provided as part of the 2017 Capital Plan Review. The Saolta University Healthcare Group has advised that a cost benefit analysis in respect of this project is being finalised.</p>  <p>  Given previous and on-going investment at the University Hospital Galway site, it would not represent value for money to develop a new hospital in the region.  Accordingly, further investment in particular hospitals will be considered based upon the strategic priorities put forward by the Saolta University Healthcare Group and the competing demands on the Acute Hospitals Infrastructure Programme nationally. </p>  <p>  The establishment of hospital groups provides opportunities to ensure that the most effective delivery of services is achieved across both the UHG and Merlin Park Hospital sites and that planning across sites ensures they are developed in line with the priority needs of the region.</p>  <p>  Discussions at my recent meeting focused in particular on the immediate priorities of a new Emergency Department and the 75 bed clinical ward block.</p></reply>

This Government is committed to a sustained focus on improving wait times, particularly for those waiting longest.</p>  <p>  The key issue is how long they wait. According to the September waiting list data published by the NTPF, 78% of patients on the outpatient waiting list for Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore are waiting less than 12 months for their appointment and nearly 89% are waiting less than 15 months.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the HSE and the NTPF to implement measures to reduce waiting times. At my request, in August, the HSE developed an action plan to reduce, by year end, the number of patients currently waiting 18 months or more for an impatient / daycase procedure.</p>  <p>  Also the NTPF is currently implementing an Endoscopy Initiative which aims to ensure that, by year end, no patient will be waiting 12 months or more for an endoscopy procedure. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, &euro;7m of the Winter Initiative funding is to be utilised to fund a targeted waiting list programme to provide treatment for patients waiting for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis procedures.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. Planning of this initiative is at an advanced stage by the NTPF, my Department and the HSE.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  Engagements to date have seen the Department of Health, HSE and IMO agree a number of service developments including: the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes; an enhanced support framework for rural GPs, which is expected to double the number of qualifying GPs to about 330; and a revised list of special items of service under the contract to encourage the provision of more services in the primary care setting. These measures, combined with the under-6s and over-70s initiatives, will increase the financial support for general practice. </p>  <p>  Preparations for the next phase of discussions on a new GP contract are under way. These discussions will address a wide range of issues, including the role of GPs in delivering chronic care within the community. I expect that further engagement with GP representative bodies on these matters will take place this year. As with any negotiation-type process, the engagement may take some time. While I am of course anxious to see good progress made, it is not my intention to set a deadline for completion of discussions.</p></reply>

The HSE has reported an overall increase of approx. 5% in patient attendances at EDs nationally this year and an increase of 2% in attendances at the ED in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  It is essential that in the coming winter, every effort is made by hospitals to ensure that patients attending EDs experience a safer, better quality service provided in the most appropriate setting.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that Portlaoise Hospital has developed a wide range of measures to assist in managing capacity pressures in the hospital.  This includes an escalation system, which is in place during periods of increased activity, for effective management of beds where elderly patients and patients at risk are prioritised.  The hospital has a Winter Capacity Plan to assist in managing the demand for services over the winter period. </p>  <p>  The appointment of an Assistant Director of Nursing for Patient Flow will also assist in ensuring the optimal use of available beds in the hospital and facilitate timely patient flow.  This appointment is expected shortly. In addition, the recruitment of an Advanced Nurse Practitioner will improve experience time in ED for patients with minor injuries. This post is currently being progressed by the National Recruitment Service.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Hospital also works closely with the community health colleagues to maximise and prioritise access to long stay and intermediate care beds to ensure timely discharge of patients to the most appropriate setting.</p></reply>

The Framework ensures that designated managers are explicitly and personally accountable for managing the performance of services within their allocated budget. Accountable officers are named for each Hospital Group, for each Community Health Organisation, for the National Ambulance Service,  for the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, and  for the Nursing Home Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  Key features of the Accountability Framework are the formal Performance Agreements which are in place at two levels. The first level is the National Director Performance Agreement between the Director General and each National Director.  The second level is between the Hospital Group CEO's and the National Director of Acute Hospitals and between the Community Health Organisation Chief Officer's and the National Directors for community services.  National Directors are accountable for the delivery of their Divisional component of the National Service Plan and this is  reflected in each Performance Agreement. The HSE has allocated maximum expenditure levels to Accountable Officers and they are now fully responsible and accountable for managing the performance of services and resources including staffing levels within their allocated budget. Accountable Officers are required to prepare a financial plan in line with their Performance Agreement with the National Director setting out  the actions they will take to meet the agreed performance targets within the financial allocation. This is required to be signed off by both the Accountable Officer and their senior manager. </p>  <p>In the context of the Performance and Accountability Framework underperformance includes performance that  places patients or service users at risk, fails to meet the required standards for that service or   departs from what is considered normal practice. It is important to note that accountability encompasses performance in the areas of service access, quality, finance and human resources and evaluation of performance. Managers are expected to lead the improvement of performance across all dimensions. Flexibility regarding the utilisation of resources exists within the agreed expenditure levels. The Performance and Accountability Framework provides for the HSE to closely monitor the delivery of services in accordance with the agreed targets and within the agreed financial allocation and for the HSE to take appropriate steps in terms of support and/or intervention as and when the need arises.</p></reply>

This included an approximate additional 1,150  new posts recruited since 2012.  A total of  approximately 1,550 were approved but not all posts could be filled due to staff recruitment and retention challenges. However, recruitment to posts approved up to the current year is continuing, and this will continue to narrow the gap between existing staffing levels and the 10,650 WTE posts recommended under <i>A Vision for Change.</i></p><p>The new posts filled in recent years have been directed towards increasing the staffing of adult and Child and Adolescent  Mental Health Service teams (CAMHS)  in every Community Healthcare Organisation area. There are currently 114 adult teams and  67 CAMHS teams, including 3  Paediatric Liaison teams supported by 66 operational CAMHS beds across the country.  New posts have also been allocated towards improved forensic services and for several specialist areas including, Eating Disorders and Psychiatry of Old Age.  In addition, funding was set aside in the 2016 National Service Plan to develop early intervention services at Primary Care level, in conjunction with the Mental Health Services, along with significantly increased funding for expansion of Jigsaw services in 5 new locations. </p><p>I am committed to continuing to fund our mental health services. I am initiating &euro;35 million in new services in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 Service Plan include youth mental health, further improvement to child &amp;amp; adolescent and adult services, older people's services and further enhanced out of hours response for those in need of urgent services. Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be some &euro;15 million.  There will also be a further additional spend in mental health associated with increased pay rates. </p><p>In addition, I have secured additional capital funding of approximately &euro;50 million  for 2017, to commence the construction of the long-planned new National Forensic Mental Health Campus at Portrane.  Despite a significant increase in costs for this project since it was originally initiated in 2000, due mainly to price inflation in the construction sector, I have obtained Government support to proceed with the award of tender. When completed, this project will significantly modernise our forensic services.  </p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours cooperatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.   </p>  <p>  In the Mid West region, the out-of-hours arrangements are discharged through Shannondoc, a not-for-profit GP cooperative, which is funded by the HSE. Shannondoc has recently announced that due to a difficulty in attracting GPs, and in particular locum cover, it is no longer able to maintain its existing service across all its centres.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Shannondoc, the HSE, in order to ensure the sustainability of the service, accepted a proposal from the cooperative to changes in the provision of the service.  The most significant changes relate to part of East and West Clare, essentially affecting Ennistymon, Kilrush, and Killaloe with minor changes in terms of operating hours in two locations in North Tipperary.   </p>  <p>  The recent changes to the Shannondoc out-of-hours services will be subject to a three-monthly review and their impact will be closely monitored and evaluated by the HSE.</p></reply>

There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts. The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts. The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns. The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives. In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 is available to nurses who return from overseas. </p>  <p>  There has been an increase of over 1,160 nurses employed in the public health service (34,375 to 35,538) from August 2014 to August 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014. The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest ever health budget, and this will allow for the filling of an additional 1,000 nursing posts.</p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates. Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.</p>  <p>  In the past week the Government has approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th   year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates. This decision means that all nurses and midwives will have incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year. It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p><p>It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p><p>Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p><p>It is important that people with medical needs should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 110,453 as of 1 September this year. This followed the measures announced by my predecessor Minister Varadkar, when the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility</i>was published.  The &quot;Keane&quot; Report found that it is not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. On foot of the publication of the report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and demonstrates the HSE's commitment to the development of a medical system which is responsive and considerate  of an applicant's particular circumstances.</p></reply>

The review was undertaken by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected, Belfast based NHS cardiologist. It is a comprehensive report which reflects the fact that Dr Herity consulted widely and met with all of the key stakeholders including the management and staff of both UHW and Cork University Hospital. Both the views of my Department and the HSE on the investment priorities for the South/South West Hospital Group fed into the review, as did their views on the sustainability of a second Cath Lab in the context of international guidance on population levels and procedure numbers. </p>  <p>   Dr Herity has made clear recommendations that a second cardiac cath lab at UHW is not justified and I accept this. However, he recommends investing in UHW to enhance the existing cardiology services including increasing the number of weekly sessions currently provided, in order to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients. He also recommends that new specialist equipment be provided to improve contingency for radiological equipment failure during a procedure. I am happy to provide the additional resources necessary to implement these recommendations. This investment will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan for 2017. During this period of investment and enhancement of services, the situation will be closely monitored. A review will be carried out in early 2017 to assess the impact that these improvements have had on the volume of patients attending the cath lab.</p>  <p>   Dr Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere. I want to be certain that any change to how a service is delivered will result in improved services for the patients using that service. Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access to a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack. I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017. </p>  <p>  I intend to visit UHW next month and I will take the opportunity to speak with staff and management on a broad range of issues.</p></reply>

The principles captured in the Agreement will also be extended to non-IPHA suppliers of branded medicines, leading to additional expected savings in the region of &euro;150 million.</p>  <p>  The new Agreement contains a number of features which represent clear additional value over the terms of the previous 2012 Agreement. The reference basket of countries used to set prices in Ireland has been expanded from 9 to 14 countries and, importantly, includes lower cost countries. For the first time, the Agreement provides for an annual price realignment, which will ensure that the prices of medicines in Ireland reduce in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  This will ensure the State achieves better value for money on the cost of medicines as prices in other basket countries are adjusted downwards over time. In addition, the Agreement secured a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market. </p>  <p>  Another important initiative is the on-going implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing.  To date 47 substances have been included in this process and I have recently requested that the Health Products Regulatory Authority review an additional 15 substances.  The implementation of generic substitution and reference pricing delivered &euro;47m in savings in 2014 and &euro;94m in savings in 2015. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are committed to driving further efficiencies and savings on the cost of medicines for the State.   Establishing a new Community Pharmacy, Dental, Optical and Aural Policy unit in the Department is bringing a renewed focus to the development of policy in relation to community pharmacy and the issues associated with achieving maximum benefit to patients.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has also recently established a Drugs Management Portfolio, which includes a range of projects to optimise value in the primary care and hospital settings.  The Portfolio also includes the work of the HSE's Medicines Management Programme which introduced the preferred drugs initiative to facilitate more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines.  It continues to engage with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing including generic prescribing.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the prices of medicines vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.</p></reply>

Biosimilar medicines are similar but not identical to their reference biological medicines, and therefore are not considered in the same way as generic medicines. Under the Heath (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, biosimilars are not considered to be interchangeable, and therefore cannot be substituted for biological medicines.</p>  <p>  It is likely that the use of biosimilar medicines will grow in Ireland in the coming years as the patents on biological medicines expire, offering opportunities for the State to make further savings on the cost of medicines.  The recently signed  Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines 2016-2020 with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association includes a provision to take advantage of these new developments in the pharmaceutical industry.  Under the new Agreement the price of a biologic medicine will be reduced by 20% and an additional rebate of 12.5% provided upon entry into the market of a biosimilar.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently assessing the whole area of biosimilar medicines and are developing a biosimilar policy. They will be working with the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the HSE to progress this agenda and will be examining the need for legislative changes in this area.  It is useful to note that the HSE's Medicines Management Programme issued a position paper earlier this year supporting the appropriate introduction of biosimliars into clinical use in Ireland.  </p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague, Minister  for Education and Skills. </p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m was provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available. </p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the issues he has raised.</p></reply>

This was welcomed by the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists.  </p><p>Last month, the Physiotherapists Registration Board established its register under the Act with effect from 30 September 2016.  This ensures that the specified title of <i>physiotherapist</i>will be protected for the exclusive use of registrants when the register&rsquo;s two-year transitional period ends in September 2018.  </p><p>Earlier this year, my predecessor, Leo Varadkar T.D., having consulted with relevant parties, concluded that protecting the title of <i>physical therapist</i>under the Act as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist</i>would be the best way to eliminate the ongoing risk of title confusion and the consequent risks to public safety. He also decided to allow particular existing users of the title of <i>physical therapist</i>, who are not physiotherapists but who hold qualifications of a certain standard, to continue to use the title. </p><p>New grand-parenting provisions will allow such practitioners to apply, on a once-off basis and for a limited period, to register in the physiotherapists register, confining their practise to musculoskeletal therapies.</p><p>Preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to these decisions is now at an advanced stage.  The legislation will involve the making of regulations under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 in tandem with the enactment of necessary amendments to that Act to allow existing qualified title users to continue to use the title.  It is my intention to seek Government approval to include these amendments to the Act in a Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.</p></reply>

This has focused on additional funding for homecare in particular and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  Since the Government took Office, we have significantly increased the funding available for homecare.  An additional &euro;40m (including &euro;10m as part of the forthcoming Winter initiative) already provided in 2016 represented an increase of over 13% in the total funding available, and means that the number of Home Care Packages provided this year will increase from 15,450 to 15,800 and home help hours from 10.4million to 10.57 million.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative will also provide another &euro;1.4m for homecare this year which will provide a further 650 Packages by year's end.  These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals to allow people to be discharged home quickly.  Over 2016 the number of Home care Packages being provided will have increased by 1,000.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;14.6m of the Winter Initiative will be to fund homecare, and there will be another &euro;3.8m to maintain existing levels of service and &euro;10m for new developments.  Details of the services to be provided with these funds will be set out in the coming weeks in the forthcoming HSE 2017 National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Demand for homecare has increased significantly in recent years and this is a continuing trend.  This is due to a number of factors including long-run demographic trends, an increased desire on the part of many older people to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and continuing requirements to support discharges from acute hospitals.  The resources available for homecare came under severe pressure in recent years because of the wider economic environment, and this, coupled with the other factors that I have already mentioned means that we have a good deal of ground to make up.  I think we have made a very substantive start to that process but it will take some time to get to where we would ideally want to be in terms of home care services.</p></reply>

This has focused on additional funding for homecare in particular and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  Since the Government took Office, we have significantly increased the funding available for homecare.  An additional &euro;40m (including &euro;10m as part of the forthcoming Winter initiative) already provided in 2016 represented an increase of over 13% in the total funding available, and means that the number of Home Care Packages provided this year will increase from 15,450 to 15,800 and home help hours from 10.4million to 10.57 million.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative will also provide another &euro;1.4m for homecare this year which will provide a further 650 Packages by year's end.  These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals to allow people to be discharged home quickly.  Over 2016 the number of Home care Packages being provided will have increased by 1,000.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;14.6m of the Winter Initiative will be to fund homecare, and there will be another &euro;3.8m to maintain existing levels of service and &euro;10m for new developments.  Details of the services to be provided with these funds will be set out in the coming weeks in the forthcoming HSE 2017 National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Homecare services are provided either directly by the HSE or through service agreements with private and voluntary sector providers.  Approximately 85% of Home Help is provided directly by the HSE and not for profit providers.  It is estimated that approximately 60% of the HCP service is delivered by arrangement with external providers. </p>  <p>  From the 1st September 2016 all new Home Care Packages approved by the HSE will be provided by organisations that have been approved by the HSE following a detailed tender process.  The approved list of home care providers is available at www.hse.ie/homecarepackageproviders.</p></reply>

In addition, a further &euro;50 million will be provided for the construction of the new national forensic mental health service in Portrane.</p>  <p>  The figure of &euro;851.3 million represents approximately 6% of the total Health Budget of &euro;14.2 billion.</p>  <p>  The total Budget for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland is &pound;4.88 billion (as at January 2016).  According to Northern Ireland's Minister for Health, Michelle O'Neill (in an Assembly debate on Mental Health on 28th June 2016), the budget for Mental Health is now &pound;250 million.  This is approximately 5.2% of the total Health Budget for Northern Ireland.  It is difficult, however, to compare the two sets of figures, since there are differences in the compilation of each, reflecting varying composition of services and funding in the two jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  'A Vision for Change' , published in 2006, sets out a 10 year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended a requirement for additional ongoing funding of &euro;151 million over the next seven years.  Since that time, significant progress has been made. </p>  <p>  In 2012, the Mental Health budget was &euro;711 million.  In 2017, it will rise to &euro;851.3 million, an increase of &euro;140 million, or almost 20%, over this period.  Overall, approximately 1,550 new posts have been approved for the mental health services since 2012 with approximately 1,000 posts filled to date although some existing posts in that time have also been lost due to retirements and normal attrition.</p>  <p>  'A Vision for Change' has guided national mental health policy for the past 10 years and its term ends this year.

A priority target is to address the needs of those waiting over 12 months, while maintaining targets for first appointments and seeing individuals within three months.  In addition, the Executive aims to improve the delivery of services in a more consistent and transparent manner, reflecting the identified clinical needs of the child.

The Department of Health, following a recent request for tender, will shortly confirm the award of a contract for an expert evidence review and analysis of national and international best practice in the development and delivery of mental health services.  The review aims to identify sites of best practice, outlining how these models can apply to the Irish context.  The review will also assess the current delivery of Mental Health Services in Ireland having regard to the international evidence and the implementation of 'A Vision for Change', and will have regard to both human rights and Health and Well-being objectives. </p>  <p>  This evidence review will inform the parameters of a review of 'A Vision for Change'.

This has focused on additional funding for home care in particular and is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  </p>  <p>  Since the Government took Office, we have significantly increased the funding available for home care.  An additional &euro;40m (including &euro;10m as part of the forthcoming Winter initiative) already provided in 2016 represented an increase of over 13% in the total funding available, and means that the number of Home Care Packages provided this year will increase from 15,450 to 15,800 and home help hours from 10.4 million to 10.57 million.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative will also provide another &euro;1.4m for home care this year which will provide a further 650 Packages by year's end. These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals to allow people to be discharged home quickly. Over 2016 the number of Home care Packages being provided will have increased by 1,000.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;14.6m of the Winter Initiative will be to fund home care, and there will be another &euro;3.8m to maintain existing levels of service and &euro;10m for new developments. Details of the services to be provided with these funds will be set out in the coming weeks in the forthcoming HSE 2017 National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Demand for home care has increased significantly in recent years and this is a continuing trend.  This is due to a number of factors including long-run demographic trends, an increased desire on the part of many older people to stay in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and continuing requirements to support discharges from acute hospitals.  The resources available for home care came under severe pressure in recent years because of the wider economic environment, and this, coupled with the other factors that I have already mentioned means that we have a good deal of ground to make up.  I think we have made a very substantive start to that process but it will take some time to get to where we would ideally want to be in terms of home care services.</p></reply>

A significant proportion of those availing of home care services are people with dementia. </p>  <p>  Since the Government took Office, we have significantly increased the funding available for home care. An additional &euro;40m (including &euro;10m as part of the forthcoming Winter initiative) already provided in 2016 represented an increase of over 13% in the total funding available, and means that the number of Home Care Packages provided this year increase from 15,450 to 15,800 and home help hours from 10.4 million to 10.57 million.</p>  <p>  The Winter Initiative will also provide another &euro;1.4m for home care this year which will provide a further 650 Packages by year's end.  These will be targeted at 10 specific hospitals to allow people to be discharged home quickly.  Over 2016 the number of Home care Packages being provided will have increased by 1,000.</p>  <p>  In 2017, &euro;14.6m of the Winter Initiative will be to fund home care, and there will be another &euro;3.8m to maintain existing levels of service and &euro;10m for new developments.  Details of the services to be provided with these funds will be set out in the coming weeks in the forthcoming HSE 2017 National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Programme, co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies, which accompanies the Irish National Dementia Strategy, includes the provision of Intensive Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week and 71 people are currently in receipt of such a package.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the Implementation Programme.  </p>  <p>  These Dementia-Specific Intensive Home Care Packages, together with mainstream home help and standard packages, will facilitate people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports to remain in their own homes and communities in accordance with the objectives of the National Dementia Strategy. </p></reply>

This Government is committed to a sustained focus on improving wait times, particularly for those waiting longest.</p>  <p>  While the numbers on waiting lists are undoubtedly too high, the key issue is how long people are waiting.  According to the September waiting list data published by the NTPF, 86% of patients on the outpatient waiting lists for Cavan Hospital are waiting less than 12 months for their appointment and nearly 95% are waiting less than 15 months.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the HSE and the NTPF to implement measures to reduce waiting times.  At my request, in August, the HSE developed an action plan to reduce, by year end, the number of patients currently waiting 18 months or more for an impatient-day case procedure.</p>  <p>  Also the NTPF is currently implementing an Endoscopy Initiative which aims to ensure that, by year end, no patient will be waiting 12 months or more for an endoscopy procedure. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, &euro;7m of the Winter Initiative funding is to be utilised to fund a targeted waiting list programme to provide treatment for patients waiting for orthopaedic, spinal and scoliosis procedures.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55m in 2018.  Planning of this initiative is at an advanced stage by the NTPF, my Department and the HSE.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

This is due to a range of factors including intense competition globally and from private providers for nurses due to a world wide shortage and the international standing of public nurses trained in Ireland, working conditions and lifestyle choices.  I am committed to making terms and conditions for all nurses and midwives working in the Irish public health system as attractive as possible.</p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date  include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.</p>  <p>In the past week the Government has approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  This decision means that all nurses and midwives will have incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year.  It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.</p>  <p>  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives. In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 is available to nurses who return from overseas. </p>  <p>  There has been increase of 1,163 nurses employed in the public health service (34,375 to 35,538) from August 2014 to August 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014.  The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest ever health budget, and this will allow for the filling of an additional 1,000 nursing posts. </p></reply>

Our discussions were timely, especially given the recent indication by Prime Minister May that she will trigger Article 50 no later than March next year.  During his visit, Mr Barnier also met with the T&aacute;naiste; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Minister for European Affairs, as well as senior officials. </p>  <p>  Mr. Barnier, who took office as Head of the European Commission's Brexit Taskforce on 1 October, will lead the EU's technical negotiations with the UK. </p>  <p>  This process will advance under the political guidance of EU Heads of State or Government at the European Council, once the UK Government has formally triggered Article 50.</p>  <p>  My exchange with Mr Barnier was open and constructive.  He is well-known to us in Ireland, given his various roles at national and at EU levels.  Consequently he has a nuanced appreciation of our close historical, political and economic ties with the UK. </p>  <p>  During our discussions, I took the opportunity to emphasise and explain in some detail Ireland's unique set of concerns arising from Brexit, in relation to Northern Ireland, the peace process, and citizenship issues; the Common Travel Area and border issues; and the depth of our economic and trade relationship with the UK.  We also spoke about Ireland's strong support for EU membership and our commitment to play a full part in the negotiations process.  In this context, I briefed Mr. Barnier about the various strands of work which are advancing here at political and official levels to prepare Ireland to the maximum extent possible for the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Given the critical role of Mr. Barnier and the Commission, it was also useful to hear his thoughts about the process and how negotiations might be handled in the next, critical phase.</p>  <p>  I assured Mr. Barnier that we looked forward to working closely with the Commission team in the months ahead and we agreed to stay in close contact.</p></reply>

This includes alleged discrimination in relation to the provision of Housing Assistance Payment and rent allowance as provided for in the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015.  I do not propose to change those arrangements.

Relevant provisions in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 apply in the case of for mortgages created after 1 December 2009, while broadly similar provisions in the Conveyancing Act 1881 apply to mortgages created prior to that date.  Apart from these statutory powers enshrined in the 2009 and 1881 Acts, the legal instruments which create mortgages usually contain broader contractual terms between the parties in relation to appointment of a receiver and any additional powers which he or she may exercise on appointment.</p>  <p>  When it comes to exercising the power of sale, the law imposes on the mortgagee, and any receiver appointed by the mortgagee, a duty of care to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that the mortgaged property is sold at the best price reasonably obtainable.  This obligation to act in good faith in the interests of a distressed borrower, which is now set out in section 103 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, is reflective of earlier case law.  Depending on the circumstances and the nature of the property, achieving the best price reasonable obtainable may require vacant possession of the property and this has also been recognised by the courts.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality to intervene in a manner which might adversely impact on the interests of distressed borrowers whose property is being sold by mortgagees or receivers appointed by them.  Rules applicable to the giving of notice of sale to tenants in such cases vary according to the type of tenancy, including those which fall within the scope of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p></reply>

Immigration and borders policy, including the preservation of the Common Travel Area, is of course of central importance to this process.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the objective of pursuing a balanced migration policy that supports our economy and meets our international and humanitarian obligations, whilst also taking a tough approach to tackling illegal migration. It also commits to supporting a humanitarian response to the current refugee crisis and providing a safe haven to those who come to Ireland under EU programmes. The Programme also sets out a number of actions to be taken by the Government in achieving these goals.  Significant progress has already been made across a wide number of areas in delivering on this programme including:</p><p><i>Supporting the Economy:</i>Key examples of work in this area include Ireland&rsquo;s Immigrant Investor Scheme and Start-Up Entrepreneur Programme as well as our ongoing work to support the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s International Education Strategy (2016-2020), which was launched in October by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Economic activity and tourism are also supported by measures such as the British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS), whereby a visitor to either Ireland or the UK requires only one single visa (either an Irish or UK one depending on their first country of landing) and the recent extension of the Irish Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme for a further five years to 31 October 2021 which make it easier for visitors from countries covered under the programme to come to visit Ireland.</p><p><i>Irish Refugee Protection Programme:</i><b></b>The IRPP was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the humanitarian crisis that developed in Southern Europe as a consequence of mass migration from areas of conflict in the Middle East and Africa.  The IRPP pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  This was made up of 520 under resettlement and 2,622 under the EU Relocation programme.  A further 260 has been approved by the Government under Resettlement, with the balance of the allocation to be decided.  By the end of this year the full complement of 520 will be resettled. My officials are in Lebanon now finalising the additional 260 under resettlement who will arrive next Spring and I am actively considering a further substantial pledge under resettlement.  While the relocation programme from Greece and Italy has been slower to progress due to on the ground logistical and technical challenges there, following constant engagement and visits from my officials, significant numbers of asylum seekers are now beginning to arrive in Ireland from Greece and I am hopeful that numbers will also start arriving from Italy in due course.  It is expected that up to 400 persons will arrive by year end under this programme.  The intention is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017, at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments within the timeframe envisaged by the Programme.</p><p>This will depend on the continued cooperation of the Greek and Italian authorities in the process of selecting and assessing persons for assignment to Ireland.</p><p><i>Working Group on the Protection Process:</i>The Report of the Working Group on the Protection Process was published following the Government decision of 30 June, 2015.  A significant number of the Working Group recommendations have now been implemented, partially implemented or are in progress. It should also be noted that a small number of the recommendations have been superseded by Government initiatives in the interim since the publication of the Report.  In responding to length of time issues my Department has been proactively engaged in an examination of cases of those longest in the system.  These cases are being expedited resulting in a substantial number of people who were greater than five years in the system now dealt with. This has been a significant achievement which has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process.  A key recommendation of the Working Group was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015, which provides for such a procedure, was signed by the President on 30<sup></sup>December 2015. It introduces significant reform of the multi-layered sequential protection process.  With additional resources to address the significant number of cases in the current system, the intention is to commence the single application procedure in the coming months taking into account the significant transitional arrangements needed to be put in place in advance of commencement.  When successfully implemented and resourced it is aimed that a determination of the applicant&rsquo;s status can be made in approximately 6 &ndash; 9 months.</p><p><i>Integration:</i>The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, which operates under the ambit of my Department, has a cross-Departmental mandate to develop, lead and coordinate migrant integration policy across other Government Departments, agencies and services.  The Office is currently engaged in a review of the approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation and publication of a new updated Migrant Integration Strategy.  The work undertaken by the Office thus far has included, <i>inter alia</i>, an extensive public consultation process including the involvement of key stakeholders.  The Strategy is being finalised and will be published at the end of 2016.</p><p><i>Enforcement:</i>The legislation in the enforcement area was recently amended by way of section 78 of the International Protection Act 2015, commenced on 10 March this year.  These amendments have inserted a new section 5 into the Immigration Act 1999 which deals with effecting deportation orders for persons illegally present in the State.  The increasing number of deportation orders effected since the legislative changes were introduced demonstrates the knock-on effect of the new legislation.  Targeted measures are being deployed to tackle abuse of our immigration and asylum system.  Specific Garda immigration operations run at the land border with Northern Ireland and at the Ports and other measures, such as Operation Vantage, have resulted in a reduction in the number of asylum seekers who have previous UK immigration histories.  Operation Vantage is ongoing and forms part of my Department&rsquo;s overall response to preventing so called &quot;sham marriages&quot; taking place.  Garda intelligence arising from the operation and information and data gathered from applications to INIS have led to the review of over 350 relevant applications by INIS, with a view to revoking immigration permission which may have been obtained by false pretences.  In addition, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, INIS and the General Registrars Office for Births, Marriages and Deaths continue to work closely to prevent such marriages taking place and to ensure no immigration advantage is gained as a result.  In addition, concerns regarding abuses of Free Movement are also the subject of investigation.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Lebanon.</p><p>In terms of the resettlement of programme refugees, in 13 May 2015 the European Commission published an EU Agenda for Migration.  Among the measures proposed was the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places across the EU with each Member State's allocations calculated according to a distribution key. Ireland's allocation under this mechanism was 272 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict to be resettled in Ireland over a two year period up to mid 2017.</p><p>  Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would go further and would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18 month period - up to the end of 2016. This was almost double the figure proposed by the Commission.  This cohort form part of the commitment made by Ireland under the IRPP.  As of today, 500 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland and a further seven are scheduled to arrive on 8 November.  The remainder of the quota of 520 will be taken in by the end of 2016, ahead of the schedule set out by the Commission.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.  Hence, at least 780 of the 4,000 that Ireland has agreed to accept under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme will come purely from the refugee cohort.  The possibility of an additional refugee pledge in 2017 is under active consideration.  Other mechanisms to fill the gap are also under review and will be contingent on further developments at EU level.</p><p>Under the EU relocation strand of the IRPP, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Relocation mechanism in a timely fashion.  Following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  Ireland has provided the Greek authorities with a full timetable for the acceptance, by end September 2017, of the entire cohort of asylum seekers allocated to Ireland under the relevant Council Decisions.  Ireland has to-date taken in 69 Syrians from Greece, a further 40 people are scheduled to arrive this month and another 63 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival.  Earlier this month IRPP officials interviewed a group of 71 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in November.  Further missions are scheduled for November and December and by the end of 2016 it is expected that Ireland will have accepted up to 400 people from Greece through the relocation pledge system.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments within the time frame envisaged by the Programme.</p><p>The relocation of migrants from Italy to Ireland has been hampered by technical issues which were the subject of discussion with the Italian delegation in the margins of last month's Prague Process conference on migration in Bratislava.  Officials are now working through these issues with colleagues in Brussels and I hope that the matter can be resolved in the near future which will allow the numbers being taken in under the IRPP to increase further.</p></reply>

The two centres are the Hazel Hotel in Monasterevin and the Clonea Strand Hotel in Dungarvan.</p><p>The groups of refugees are brought to Ireland under the UNHCR Resettlement Programme.  The orientation period gives them time to rest and adjust to their new environment and to learn about Irish life and culture. It is also a time of recovery.  While in the centre, resettled refugees receive information on their statutory entitlements in accordance with section 24 and section 3 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and on their responsibilities.</p><p>  Also during this period in the EROC, an orientation and language training programme is provided for adults, from 18 years upwards, for a period of 6-8 weeks to prepare them for independent living in communities around Ireland.  The programme refugees are linked to local service providers and have the time to visit their GP to have urgent health matters addressed.</p><p>  Children under the age of 18 participate in an induction programme to prepare them for entry into mainstream education.  They may be placed in early years educational programmes if appropriate and available, or childcare is provided to facilitate the adults' participation in the orientation and language programme.</p><p>Additional information on the UNHCR Resettlement Programme can be found at:<i> and </i>.</p></reply>

Phase three has recently commenced, and as with Phase two, regional consultation meetings are being held.  Two of the three scheduled meetings have now taken place, with the third taking place next week.  Following this third phase, a draft Strategy will be prepared with the assistance of the National Disability Strategy Steering Group for consideration by Government.  It is envisaged that the new Strategy will be in place by end 2016.  Issues in relation to the Deaf Community have featured strongly in the consultation process to date and I intend that the new Disability Inclusion Strategy will respond credibly to the issues raised, including making a real difference in relation to facilitating the use of Irish Sign Language (ISL).  For instance one of the actions proposes legislation that will ensure that all public bodies provide ISL users with free ISL interpretation when availing of their statutory services.  This would apply to all areas, including the Midlands.  In relation to operational issue re service availability, I should mention that funding is provided by Department of Social Protection, via the Citizens Information Board, to support ISL services nationally.</p></reply>

This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80% in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of an e-vetting system.</p>  <p>  In April this year I commenced the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and in tandem with that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the e-vetting system.  E-vetting facilitates the on-line processing of applications and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications. I am informed that at present 85&amp;amp; of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-vetting system.  There is a small number of organisations, including some in the education sector, who do not yet operate the e-vetting system.  The Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so and will assist organisations to register for e-Vetting without delay.</p>  <p>  There were reports recently of delays with regard to vetting applications in respect of some Special Needs Assistants posts.  In these cases the vetting applications were submitted in the old paper format.  For vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four to five weeks from the receipt of the application by the National Vetting Bureau.  This has been the average time frame for paper applications for the past couple of years and this represents a minimum time frame given the administrative input required.  The Garda Authorities will work through all of the applications received as quickly as may be but this must be consistent with ensuring that the proper checks are carried out.</p>  <p>  Processing times for some applications can be longer than others when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary or where errors have been made in the application.  It is important to note that delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.</p></reply>

While acknowledging its role as part of wider crime prevention strategies, the Garda evaluation also notes that community based CCTV systems have been of significant assistance in both the prevention and detection of criminal activity throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am happy to inform the Deputy that I have secured &euro;1 million in budget 2017 for a new round of community CCTV schemes in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to provide investment in CCTV systems.

These Regulations provide that the number of persons to be admitted as trainees by reference to a particular competition is determined by the Commissioner with the consent of the Minister.</p>  <p>  Since the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Police Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 on the 15 December 2015, 450 trainee Garda have been recruited, with a further 200 expected to enter the Garda College next month.  This will bring to 1,200 the number of total number of trainee Garda recruited since the reopening of the College in September 2014.  Since 15 December 2015, 238 trainee Garda have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide; another 150 are due to attest later this year bringing the total number of new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 684 since the reopening of the College.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I announced last week that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on last September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched November 2015) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p></reply>

Part 10 of the Act is divided into five Chapters of which Chapter 3, consisting of sections 149 to 153, deals with the duties of legal practitioners in relation to legal costs. The remaining Chapters of this Part deal with other aspects of the new legal costs regime including the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators that will take over the work currently carried out by the Office of the Taxing-Master along with the way in which the new legal costs adjudication process will operate. All legal practitioners will be obliged, under the transparency provisions of Chapter 3, to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. The details of these transparency provisions remain as set out in my Written Reply of 16 September to which the Deputy has referred.  </p><p>The provisions of Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act provide, in Chapter 2, or the changeover from the existing Office of the Taxing-Master to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators. The new and enhanced legal costs adjudication process is found in Chapter 4 of Part 10 as set out in my previous Reply. </p><p>It remains the case that there is no impediment to the various provisions of Part 10 taking effect other than that of ensuring, through detailed planning and sequencing, that the relevant legal and administrative arrangements are properly in place. This includes within the Courts system where the adjudications of legal costs under the new structure will be conducted in succession to the existing taxation of costs regime.  The Deputy will appreciate that a significant transformation of the existing taxation of costs system is provided for in Part 10 of the Act and that this cannot be done arbitrarily and must be managed carefully - including in terms of having the relevant personnel and expertise in place and given the fundamental legal procedures involved. </p><p>As I have previously conveyed, the five Chapters of Part 10 of the 2015 Act are very much interlinked and their successful commencement will be key to the phased roll-out of the Legal Services Regulation Act which is already underway. As with other Parts of the Act which will be commenced on a phased basis over the coming period, I am, along with officials at my Department and the Courts Service, giving detailed consideration to the commencement of Part 10. This includes the possible prioritisation for commencement of sections 149 to 161 contained in Chapter 3 as may be practicable from both a structural reform and a legal perspective.</p><p>On 19 July 2016 I commenced those provisions of Parts 1 and 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 necessary to support the appointment and start-up of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; S.I. No. 383 of 2016 refers.  On 29 September, as provided under section 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, I appointed, by order, 1 October 2016<b>,</b>as establishment day of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  The resolutions of both Houses approving those nominated by the prescribed nominating bodies for membership of the new Regulatory Authority were completed on 6th October in accordance with the relevant procedures and criteria in Part 2 of the 2015 Act. Dr. Don Thornhill has been appointed Chairperson of the new Authority which will hold its inaugural meeting later this month. Following on from these initial steps, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function and the completion of all aspects of the transition to the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.</p></reply>

The judgment refers to a case in which the Greek authorities failed to finally determine an asylum application which had been lodged initially by the applicant in January 2002.</p>  <p>  With regard to the asylum processing system in place in this jurisdiction, the Deputy will be aware that the International Protection Act was signed into law by the President late last year.  The Act provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for protection applications. Under the single procedure, an applicant will make only one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process. The single procedure will replace the current multi-layered and sequential protection application system, and this reform is designed to significantly simplify and streamline existing arrangements and allow us to grant international protection in a significantly shorter timeframe to those who are entitled to it while identifying, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin. All preparations are currently being made by my Department for the commencement of the Act. </p>  <p>  Under the new legislation, a dedicated unit of my Department, to be known as the 'International Protection Office' will be the determining authority at first instance for applications for international protection, replacing the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC). The case workers making decisions under the new structure are specialists in the processing of protection cases and trained to UNCHR standards.</p>  <p>  The existing Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) will be replaced by a newly constituted and independent appeals body to be known as the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. The newly configured and resourced Tribunal is designed to lead to the more efficient conduct of its business and greater consistency in its appeals decisions.</p>  <p>  The transitional provisions in the Act set out how protection applications which are pending in the existing system on the commencement date will be dealt with. In order to achieve a smooth transition from the existing system to the single applications procedure, additional resources are being deployed to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), ORAC and RAT to assist with the implementation of the Act, including the tackling of existing caseloads both prior and subsequent to the commencement of the Act.</p></reply>

The global portfolio has been restructured and is being sold over time to fund Irish investment commitments as they arise, in keeping with ISIF's mandate to invest, on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment, in Ireland.</p><p>ISIF's equity holdings in the Energy sector are valued at &euro;11 million (0.14% of ISIF's assets under management).  ISIF is also invested in circa. &euro;97 million of short term fixed income investments in energy corporations representing just over 1% of the ISIF's assets.</p><p>Such investments should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables.  ISIF's investment strategy is aligned with government policy and the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy. The strategy states that ISIF's &euro;800m energy allocation will include a significant element of renewables investment. To date such investment commitments include:</p><p>- &euro;44 million for the &euro;500 million Dublin Waste to Energy project.</p><p>- &euro;35 million commitment to NTR's onshore wind fund. </p><p>- Investment in Bluebay SME credit fund which has made loans to Gaelectric and Mainstream, Irish headquartered renewable energy developers.</p><p>- Being a cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) which holds a number of Irish onshore wind assets, forestry, and a designer/manufacturer of high power density high efficiency power supplies. </p><p>As part of its on-going commitment to operate to high international standards ISIF has recently published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy which is available online at: .</p><p>The Policy emphasises climate change as part of the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into its investment decision making. </p><p>Many major funds internationally have made significant divestments from fossil fuels such as coal, while other such funds have adopted an approach of engagement with energy companies to establish their strategy and positioning for the transition to a low carbon economy.  ISIF continually reviews its carbon exposure and the investment case for companies that may not be aligned with the long term transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, which established ISIF on a statutory basis provides that ISIF shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers, as appropriate.  This review will be completed in Q4 2016 and the issues of decarbonisation and Ireland's long term transition towards a low carbon economy are being considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

The aim of the Incentive is to support tax compliant building contractors by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy.  The Incentive was introduced in October 2013.  It provides for tax relief for homeowners or landlords by way of an income tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure.  Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 including VAT at 13.5% rate.  The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is &euro;30,000 including VAT at 13.5%.  This equates to a maximum tax credit of &euro;4,050.  The tax credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is paid for.</p>  <p>  The Incentive was due to end on 31 December 2016.  However, I announced in last week's Budget that I am extending the Incentive for a further 2 years to end on 31 December 2018.  This will allow additional time for homeowners and landlords to carry out renovation works and will also provide continued stimulus to the construction sector.</p>  <p>  The Living City Initiative is a scheme of property tax incentives designed to regenerate both historic buildings and other buildings in specified cities.  The scheme applies to certain special regeneration areas (SRAs) in the centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny.  The relief applies to both residential and commercial refurbishment and conversion work that is carried out during the qualifying period.  There are 2 types of tax relief available under the Living City Initiative - an owner-occupier residential element, and a retail/commercial element.  The Deputy may be aware that in this year's Budget there were a number of changes to the initiative to encourage an increase in the take-up of the scheme.  The changes included:</p>  <p>  - Removing the restriction on the maximum floor size of the qualifying property</p>  <p>  - Removing the requirement, for the residential element of the initiative, that the property must have been previously used as a dwelling</p>  <p>  - Changing the minimum amount of expenditure needed to qualify from 10% of the value of the property to match the minimum spend under the Home Renovation Incentive, which is &euro;5,000</p>  <p>  - Extending the availability of the scheme such that landlords can avail of it in respect of the renovation of rental accommodation in the special regeneration areas.</p>  <p>  There is another (limited) tax relief available for expenditure incurred on the maintenance of significant buildings and gardens, which is provided for in Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  To qualify for this relief the relevant building must be determined by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to be of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public.</p></reply>

While the public finances are improving, it is still the case that the yield from the various taxes, including CGT, needs to be protected.</p>  <p>  It is also likely to be the case that where agricultural land is acquired under a compulsory purchase order, the acquiring authorities usually pay a premium over the agricultural value.  The premium may well cover the tax due on the disposal and the farmer may well have received the agricultural value of the land in his or her net proceeds after the disposal.  This means that farmers are likely to be able to purchase agricultural  land of equivalent value to the land acquired under the compulsory purchase order.</p>  <p>  An Agri-Taxation review was published in October 2014 in the context of Bud get 2015.  It's objective was to maximise the benefits for the farming sector and the wider economy of the existing level of State support through the tax system.  The Review set out a strategy for agri-taxation policy for the future and concluded that the three main policy objectives would be:</p>  <p>  1. Increase the mobility and productive use of land</p>  <p>  2. Assist succession</p>  <p>  3. complement wider agricultural policies and schemes, such as supporting environmental sustainability</p>  <p>  The Review made policy recommendations, taking into consideration the cost of the existing Agri-taxation measures that were already in existence and the need to protect the position of the public finances.  Many of the Review's recommendations have been included in Budget 2015 and subsequent Budgets.  However, the Review did not recommend change to the tax treatment of land disposed under a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO).</p>  <p>  I did, however, announce in my Budget 2016 speech the introduction of a revised CGT entrepreneur relief from 1 January 2016 under which a lower 20% rate of CGT will apply to chargeable gains arising on the disposal of an individual's qualifying assets (up to a lifetime limit of &euro;1 million).  Last week, in my Budget 2017 speech, I announced that the applicable CGT rate will be further lowered to 10%, effective from 1 January 2017.  The revised CGT entrepreneur relief applies to disposals of qualifying business assets by farmers, among others.</p>  <p>  I am aware of concerns that have been expressed regarding the lack of roll-over relief on the part of and on behalf of landowners who have been subject to CPO.  However, for the reasons outlined, I have no plans to introduce CGT roll-over relief in respect of gains on land disposed of under a CPO.</p></reply>

Forecasts of fiscal variables including available fiscal space are routinely updated in these publications.</p>  <p>  I have outlined previously that the fiscal space in 2017 was largely fixed but was subject to certain moving parts.  In aggregate, revisions caused an increase in fiscal space of some &euro;200m or approximately &frac14; of a percent of the overall general government expenditure of &euro;76.6 billion forecast for 2017.</p>  <p>  The fiscal space available for Budget 2017 is reconciled with the estimate published in the SES in Box One of Chapter 3 in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook in the Budget book 2017, the details of which I will revisit here.</p>  <p>  For 2017, the reference rates and convergence margins were set by the European Commission in its Spring forecast published in May.  However, the GDP deflator used is an average of the Commissions Spring and Autumn deflators.  As the Commission's Autumn forecasts will not be published until after Budget 2017, this necessitates using the forecast for the deflator from the Department of Finance's Autumn forecasts published on Budget day.</p>  <p>  My Department presented an estimate of this deflator to IFAC and the Budgetary Oversight Committee on October 4th as part of the macroeconomic forecast that was endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Council on October 6th.  The Budget deflator reflecting the impact of the 2017 budgetary package reduced fiscal space by &euro;75m.  The purpose of the Budgetary Oversight Committee appearance by my officials was to discuss technical aspects of the macro economic forecasts and not to discuss the fiscal situation or policy implications arising.</p>  <p>  Revisions to the 2015 general government expenditure estimates were provided on a confidential basis to my Department following the first transmission of this data to Eurostat by the CSO on the 29th September.  This data was subsequently published by the CSO in the Government Finance Statistics on October 10th.  Revisions to the 2015 outturn have resulted in an update to the Department's estimate of the 2016 and 2017 expenditure base.  Notably, the estimates of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) were revised for the period 2012 to 2015.  To avoid penalising spikes in government investment in GFCF, the European Commission allows this investment to be averaged over a four year period with the result that any changes to the levels of this investment will impact on available fiscal space.</p>  <p>  As well as data from the CSO, revenue and expenditure surveys of the Local Authorities and other general government bodies are returned as part of the budgetary process, these also included updated forecasts of GFCF expenditure in 2016 and 2017 updating further the Department's estimates of the expenditure bases used.  The combined effect of these changes to the estimates of GFCF expenditure in 2016 and 2017 has increased available fiscal space in 2017 by approximately &euro;120m.</p>  <p>  In my answer to the Deputy's other question today, I describe in detail the changes in fiscal space referred to in Budget Box 1 as Revised Carryover.  As indicated, this has two elements the first being the impact of the revisions to the Revenue Commissioners methodology regarding the calculation of first year and full year costs of potential Budget tax packages.  These changes took effect from June 2016 and the Revenue Commissioners pre-budget 2017 Ready Reckoner went live on 14th July.</p>  <p>  The second element was the impact on the cost of indexation in 2017 on the revised tax base which was confirmed following the macroeconomic forecast endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Council on October 6th.  These changes combined increased fiscal space by &euro;155m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-18a.481.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101800078#WRJ02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 196 together.</p><p>At the time of the Summer Economic Statement (SES) it was estimated that there would be c. &euro;1.0 billion in fiscal space for 2017.  Amongst other things, this consisted of c. &euro;340 million of carryover from Budget 2016 measures, of which income tax and USC accounted for approximately &euro;292 million.  In addition, it was also estimated that the non-indexation of the income tax system in 2016 would yield &euro;300 million in 2016, with a positive carryover of approximately &euro;100 million into 2017.</p><p>However, since the SES, the Revenue Commissioners have updated their method of estimating the first and full year costs of tax measures with effect from July 2016.  This followed an analysis of the first year/full year apportionment of costs which was undertaken to ensure the estimated apportionment is as accurate as possible.  Accordingly, from earlier this year, a larger proportion of the costs/yields of such measures are attributed to the first year, which results in a lower carryover cost in the second year.  It should be noted that this does not change the full-year cost of a measure, only the allocation of that cost between first year and carryover costs.  Therefore, as a result of Revenue's revised methodology, it is anticipated that more of the cost of the income tax and USC package from Budget 2016 is being incurred in 2016 than was previously estimated.  In addition, the carryover cost from the non-indexation of the income tax system in 2016 has also been reduced.</p><p><b>Table 1 at time of SES illustrates the impact of the carryover effect of Budget 2016 measures and non-indexation of income tax system in 2016: </b><table><tr><th>Description </th><th>2016 cost/yield </th><th>Full year cost/yield  </th><th>2017 carryover </th></tr><tr><td>Budget 2016 Income tax and USC measures </td><td>-&euro;595 million</td><td>-&euro;887 million</td><td>-&euro;292 million</td></tr><tr><td>2016 Non-indexation of income tax system </td><td>+&euro;300 million</td><td>+&euro;400 million </td><td>+&euro;100 million </td></tr><tr><td>Total Net effect </td><td>-&euro;295 million</td><td>-&euro;487 million</td><td>-&euro;192 million <br /><br /></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2 Budget 2017 illustrates the impact of Revenue's revised methodology on the carryover effect of Budget 2016 measures and non-indexation of income tax system in 2016: </b><table><tr><th>Description </th><th>2016 cost/yield  applying revised Methodology </th><th>Full cost/yield</th><th>revised 2017 carryover </th></tr><tr><td>Budget 2016 Income tax and USC measures </td><td>-&euro;695 million</td><td>-&euro;887 million </td><td>-&euro;192 million </td></tr><tr><td>2016 Non-indexation of income tax system </td><td>+&euro;330 million </td><td>+&euro;400 million </td><td>+&euro;70 million </td></tr><tr><td>Total Net effect </td><td>-&euro;365 million</td><td>-&euro;487 million </td><td>-&euro;122 million  </td></tr><tr><td>Impact on Fiscal Space</td><td>-&euro;70 million</td><td>-</td><td>+ &euro; 70 million</td></tr></table></p><p>Therefore, the tables above account for c. &euro;70 million of the &euro;155 adjustment to the carryover effect into 2017.  The balance of &euro;85 million is accounted for as follows. </p><p>At the time of SES, it was estimated that the non-indexation of income tax system in 2017 would yield &euro;300 million in 2017 and &euro;400 million a full year.  However, applying Revenues revised methodology and taking account of the updated 2017 tax base and macroeconomic drivers, it now estimated that the non-indexation of the income tax system in 2017 would yield c. &euro;385 million and &euro;450 million in a full year, which accounts for the balance of &euro;85 million in 2017.</p><p>The impact of these changes on the expenditure benchmark rule in 2016 was to increase the fiscal space used in the year by &euro;70m as detailed in tables above.  However as the Deputy will be aware, there is a significant buffer built into the calculation of Ireland's compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2016, due to the treatment of the conversion of the AIB preference shares to ordinary shares as a capital transfer (expenditure) rather than a reinvestment of capital.  This &euro;70 million does not compromise compliance with the expenditure benchmark rule in 2016.</p><p>The impact of this &euro;155 million on compliance with the expenditure benchmark for 2017 (as detailed in Box 1 page C.22 in the Budget 2017 book) gives an extra &euro;155m of fiscal space, thereby explaining a significant portion of the &euro;200 million change in fiscal space.</p><p>As regards compliance with the structural deficit target, the impact of the &euro;155 million on the pace of improvement in the structural balance 2016 is marginal, at 0.02p percentage points of GDP.  As such, it should have no material impact upon reaching the Medium Term Objective, that is, a structural deficit of -0.5 of GDP by 2018.</p></reply>

This was based on fiscal space of &euro;1 billion, but the effect of capital smoothing meant that actual capital spend of &euro;250m only absorbed &euro;60 million in terms of available fiscal space.  Budget 2017 introduced a package of &euro;1.3 billion which uses fiscal space of &euro;1.2 billion.</p>  <p>  Based on the Commission's matrix specifying the required annual fiscal adjustment towards Medium Term Budgetary Objective (MTO), the required adjustment in our structural budget balance in 2017 was fixed at 0.6 percentage points.  This requirement was set reflecting both our public debt sustainability and the cyclical position of Ireland's economy.

To be clear, the &euro;1 billion in fiscal space outlined in the context of the Summer Economic Statement (SES) in June 2016 was consistent with full compliance with the expenditure benchmark in 2017.  Since then, a number of changes including a revision in the composition of expenditure data from the CSO and a revision in the carryover cost of implementing the 2016 tax package, have meant the permitted fiscal space in 2017 is now some &euro;200m higher than previously estimated.  An increase of 0.3 per cent relative to a permitted expenditure ceiling of &euro;69.5 billion should however be seen as modest.</p>  <p>  Whilst the increase in permitted fiscal space relative to the SES is measured at &euro;200m, the resulting 2017 fiscal package of &euro;1.3 billion is just &euro;100m higher than communicated in the context of SES.  This difference arises due to the 2016 capital package absorbing c. &euro;50m and a reallocation of capital into current spending in 2017 absorbing a further c. &euro;50m.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this increase in permitted space, the excess over the permitted spending ceiling alluded to by the Fiscal Council for 2017 and set out in Budget Table A7 relates solely to the &euro;200m increase in EU budget contribution arising due to the July revisions to Ireland's national accounts data for 2015.  Net of this higher contribution, Budget projections confirm that the use of this &euro;1.3 billion package in 2017 (i.e. spending the announced &euro;900m in expenditure measures and factoring in the net cost of funding the &euro;300m taxation package), is compliant with the provisions of the expenditure benchmark in 2017.</p>  <p>  Even leaving this aside, my Department has projected a 0.8 percentage point improvement in the structural balance in 2017, again in compliance with our obligations.</p></reply>

In the absence of a fully designed scheme of refundable tax credits that addresses all of the relevant issues outlined, an estimated cost of refunding of credits referred to by the Deputy is not currently available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that this matter was looked at in some detail by the Working Group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare system.  The Group was chaired by the Department of Finance and included representatives from ICTU, IBEC, the various farming organisations, the Community and Voluntary Pillar, relevant Government Departments and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The Working Group found that there were significant disadvantages with such a system.  These included the potential negative impacts on the incentive to work, labour supply, labour force participation and overall productivity and output.  The Commission on Taxation in its 2009 report also did not recommend the introduction of refundable tax credits.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 I have continued the process of reducing the income tax burden for low and middle income earners commenced in Budgets 2015 and 2016.  These changes are designed to ensure that work pays and to help individuals to transition from unemployment back into jobs and indeed to remove potential blockages that may be deterring part-time workers from taking on additional hours of employment.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-10-18a.505.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016101800078#WRJ04600"><p>The State encourages individuals to save for their retirement by providing generous tax incentives for them to invest some of their earned income in Revenue approved pension saving arrangements.  The incentives include exemptions from income tax on pension contributions up to certain limits and exemption from various taxes in respect of pension fund growth.  Benefits drawn down at retirement are, in turn, subject to tax at the individual's marginal tax rate, with the exception of the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.</p>  <p>  The details supplied with the question would suggest that the issue being raised relates to small self-administered pension schemes (SSASs) and the capacity of such schemes to invest in investment properties associated with the scheme member.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that SSASs are a particular type of occupational pension scheme in respect of which special requirements apply in relation to their approval, operation and supervision.  The reason for these requirements is to ensure that such schemes are established for the bona fide purpose of providing retirement benefits.  The concern in this regard reflects the fact that, as such schemes are generally one member schemes, that member typically being a proprietary director, there is potential for a conflict of interest to arise.  This is because the individual is not only the sole member of the scheme but is also normally the owner of the company sponsoring the scheme and a trustee of the scheme.</p>  <p>  While property investment is permitted by such funds, purchases and disposals must in all cases be at arm's length from the scheme, the member, the sponsoring company, its directors and any associated companies.</p>  <p>  The proposal being put forward in the question would effectively require these property related restrictions to be relaxed, so that a member of a small self-administered pension scheme could sell an investment property to his or her scheme or to use part of the scheme assets to invest in property associated with the member.</p>  <p>  While I can appreciate the reasoning behind this proposal, I think it is important not to lose sight of the purpose of supplementary pension saving and the generous tax incentives, already mentioned, that the State continues to provide to encourage it.  The sole purpose of pension savings is to provide relevant benefits to the scheme member at the point of retirement or, indeed, earlier in the event of retirement on ill-health grounds.  The investment opportunities envisaged under the proposal might not represent a prudent investment in many cases and could put the availability of those benefits when needed at undue risk.  In addition, investment in a single asset class, as recent history would demonstrate, is rarely if ever a prudent course of action.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the proposal is well intentioned, it would seem to me to be difficult, if the rules governing investment by SSASs were relaxed in the manner suggested, to resist calls for a broader relaxation to allow, for example, assets such as family or holiday homes to be acquired by a pension scheme or to permit investment in the employing company to stave off short term cash flow difficulties.  In other words, it could be a first step towards a dismantling of the very rules that are in place to protect an individual's pension savings.</p>  <p>  For all these reasons I would not be in favour of this proposal.</p></reply>

This will allow future Governments to not only apply the rainy day fund but, in the event of future shocks, the capacity to borrow to mitigate the impact of such shocks on the lives of our people.  This target goes beyond the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, and reflects the fact that as a small and very open economy, a shock in any part of the world affects us.  The rationale for this target is: </p>  <p>  1. That GDP measures can be quite volatile in Ireland as indicated by the 26% growth rate for 2015 and</p>  <p>  2. The need to build up a safety buffer to ensure continuing market access. </p>  <p>  The growth outlook underlying this target is as set out up to 2021 in the Fiscal and Economic Outlook published with the Budget last week, and after that an assumed average nominal GDP growth rate of 4.5% out to 2026, made up of real growth of 2.5% and a price increase of 2%.  The debt projections make the technical assumption that the 2021 primary balance of 2.6% of GDP is maintained thereafter, with the average implicit interest rate held constant at it 2021 value.  This projected timing does not factor in proceeds from the sale of banking assets, which will be used to lower debt.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve this target, it is critical that we reach our Medium Term Budgetary Objective or MTO defined as a balanced budget in structural terms - in 2018 - and maintain it thereafter and that is what the Government intends to do.</p></reply>

This measure will enable farmers to improve the management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of their short-term borrowings so they can continue to trade during the current period of commodity price volatility.</p>  <p>  The government is committed to supporting the wider financing needs of SMEs, in all sectors of the economy, and ensuring that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established to increase the availability of credit to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms.  In this regard, it is encouraging to note that to the end of June 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million to 8,619 SMEs.  On average, the SBCI provides a discount of circa 1.5% on the market interest rate to SMEs.</p>  <p>  The SBCI continues to have significant lending capacity; it has funding agreements in place with the European Investment Bank, KfW and the NTMA and has a current funding capacity of over &euro;1 billion to enable it to make low cost loans available to SMEs across all qualifying sectors.</p>  <p>  The most recent Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey sought the reasons why businesses did not seek credit and the results showed that 84% of respondents who had not applied for credit stated that they did not seek credit because they did not need it.  Only a very small minority of respondents, 1%, stated that they did not seek credit because it was too expensive.</p>  <p>  The deputy should note that this particular agriculture measure is only possible due to emergency EU funding and it relates to issues that are specific to the agri-sector at present.  Given the Government measures already in place to support the wider provision of low cost financing to SMEs and the specific EU assistance available for this agriculture support, there are no plans currently to extend a similar loan scheme to SMEs generally.</p></reply>

While hedging can provide some measure of relief and provide SMEs with time to adapt to this change, it is not possible to fully mitigate the long-term impact of currency devaluation through hedging.</p>  <p>  State backed, low cost credit can assist SMEs to restructure their cost bases and re-price their products and services so they can continue trading with the UK in the weaker Sterling environment.  In this context, it is encouraging to note that SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of June 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;347 million to 8,619 SMEs.</p>  <p>  It would not be economically or fiscally sustainable for the State to subsidise an artificially set exchange rate.  Indeed, EU State Aid Regulations prohibit countries from directly subsidising exchange rates and hedging products.  However, it is important to note that there are multiple financial providers active in the Irish market that can provide a comprehensive and competitive range of hedging and foreign exchange products to SMEs who require them.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor fluctuations in the exchange rate and ensure that the wide range of State supports currently available are tailored to ensure that they provide effective support to SMEs affected by challenges arising from the UK referendum on membership of the European Union.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.   </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.   </p>  <p>  The recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO in effect reverses the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers.  The estimated value of these increases over a teacher's career is &euro;135,000.  This new arrangement will apply to members of the teacher unions which have signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement i.e. TUI and INTO.   </p>  <p>  When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).  For an individual TUI/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).   </p>  <p>  In addition to this, it must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.   </p>  <p>  The agreement on new entrant pay shows what is possible through dialogue and negotiation within the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future.</p></reply>

A Frequently Asked Questions document was also published by my Department to assist schools with queries in respect of the circular.  My Department had previously (in April 2015) published a circular which outlined the advance preparations and actions to be taken by all school authorities and registered teachers so as to facilitate, as far as possible, a smooth transition to the statutory vetting requirements once they became operational.</p>  <p>  In relation to the information requested by the Deputy in respect of unfilled vacancies in schools in the Dublin mid-west area, the position is that the filling of vacancies for teaching and non-teaching positions is carried out at individual school level.  Accordingly, information in relation to the number of unfilled vacancies in particular schools and the reasons for same at any given time is not available within my Department.</p></reply>

Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism.  It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p>  <p>  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of Special Educational Needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting, but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and 6:1.5 at post primary level, and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children. </p>  <p>  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are currently 1,153 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level of which 889 are for children with Autism.</p>  <p>  There are 4 special schools and 66 special classes attached to mainstream schools in County Kildare for 2016/17 school year (up from 64 in 15/16): 59 classes are for students with ASD, including 6 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age, 41 primary school classes and 12 at post primary level in mainstream schools.  2 of these classes are new classes due to open in September 2016, 1 at primary level and 1 at post primary level. </p>  <p>  In addition there will be 1 class for students with mild General Learning Disability, 4 classes for students with a moderate General Learning Disability and 2 classes for students with a severe/profound General Learning </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  In this regard the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in the area referred to by the Deputy in opening special classes to where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recently launched guidelines for Boards of Management and Principals of Primary and Post Primary schools which provide information on setting up and organising special classes.  These guidelines are available to download from www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, including those in County Kildare, are available on www.ncse.ie in county order, and with new classes identified.</p>  <p>  As details relating specifically to North Kildare are not readily available in my Department, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which was introduced in January 2010 and provides for early learning in a formal setting to children in the year before they commence primary school. </p><p>Children with disabilities will now have better access to pre-school services under a new Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) programme of supports, which was announced, on 15th June 2016, by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school. </p><p>The supports include:</p><p>- A new Inclusion Charter for the Early Years sector, alongside updated and strengthened Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education. </p><p>- In relation to the qualifications of early years practitioners, a new higher education programme for early years practitioners (LINC) which will commence from September 2016. </p><p>- A new national specialist service which is based in the Better Start National Early Years Quality Development Service will provide expert advice, mentoring and support to pre-school providers from a team of 50 specialists in early years care and education for children with disabilities.</p><p>- A new national scheme will provide specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations which are necessary to support a child's participation in the ECCE programme. </p><p>- A new national scheme will also provide additional capitation to pre-school providers where this is critical to fund extra support in the classroom and enable a child's participation in pre-school.  It is estimated that only 1 to 1.5% of children in pre-school will require, and therefore be eligible for, this scheme of additional capitation. </p><p>Details of the supports which will be available under AIM can be found at www.preschoolaccess.ie which contains comprehensive information on the access and inclusion model and on how to apply for the new schemes and supports. </p><p>Questions relating to provision of such services in pre-school settings should be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with Special Educational Needs, including Autism. </p><p>It is also the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.</p><p>Children who are diagnosed with Autism may be enrolled in an Early Intervention class attached to a mainstream school from the age of three.  Early Intervention classes are supported with a pupil&ndash;teacher ratio of 6:1 at primary level and also have Special Needs Assistant support normally amounting to 2 SNAs for a class of 6 children.  </p><p>Currently there are 6 Early Intervention Classes for children who are not yet school going age in County Kildare. </p><p>The NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in the area referred to by the Deputy where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p></reply>

The review is looking at all aspects of DEIS, including the range and impact of different elements of the School Support Programme, particularly the scope for increased integration of services provided by other Departments and Agencies, in order to improve effectiveness.  </p><p>Among the measures to be included in the plan are a series of pilot schemes aimed at introducing measures which have been shown to work well in improving results for disadvantaged children and students.  The plan is expected to include targeted measures in the areas of:</p><p>- Supporting school leadership.</p><p>- Developing Networks and clusters for DEIS teachers and schools.</p><p>- Supporting new teaching methodologies.  There is evidence that, for example, changing the way literacy is taught to children who struggle can achieve major improvements in results </p><p>- Exploring ways in which the work of schools can be better integrated with other state supports within the community</p><p>The results of pilot programmes will be carefully monitored before any decisions around mainstreaming are considered.</p><p>Also under consideration is the development of a new assessment framework using centrally held CSO and DES data for the identification of schools for inclusion in a new programme to tackle educational disadvantage.  The number of schools to be included in the programme will be determined by this proposed new identification process which will assess all schools in the country, including those not currently participating in DEIS. It will not be necessary for schools to make an application.</p><p>Implementation of actions arising from the Plan for Educational Inclusion will begin in the 2017/18 school year, and will be a continuing theme in our wider Annual Action Plan for Education. </p></reply>

Much is being done already in this area by my Department both in terms of the curriculum delivery and in resourcing.  My Department issued guidance to post primary schools in September 2015 on promoting healthy lifestyles, which includes healthy eating policies. Similar guidance was provided to primary schools in February 2016.</p><p>The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  With such skills and knowledge, it is hoped that our young people will make appropriate choices so that this informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people.</p><p>  The SPHE syllabus at both primary and post-primary levels contains modules which educate students on the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being.</p><p>Schools and the wider education sector have a vital role to play in contributing to the Government's 'Healthy Ireland' agenda set out in the Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025.  Healthy Ireland was published by the Department of Health in 2013, and is one of the most ambitious programmes we have ever seen focused on improving the health of the nation.</p><p>Teachers are supported through quality continuous professional development provided by my Department in order that they can equip students with the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make healthier life choices.  Schools' efforts should be complemented by students' families and their community.  My Department is not in a position to support a national roll out of the initiative referred to by the Deputy.

However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  It is important to note that the total allocation to this Department for additional policy measures, after demographics and Industrial Relations commitments, was &euro;130 million and of which all our commitments in higher and further education and primary and secondary schools had to be funded.</p>  <p>  I also intend to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents.  It is important that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard requiring schools to have a parent charter will ensure that schools will interact better with parent associations and with individual parents.</p>  <p>  I will shortly seek Government approval for the Heads of a Bill to provide for replacing Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 and the drafting of principles which will form the framework of a Parents' and Learners' Charter in every school. </p>  <p>  I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

The annual family maximum for primary children is &euro;220 while the overall family maximum is &euro;650 per annum.</p><p>These charges, which may be paid in two instalments in July and December, are a contribution towards the overall cost and do not reflect the true cost of providing school transport services.  Research carried out in the context of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme showed that the annual unit cost per pupil for the provision of school transport was some &euro;1,000, &euro;950 and &euro;7,000 for primary, post primary and </p><p>children with special educational needs (excluding escorts) respectively.</p><p>Children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid medical cards (GMS Scheme) are exempt from paying the annual charge; children who are eligible for school transport under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs are also exempt from paying the annual charge.</p><p>Given that the annual cost of school transport provision is some &euro;175m it is not proposed to change the current charges. </p></reply>

The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.  In addition to the phased transfer of Catholic schools to new patrons already under way, this requires considering new ideas and new approaches to substantially accelerate the changes in school provision in order to achieve greater diversity.  By developing new approaches I am convinced that we can significantly increase the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools.  In this regard, after taking office and in the context of developing my Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, I held meetings with a broad range of stakeholders, including patron and management bodies, as did my officials, to discuss how best this can be achieved.</p>  <p>  In this context, I met with a number of representatives of the Catholic Church, including representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference, on 22 July last to discuss primary school reconfiguration and to outline that for the areas where there is currently no diversity of provision, I am working on advancing options to provide a great choice of patronage for parents in these areas.  The Church representatives stated their desire to work with my Department to provide a greater choice for parents.  The meeting was a useful one and I am continuing to progress options for reconfiguration as a priority.  I aim to be in a position to announce the new approaches within the timeframe indicated in the Action Plan for Education.</p></reply>

These children are exempt from paying the annual charge if they hold valid Medical Cards (GMS Scheme).</p><p>The Action Plan for Education outlines hundreds of actions to be implemented over the 3 year period 2016 to 2019.  Some of the actions as part of the plan are to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by:</p><p>-  Restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit</p><p>-  Increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce or eliminate school book costs for parents</p><p>-  Issuing a new circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy and other costs and the need to put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs</p><p>Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. </p><p>It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to this element of the Action Plan due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  It is important to note that the total allocation to this Department for additional policy measures, after demographics and Industrial Relations commitments, was &euro;130 million and of which all our commitments in higher and further education and primary and secondary schools had to be funded.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s position in relation to voluntary contributions is that they are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay.  I have no plans to alter this position so long as schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned.</p><p>Separately, the Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6<sup>th</sup>July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.</p><p>I also intend to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents.  It is important that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard requiring schools to have a parent charter will ensure that schools will interact better with parent associations and with individual parents.</p><p>I plan to make an announcement shortly on draft legislation that will replace Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 and require every school to publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter in accordance with national guidelines. These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

In that context, it has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in, Droichead, the new model of induction for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers. The model ensures that the same standards and requirements apply to all teachers who have gained conditional registration with the Teaching Council. Droichead was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Teaching Council in March 2016. </p>  <p>  The growth and development phase of Droichead commenced in September 2016 and by 2018 the Droichead model will be available to all newly qualified teachers to enable them to gain full registration with the Teaching Council. As part of the growth phase, the Council indicated that from September 2016, newly qualified teachers in mainstream settings may complete probation in the traditional manner, through the completion of a period of satisfactory service in a school and through the demonstration of professional competence in a school setting. The evaluation of professional competence is conducted by the Inspectorate.</p>  <p>  However, probation by the Inspectorate will not be possible in a special education or restricted setting but teachers in these setting can avail of the Droichead process to gain full registration with the Council. </p>  <p>  The INTO issued a directive to its members not to co-operate with or participate in Droichead or any form of probation or induction that does not include fully external evaluation for all NQTs, with effect from 1 July 2016. Their action will impact on the induction/probation process for NQTs in special education settings with effect from September 2016.  </p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that under the recent pay measures agreed with the INTO for new entrant teachers there will be an immediate time-bound engagement involving the relevant parties to resolve issues with the teacher induction process (Droichead), including issues giving rise to the current union directive on non-cooperation. I would therefore encourage the INTO to engage with the Teaching Council as the statutory professional standards body for teaching to clarify the concerns that it has about Droichead.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in Co Donegal and has replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department over the last decade or so. The following towns in County Donegal are now served by modern fire stations with full facilities: Milford (1998); Buncrana (2000); Letterkenny (HQ) and An Fal Carrach (both in 2003); Carndonagh and Donegal Town (both in 2004); Killybegs (2005); An Clochan Liath, Glenties and Moville (all in 2007); and most recently Gaoth Dobhair and Stranorlar (2009). My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years and as a consequence, the high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure is now widely acknowledged.   </p>  <p>  My Department, earlier this year, announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on the current annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. Under this programme, sixteen new-build fire stations are to be provided and ten fire stations are to be upgraded. The projects in the capital programme will be reassessed on an annual basis and priority may be adjusted to bring forward projects offering best value-for-money and to take account of the state of readiness of the projects.   </p>  <p>  The provision of a new fire station in Ballyshannon has been the subject of discussions for a number of years. While this station is not included in the five year programme referred to above, my Department is liaising with Donegal County Council and has indicated clearly that it will consider a proposal for advancing a fire station project in the south of the county to finalise the fire station programme in Donegal. I understand that the Council is undertaking a process to inform a fire station proposal, with a view to its submission to my Department by end 2016.   </p>  <p>  In further considering any proposal, my Department will have regard to established national priorities for funding in this area and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, as well as the value for money offered by the proposal.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.  Under the Act, enforcement of RTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  Given the demand for enforcement, it is not sustainable for the RTB to initiate proceedings on all requests.  As the Board was established to take cases out of the Courts, it endeavours to secure enforcement initially by non-judicial means.</p>  <p>  While there is no legal obligation on the RTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2015 alone, it referred 312 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment, of an award.  In many cases the best option - and one which the RTB facilitates - is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p>  <p>  Section 124 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides for the enforcement of RTB determination orders in the Circuit Court. Section 57 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 amends section 124 to provide for the enforcement of RTB determination orders through the District Court rather than the Circuit Court.  This will considerably reduce the expense of enforcing a determination order and may in some cases provide for faster hearings, as there are more sittings of the District Court than the Circuit Court.  Section 57 is subject to a Commencement Order which will be made in the coming months.</p></reply>

It is my aim that all reasonable steps are taken to secure the re-use of vacant and under-utilised properties for residential purposes, particularly in the many towns and villages in rural Ireland that contain a significant number of empty houses. Action 5.1 of the Action Plan provides for the development of a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017 and I intend to examine the potential to widen the geographical range of social housing location options available to persons seeking such accommodation.  The Strategy will examine the potential for bringing existing but vacant housing back into beneficial use and I intend to examine mechanisms to match such accommodation potential to prospective applicants for social housing, through measures such as the Repair and Leasing Initiative, which will see up-front financial assistance being made available to upgrade empty, but sub-standard, accommodation in return for leasing the property back for social housing purposes. Acquisition and leasing options are also available to local authorities to ensure that households needing accommodation may be provided with that accommodation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has overall responsibility for regional and rural matters and is advancing a broadly based rural development strategy, in the context of the Programme for a Partnership Government.  In conjunction with this overarching Strategy, the development of a rural resettlement programme will be considered further in the context of taking forward the range of measures set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.   </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I have no plans at present to make funding available to Rural Resettlement Ireland.</p></reply>

The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing. </p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness emphasises the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery of social housing by Approved Housing Bodies.  In that context, it states that support will be provided to an Irish Council for Social Housing/sector led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors which could potentially include the credit union movement.</p>  <p>  Credit union representative bodies have also set out a proposed means by which funding could be provided by credit unions to Approved Housing Bodies for the development of social housing.  My Department and the Department of Finance have met with these bodies on a number of occasions to examine how credit unions can assist in the area of social housing.  To date no reference has been made during those meetings to either section 44 of the Credit Union Act 1997 nor to the use of dormant accounts in credit unions for such funding purposes.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016.  Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications, including to Regulation 25(2), which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. </p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  My Department and the Department of Finance met with the Central Bank on 21 April 2016 to provide information of a technical nature in relation to social housing funding arrangements.  This was with a view to assisting the Central Bank in understanding how these arrangements operate, as it deals with issues arising from proposals put forward for credit union investment in social housing.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the funding mechanisms required will have to be put in place in the first instance by the credit union bodies themselves, with the support of their members and with the agreement of the Central Bank.  My Department will continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.</p></reply>

In relation to the specific case raised, I understand that as part of the normal administration of the scheme, the Housing Agency has offered the property to a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) but each has declined to purchase it from the lender at the price the lender has set.  This is because the value of the works that are required to bring the property to the standard for social housing makes the purchase of the property by an AHB financially unviable.  At this point there is nothing further that the scheme can offer this borrower in these circumstances.  I would therefore encourage the borrowers to re-engage with their lender to establish if there are other options available to them to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.  I would also encourage the borrower to contact their local authority with regard to their particular long term housing needs.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and has included a review of the MTR Scheme for borrowers of private commercial lending institutions as an action in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The review will examine what amendments can be made to the scheme to make it work better for borrowers.  My Department has commenced work on scoping the review and in this regard has begun early consultations with key stakeholders.  The review is to be complete by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has established a new scheme to help people who are insolvent and in serious mortgage arrears on their home to access free, independent, expert advice.  The Scheme of Aid and Advice for People in Mortgage Arrears provides financial and/or legal advice and assistance to people in this situation.  The aim of the Scheme is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them wherever possible, in their own homes.  This service may also be of assistance to this particular borrower, and I would recommend that they contact their local MABS office for advice and assistance.</p></reply>

To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group to inform the Strategy, with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself. Its first meeting was held on 30 September.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency are liaising with local authorities and with the Central Statistics Office in order to obtain a better understanding of the numbers, characteristics and reasons why homes are vacant. A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is being undertaken in this area.   </p>  <p>There are a number of new schemes recently announced that will specifically target vacant properties.  A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) will assist local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to bring vacant private houses into social housing use, providing homes for families on local authority waiting lists.  The new Scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow and my Department will work closely with other local authorities to roll it out around the country over the course of the next six months.  I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this Scheme over the next five years.  This Scheme has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021. </p>  <p>In addition, under a new &ldquo;Buy and Renew&rdquo; initiative, my Department will support local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, and renew them with the aim of making them available for social housing use.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million will be available for this initiative in 2017.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in relation to under-utilised and vacant lands, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, enacted in July 2015, introduced a new measure, the vacant site levy, which is aimed at incentivising the development of vacant, under-utilised sites in urban areas.  Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017, and to issue annual notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June 2018 in respect of vacant sites on the register on 1 January 2018.  The levy will be applied by planning authorities, commencing on 1 January 2019 in respect of sites which were vacant and on the vacant site register during the year 2018 and will subsequently be applied on an annual basis thereafter, as long as a site remains on the vacant site register in the preceding year. </p>  <p>  Planning authorities are empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.5 hectares in area - with reduced or zero rates of levy applying in specific circumstances &ndash; which, in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion, were vacant or idle in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development.  The 3% rate of vacant site levy is consistent with the rate applied to derelict sites under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and is considered reasonable, without being over-punitive, for the purposes of incentivising the activation of such sites for residential or regeneration purposes.  In this regard, it is also worth noting that all levies due on an individual site remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.  Accordingly, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year a site remains vacant or idle. </p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites will be used by planning authorities for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their collection and administration costs.</p>  <p>  Regarding urban regeneration in general, the Programme for a Partnership Government sets out the ambitious priority attached to it and incorporates a series of specific actions aimed at facilitating the regeneration of our urban centres . The Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan further reinforces its commitment to this area.  In this context, a Working Group, comprising of senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and other relevant bodies, has been established to bring forward proposals for new urban regeneration measures by the end of the year.  It is intended that the new measures will complement the existing regeneration programme under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Capital Programme, as well as other social regeneration initiatives already under way.</p></reply>

This therefore includes a mix of units from the existing housing stock and newly built units.  Overall, it is estimated that around 4,700 units could be secured for social housing from Part V agreements.  For 2017, the estimated breakdown and method of delivery for social housing includes 2,350 units to be delivered by local authorities through construction activity (i.e. new build and refurbishment/regeneration), 75 units to be acquired by local authorities, with the equivalent figures for AHBs being 550 and 1,175.  It is expected that some 300 additional new units will be built and made available for social housing via Part V mechanisms and will be owned by either local authorities or AHBs.  These figures do not include new social units that will be delivered via other methods such as long-term leasing or households who will have their needs met through the Housing Assistance Payment or Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p></reply>

Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants in accordance with the relevant local authority's allocation scheme.  In 2017, 2,250 new social housing units are targeted to be funded under the SHCEP programme.  In addition, the Programme will also fund the ongoing cost of the almost 8,000 existing units that are already being used for social housing under the Programme.  These new units will be delivered using a variety of different streams, including properties which will be newly constructed and acquired by AHBs.

This data will allow my Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to those most in need.  The summary process requires all housing authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support to ensure that the details of the applicant households are up to date and accurate and that they are still eligible for, and in need of, social housing support.  All local authorities then submit their returns electronically to a central IT system managed by the Local Government Management Agency.

The scheme has been rolled out on an incremental basis and is currently operational in 19 local authority areas, currently supporting more than 14,000 households, including eligible homeless households, and some 9,500 separate landlords and agents acting on behalf of landlords are receiving a monthly HAP payment. HAP payments can also be made to a Trust, as I understand is the case referred to here.  Upon commencement of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in a local authority administrative area, the availability of Rent Supplement support is altered and in general Rent Supplement will no longer be available to any new applicant households that have an identified long-term housing need. </p>  <p>  Local authorities, where HAP is operational, are working closely with local Department of Social Protection staff to transfer eligible households from the Rent Supplement scheme to HAP.  Tenants who are currently in receipt of Rent Supplement and who qualify for social housing support will be transferred to HAP over time.  The process of transferring households from Rent Supplement to HAP is carefully managed in order to ensure that no gaps in support arise within the transfer process.</p>  <p>  A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are getting one of certain payments, which includes HAP, so landlords can no longer state when advertising accommodation that HAP is not accepted.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts. </p>  <p>  The operation of the Rent Supplement scheme is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

A &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments will commence from March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment (including jobseekers on age-related reduced rates of payment).</p>  <p>  Approximately 1.5 million people will benefit from this increase, from pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, maternity and paternity benefit recipients and jobseekers.</p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) claimants under the age of 26 generally receive age-related reduced rates of payment.  Age-related reduced rates of payment do not apply in certain circumstances, however, such as when the claimant has a dependent child, or transferred to JA from Disability Allowance, or was in State care during the 12 months prior to applying for JA.</p>  <p>  There are no age-related reduced rates of payment for the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit scheme, which is based on a person&rsquo;s social insurance record.  Accordingly, young people who are eligible for the maximum rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit will receive the full &euro;5 weekly increase from March.</p>  <p>  The cost of the proportional &euro;2.70 increase in the weekly rate of payment for jobseekers on the age-related reduced rate of payment for 18 to 24 year olds, from &euro;100 per week to &euro;102.70 per week, is &euro;3.2 million in a full year.  A &euro;5 increase, from &euro;100 per week to &euro;105 per week, would cost &euro;5.9 million in a full year.  These costs include increasing the qualified adult rate (&euro;100) by the same amount.</p>  <p>  The cost of the proportional &euro;3.80 increase in the weekly rate of payment for jobseekers on the age-related reduced rate of payment for 25 year olds, from &euro;144 per week to &euro;144.80 per week, is &euro;0.8 million in a full year.  A &euro;5 increase, from &euro;144 per week to &euro;149 per week, would cost &euro;1 million in a full year.  These costs include increasing the qualified adult rate from &euro;124.80 to &euro;128.10 per week.</p>  <p>  Increasing the &euro;100 and &euro;144 rates by &euro;5 per week, instead of proportionate increases, would cost an additional &euro;3 million or &euro;6.9 million in total in a full year.</p>  <p>  In 2017, it is estimated that there will be, on average, c. 22,515 young jobseekers on the &euro;100 per week rate of payment and c. 3,870 jobseekers on the &euro;144 per week rate of payment.</p>  <p>  The full year cost of bringing the lower age related rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to match the rates payable to people aged 266 and over is &euro;116 million (based on the proposed 2017 rates outlined in the Budget).</p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of my Department is to award proportionate increases for people who are on reduced rates of payment and for qualified adults.  If the full increase was awarded to some categories of people on reduced rates, and not to others, this would not be fair to others on reduced rates of payment.</p>  <p>  The rationale for having reduced rates of payment for young jobseekers in receipt of a means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s payment is to prevent young people from entering welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.</p>  <p>  Financial incentives already exist for young people taking up education, training and employment supports.  Young people participating in employment programmes such as Community Employment, Tus and Gateway already receive the full adult rate of payment, which is currently &euro;210.50 per week and will rose to &euro;215.50 next year.</p>  <p>  From next September, when a young jobseeker participates in my Department&rsquo;s Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment which will then be &euro;193 per week (for people of any age), as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on.</p>  <p>  This 21% increase represents an extra &euro;33 a week, and demonstrates the State&rsquo;s support for young jobseekers who seek to enhance their skills.  The rate payable to young jobseeker&rsquo;s who participate on Solas training courses is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The number of young people on the Live Register on jobseekers payments was close to 90,000 in 2010 and is now down to 34,000.  There is a continuing strong downward trend this year with the numbers down from 42,000 to 34,000 since the beginning of 2016.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment has fallen by 5 percentage points in the last year alone and it is now below the EU average.  Of course more remains to be done and I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by helping them into the workforce or education.</p></reply>

If the full allocation for any scheme is not required in any given year, funds will not be drawn down from the Exchequer.Various factors may have led to lower than estimated supervisory expenditure in 2015.  Approximately 50 supervisors per year retire from CE.  These supervisors are usually at the top of the pay scale and may subsequently be replaced with new supervisors at the entry point of the scale (and therefore the overall costs of supervision will decrease).  Supervisors who are on long-term sickness would not be receiving pay from their CE employment for the duration of the absence (they would instead appear as a cost against the illness benefit scheme).  If a Sponsor organisation took some time to fill a CE supervisor vacancy, this would also reduce the supervision expenditure.  Another possible factor is supervisors requesting reductions in their working hours (which also reduces their salary <i>pro rata</i>).</p><p>It should also be noted that with the improving economy and reducing numbers on the Live Register, there is a lessening demand for places on employment schemes such as CE and this is also leading to reduced overall expenditure.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.976 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.</p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;228 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 420,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew, arising from the increased number of pension recipients. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.</p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This has increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, it was announced that there will be a further increase in the rate of State pensions, by &euro;5, which will increase the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory) to &euro;238.30 in March of next year.</p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, which is the equivalent of over &euro;34 per month.  The value of these increases is in excess of the value of the telephone allowance previously provided.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index figures, there was slightly negative inflation in the 12 months to August 2016.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the telephone allowance would have to be considered in the context of next year&rsquo;s overall budgetary negotiations.  On this occasion, the Government has concentrated resources on increasing the rate of the pension, rather than on the Household Benefits package.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This grant has not ceased or been curtailed in any way.</p>  <p>  The grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for the grant to a stand-alone CSG section.  The stand-alone grant is not subject to a means test.  The grant is paid annually on the first Thursday in June and it is expected that in excess of 90,000 grants will be paid in 2016 at an estimated cost of &euro;157.6 million.</p>  <p>  The name was changed from the Respite Care Grant to the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant in Budget 2016 to ensure that carers are empowered to use the grant in a manner that suits their individual circumstances, which may include providing for a respite from their caring duties.  During the economic crisis this payment had been reduced by &euro;325, in Budget 2013, in order to protect the core weekly welfare payments which people receive, including disability payments, pensions and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  The amount of the CSG was increased by &euro;325 to &euro;1,700 in Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  Total Expenditure on grants to carers (Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant) increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to over &euro;877 million in 2015.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  The Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and pensions of public servants, including the age at which they may be required to retire.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect individual public servants will reflect their particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.  However, I understand that such public servants will, generally, be paid a public service pension upon reaching their respective retirement age, whether or not they have reached the age which applies for the State pension.  </p>  <p>  Whether someone will qualify for a State pension at age 66, or for an alternative social protection payment aged 65, will depend on a number of factors, including their personal circumstances.  In particular, it will depend upon whether their PRSI contributions were at the full rate - which provides for State pension coverage - or at a modified rate which does not, and which would often be associated with public servants.</p>  <p>  There are specific measures which apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  </p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group on fuller working lives was chaired this year by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and it reported in August.  Any question regarding the retirement age of public servants, and their public service pension arrangements, may be addressed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The loans under the scheme range from &euro;100 to a maximum of &euro;2,000, and have a maximum interest rate of 12% per annum.  Over 1,200 loans have been drawn down under the Scheme during the pilot with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.  The average individual loan value drawn down was &euro;500.  The focus of the pilot scheme was social welfare recipients who availed of the loans from their Credit Union and were facilitated, with their consent, in the repayment of such loans through the Household Budgeting facility, operated by An Post.  The deductions from their weekly social welfare payments were then transmitted on to the relevant Credit Union.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides for the roll-out and extension of the Personal Microcredit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, the Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim.  Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the loan scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.  To help advance this aim, I have written to all Credit Union Chairpersons and Managers, to encourage participation.  A small number of credit unions previously involved in the pilot scheme, including the credit union concerned, have not progressed to national roll-out for a variety of reasons.  Ultimately, participation in the scheme is a matter for each individual Credit Union to consider and decide upon.</p><p>The list of credit unions offering the scheme is updated regularly and is available at the attached link and on the <i>It Makes Sense</i>Facebook page. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In support of these commitments, the Department of Social Protection provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities.  These include the EmployAbility service, the Wage Subsidy Scheme, workplace adaptation grants and specialist training courses that are specially designed for people with disabilities.  These supports are estimated to cost almost &euro;44 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Irish Association of Supported Employment is one of a range of community and voluntary groups that advocate policies and proposals that seek to support people with disabilities find and keep paid employment of their own choosing.  While I acknowledge the valuable contribution that IASE is making in this area, the Department of Social Protection does not have a programme that provides core funding to national community and voluntary bodies. </p>  <p>  Funding of this nature is provided by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government through the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).  This scheme provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national community and voluntary organisations, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged.

Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  </p>  <p>  Participants receive the JobPath service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to facilitate the jobseeker completing training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is the sooner. If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  To date, some 63,000 jobseekers have been referred to the JobPath service and of these c.800 are from the Coolock and Kilbarrack Intreo Centres. Initial JobPath performance statistics are expected to be finalised by the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  My Department has put in place some special administrative provisions for older jobseekers. These provisions aim to help people during the transition from the labour force into retirement. These provisions recognise that older jobseekers may have more difficulty re-training and re-entering the workplace if they lose their job when they are near to retirement age. People over 65 who are claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (JB), and who have at least 156 PRSI contributions, can continue to receive JB until their 66th birthday even if their claim is due to end before that date. A person claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance and aged 62 or over, is not currently required to engage with the compulsory activation process and is not subject to penalty rates for non-engagement. However, such jobseekers can voluntarily avail of a range of supports (for example, training or employment support programmes) if they so desire. A person, who turns 62, is expected to complete the programme if already engaged in activation or currently taking part in an activation programme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I also discussed the situation in Syria and Aleppo in my meetings with EU and other international partners at the UN last month, as well as with UN Secretary-General Ban.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the Syrian conflict, Ireland has been clear that we believe that this is a crisis of political legitimacy and that only a political solution will be viable and sustainable.  We are clear that this must be &ldquo;Syrian-owned and Syrian-led&rdquo;.  We have also been consistent in condemning the pattern of systematic violence against civilians, in which 100,000s have been killed and millions more wounded or forced to flee violence and terrorism.  We have called for the protection of all civilians from military force and terrorism and the unimpeded provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need and full accountability on behalf of the victims of crimes under international law.</p>  <p>  It is clear from a wide range of reports that the Assad regime has been overwhelmingly responsible for the deaths of Syrians since the beginning of the uprising in March 2011.  The Commission of Inquiry established by UN Human Rights Council has reported findings of evidence that the Assad regime may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against the besieged population of Aleppo is a clear violation of international law.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities at my direction.  On behalf of the Irish people, I urge Russia to use all its influence in Syria to end these inhumane actions against a defenceless civilian population.</p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.  The suffering of the besieged population in Aleppo underlines both the urgency and importance of ensuring accountability for those responsible for these actions.</p>  <p>  The attacks have rightly appalled people across Ireland and around the world.</p>  <p>  As a Government we have placed huge emphasis on doing what we can to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, through provision of humanitarian aid.  Earlier this month I approved &euro;1.5 million for the ICRC for their work inside Syria and &euro;1 million to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees affected by the Syria crisis which, combined with our recent disbursement of &euro;5M to the Turkey Refugee Facility, brings our total contribution to the Syrian crisis to &euro;62M since 2012.</p></reply>

Ratification by national parliaments is not required.</p>  <p>  A qualified majority for the purposes of Article 50 is defined with reference to Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: at least 72% of the members of the Council representing the participating Member States (not to include the departing State), comprising at least 65% of the population of these States.  These thresholds are somewhat higher than those which apply to QMV in the normal legislative process.</p>  <p>  I would also note that any agreement on future relations between the EU and the UK would very probably, depending on the matters covered, require unanimous agreement among the Member States and ratification by national parliaments.</p>  <p>  Under the consent procedure, the European Parliament may accept or reject a proposed act by the majority of votes cast.</p>  <p>  While, beyond the consent procedure, Article 50 provides no formal role for the European Parliament in the negotiations, on 8 September the Parliament&rsquo;s Conference of Presidents appointed Guy Verhofstadt as its representative on Brexit matters.  I am confident that both the Council and the Commission appreciate the political importance of keeping the Parliament well briefed.</p></reply>

The figure spent to date in 2016 is &euro;9,556,000.  These figures include the rental costs of official accommodation for Heads of Mission and the rent reimbursements provided to other officers where necessary.  These figures also include certain costs which will be charged back to other Departments, as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade oversees the posting of officers seconded in from other Departments to serve at our missions overseas, e.g. at the Permanent Representation in Brussels.</p><p>There is currently a total of forty-eight properties rented by the State for Heads of Mission abroad - seven under Vote 27 and forty-one under Vote 28.  These normally serve as both homes and as locations for Irish community, business and cultural promotional events to advance Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests.  In this the Embassies frequently partner with State Agency partners.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also provides officers who serve the State abroad with rent reimbursements to enable them to rent suitable accommodation at post if required.  Rent reimbursement is only provided to officers who are not eligible to reside in State-provided accommodation.</p><p>Officers receiving rent reimbursement remain personally responsible for all payments in respect of beneficial services such as heating, electricity, telephone, internet, etc. in the same manner as would apply when they are based in Ireland.</p><p>Rent reimbursements are fixed for the duration of an officer&rsquo;s assignment abroad, apart from provisions provided for in leases for mandatory cost of living index increases.  Fluctuations occur due to currency changes and some rents may be paid over a 2 year period instead of monthly, based on local requirement.</p><p>The Department uses an independent advisory service to provide advice on appropriate rent levels in the locations in which it is based around the world.  The primary criterion in assessing rent reimbursement level is the size of an officer&rsquo;s family.  Other possible considerations would be to ensure safe and secure locations, proximity to schools and the Mission, as well as general health and safety concerns.  Assessments are also made as to the representational/promotional work associated with particular posts and if the property is likely to be frequently used for promotional work.</p><p>Many of our officers posted abroad are accompanied by their family, an important requirement which must be taken into account when determining an officer&rsquo;s rent ceiling.  Staff numbers posted abroad fluctuate during the year, as staffing requirements can change.</p><p><b>Cost of Accommodation Officers at Irish Missions Overseas</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Vote 27</th><th>Vote 28</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;1,528,000</td><td>&euro;11,233,000</td><td>&euro;12,761,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to date)</td><td>&euro;1,274,000</td><td>&euro;8,282,000</td><td>&euro;9,556,000</td></tr></table></p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to these issues is broadly consistent to that taken by comparable EU foreign ministries.</p></reply>

The network consists of 61 Embassies, 7 multilateral Missions, 11 Consulates General and one Representative Office.  The size and scale of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis having regard to clear national priorities and available resources, and must be on the basis of an anticipated and ongoing significant return for the State.  In addition to the country of primary accreditation, many Embassies also cover additional countries which enhances the cost-effectiveness of external representation.</p><p>As a small open economy, heavily dependent on exports, a strong diplomatic network overseas is critically important.  The Department of Foreign Affairs was given additional trade responsibilities in 2011 and its title was changed to the &lsquo;Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&rsquo; to reflect this.  Ambassadors and their teams play an active role in trade, assisting businesses, working with State agencies, and building important networks for Ireland.  The value of Irish goods exports alone in 2015 was &euro;111,038m, a 20% increase on 2014.  Ambassadors chair Local Market Teams in the 27 priority markets.</p><p>My Department, through the Mission network, performs a wide range of functions in support of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other states and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to our citizens overseas; engaging with and supporting Irish communities abroad, and managing Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programmes in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries.  The Department and Missions work in close coordination with the State Agencies towards the advancement of Irish business and economic interests.</p><p>While the total cost of Ireland's diplomatic service for 2016 is not available yet, the total cost of running our Missions abroad in 2015, the most recent year for which full year figures are available, was &euro;95,334,563.  This total includes the costs incurred in the Mission network and costs incurred at HQ which are directly attributed to Missions, such as salaries of officers posted abroad.</p><p>All our diplomats are civil servants; they are paid by the State and, as PAYE workers, are subject to the normal tax and social security obligations of civil servants.  The salary scales for all civil servants are determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The grades of officers serving as Ambassador abroad range from First Secretary upwards and the salary scales for the relevant grades are set out in the following table:</p><p>Pay scales with effect from 1 July 2013<table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Scale</th></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL I</td><td>&euro;185,350</td></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL II</td><td>&euro;176,350</td></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL III</td><td>&euro;167,300</td></tr><tr><td>DEPUTY SECRETARY </td><td>&euro;156,380</td></tr><tr><td>ASSISTANT SECRETARY</td><td>&euro;119,572; &euro;124,917; &euro;130,706; &euro;136,496</td></tr><tr><td>COUNSELLOR/PRINCIPAL (HIGHER)</td><td>&euro;81,080; &euro;84,247; &euro;87,425; &euro;90,591; &euro;93,297; &euro;96,148A; &euro;98,995B</td></tr><tr><td>PRINCIPAL</td><td>&euro;75,647; &euro;78,670; &euro;81,676; &euro;84,706; &euro;87,258; &euro;89,906A; &euro;92,550B</td></tr><tr><td>FIRST SECRETARY/ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL (HIGHER)</td><td>&euro;65,000; &euro;66,531; &euro;68,893; &euro;71,244; &euro;73,600; &euro;74,973; &euro;77,275A; &euro;79,552B</td></tr><tr><td>FIRST SECRETARY/ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL</td><td>&euro;61,966; &euro;64,257; &euro;65,000; &euro;65,000; &euro;67,074; &euro;68,293; &euro;70,416A; &euro;72,546B</td></tr><tr><td>Pay scales for established officers appointed on or after the 6th April 1995</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL I</td><td>&euro;185,350</td></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL II</td><td>&euro;185,350</td></tr><tr><td>SECRETARY GENERAL III</td><td>&euro;175,877</td></tr><tr><td>DEPUTY SECRETARY</td><td>&euro;161,5521</td></tr><tr><td>ASSISTANT SECRETARY</td><td>&euro;125,761; &euro;131,385; &euro;137,481; &euro;143,535</td></tr><tr><td>COUNSELLOR/PRINCIPAL (HIGHER)</td><td>&euro;85,127; &euro;88,454; &euro;91,798; &euro;95,135; &euro;97,981; &euro;100,977A; &euro;103,976B</td></tr><tr><td>COUNSELLOR/PRINCIPAL</td><td>&euro;79,401; &euro;82,587; &euro;85,750; &euro;88,936; &euro;91,624; &euro;94,410A; &euro;97,194B</td></tr><tr><td>FIRST SECRETARY/ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL (HIGHER)</td><td>&euro;67,434; &euro;69,910; &euro;72,391; &euro;74,870; &euro;77,304; &euro;78,714; &euro;81,109A; &euro;83,510B</td></tr><tr><td>FIRST SECRETARY/ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL</td><td>&euro;65,000; &euro;65,000; &euro;66,040; &euro;68,262; &euro;70,479; &euro;71,758; &euro;73,995A; &euro;76,224B</td></tr></table></p><p>A.

This response known as the Minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicates whether the recommendation is accepted, or rejected by the Minister.  When a recommendation is accepted, the response explains how it has been, or will be implemented by the particular Government Department.  When a recommendation is not accepted the reasons for this are set out in the response in order to assist the Committee of Public Accounts in determining whether they wish to write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform further on the matter.</p>  <p>  When the Minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform response has been sent to the Committee of Public Accounts it is then incorporated into a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular and circulated to the Accounting Officers of all Government Departments for their attention and any necessary action arising from the recommendations.</p>  <p>  This process ensures that the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General that have cross-public service implications are communicated widely across the public service to seek to ensure that all appropriate steps are taken in response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations.</p></reply>

It is also listed on the local authority&rsquo;s Record of Protected Structures.  Under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority is required to include a Record of Protected Structures (RPS) in its development plan.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  There is a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  Financial support has been provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.  Such schemes are administered through the local authorities.  No application for funding has been received by my Department in respect of the structure in question.</p>  <p>  I understand that the building in question is vested with the Representative Church Body and that a fence was erected a number of years ago by the local authority as a precautionary measure.</p>  <p>  The local authority, in the first instance, can advise of funding available for conservation works to protected structures and it is advisable for both owners and interested parties to remain in contact with their local authority on an on-going basis regarding the on-going care and management of such historic assets.  </p></reply>

Officials from my Department met with representatives of Donegal County Council and the local Historical Society on site in late 2015 to discuss the possibility of taking the monument into State ownership.  My Department is currently assessing the feasibility of this proposal with the Office of Public Works.  The assessment will, in particular, include consideration of the availability of the funding and staffing resources necessary to address the conservation and ongoing maintenance needs of the site on a long-term basis.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, local supporters could investigate other State financial supports available to assist the conservation and preservation of heritage structures.  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of its research, education and conservation programmes, having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  The Council awarded funding of over &euro;880,000 to 171 heritage projects nationwide under its 2016 Heritage Management Grant Scheme.  Further details of the Council&rsquo;s grant schemes may be found on its website.</p>  <p>  The funding available for 2016 through the Structures at Risk Fund and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme, both run by my own Department through the local authorities, has been fully allocated.  The Structures at Risk Fund covers conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts and are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  It seeks to encourage the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and to help to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The Built Heritage Investment Scheme provides funding for the repair and conservation of protected structures and supports a significant number of projects across the country, providing employment in the conservation and construction industries while also helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  While details have yet to be finalised as regards schemes for 2017, they are again likely to be operated through the local authorities.</p></reply>

The Broadband Action Groups comprise officials from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and nominated staff from each Local Authority.  Both Groups met for the first time in the middle of September and will meet bimonthly for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  The key objective in establishing these Groups is to ensure that each Local Authority is fully prepared to facilitate the winning bidder(s) to commence work as soon as the procurement process for areas identified for State intervention under the National Broadband Plan is complete, and contracts have been signed next year.  This will be achieved by identifying barriers to the timely roll-out of broadband infrastructure and agreeing actions that can be taken to address those barriers.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities are also working to identify priority connection points for the advance roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure in their counties.  These strategic connection points will help to ensure early access to broadband at premises that are otherwise only likely to be reached towards the end of the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan.</p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing by Local Authorities in respect of the development of local digital strategies to ensure that once their counties are broadband enabled, they are capable of exploiting the economic and social opportunity at their disposal.</p></reply>

These provisions are contained in the Bill.  The regulations specified in Sections 8(1) and 8 (2) of the Bill relating to the pilot two year period will be finalised following enactment of the Heritage Bill by the Oireachtas and taking account of consultations with relevant stakeholders in due course.

The reason Roche withdrew the authorisation was commercial.  As the marketing authorisation for this product has been withdrawn in Ireland, the product information for Lariam is no longer available on the Health Products Regulatory Authority website.</p>  <p>  Prior to withdrawing the authorisation, Roche Products Limited, 6 Falcon Way, Shire Park, Welwyn Garden City, AL7 1TW United Kingdom was responsible for placing Lariam on the Irish market.  Roche was also responsible for the distribution of the product in Ireland and could contract any wholesaler, authorised by the HPRA, to distribute it in Ireland on their behalf.</p>  <p>  Although Roche does not market Lariam in Ireland now, it is possible for it to be sourced from another EU member state by an authorised wholesaler, to be supplied to the order of a prescriber, to meet the special needs of their patients.  Products supplied in this way are known as &lsquo;exempt medicines&rsquo; and are used under the direct responsibility of the prescriber.  Any Irish authorised wholesaler that sources exempt medicines is required to notify the HPRA.  Over the past three years there has been no notification to the HPRA of the sourcing of unauthorised (exempt) Lariam or other mefloquine containing product.</p>  <p>  It is also possible for a prescriber to source an exempt medicine direct from an authorised wholesaler in another EU member state.  In that event, there is no legal obligation on the wholesaler or the prescriber to notify the HPRA.</p>  <p>  In relation to the request for the names of licensed importers of Lariam, the active substance in Lariam, mefloquine, is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, so an import licence is not required for a medicine containing this substance.</p></reply>

Cyanide poisoning can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, joint and muscle aches and pains, and falling blood pressure.  In extreme cases, it can be fatal.</p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority in Ireland for human medicines.  If the product information or promotional material for any specific brand of apricot kernels claimed that the product can treat or prevent disease in humans, it would have to be authorised by the HPRA as a medicinal product before being put on the Irish market.  There are no medicines containing apricot kernels authorised by the HPRA and the HPRA does not endorse or support their use for the prevention or treatment of cancer.</p><p>However in many cases specific brands of apricot kernels will not make medicinal claims and may be marketed as foods.  Where apricot kernels are marketed as foods and do not make medicinal claims, they are regulated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) rather than the HPRA.  The HPRA is aware that the FSAI has advised consumers against eating apricot kernels due to the risk of cyanide poisoning and further information in this regard is available on the FSAI&rsquo;s website:</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F"></font></i><i><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></i></p><p>Any queries in relation to the marketing of apricot kernels as foods, the sourcing of foods from UK health stores, or the advice published on the FSAI website should be addressed to the FSAI as these aspects fall outside the remit of the HPRA.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.  Should a patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he or she should take the matter up with the consultant and the hospital involved.
