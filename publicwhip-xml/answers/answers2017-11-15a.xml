Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.</p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to my Department in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of detailed engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to my Department in September 2017. </p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in my Department.  Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties, to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise, will have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

In order to address long waiting times, the HSE has procured orthodontic services in primary care from a number of private service providers and a budget of &euro;1 million per annum is being dedicated to this initiative which commenced in 2016.  Approximately 400 patients from the north east are being treated under this programme.

In any event, as the HSE is not the employer, the Executive would not have a direct role in any such industrial action.  I understand that a number of Section 39 agencies have been before the Workplace Relations Commission and some have or are currently in the process of going to the Labour Court.  The HSE is not party to any such proceedings.</p>  <p>  Under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE has in place Service Level Agreements with voluntary providers which set out the level of service to be provided for the grant to the individual organisation. Any individuals employed by these Section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, therefore neither the HSE nor my Department has a role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff.  </p>  <p>  The staff of these Section 39 organisations are not public servants and therefore were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions.  It follows then that the staff of the Section 39 bodies will not be eligible for any pay restoration associated with the unwinding of this legislation and provided for under the more recent Public Service Agreements.  It is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services. </p>  <p>  As I understand it, pay cuts were imposed on Section 39 employees but it is not clear that these cuts were applied in a universally consistent manner across all the Section 39 agencies.  It is also important to recognise that this group of organisations within the health sector is just one element of a larger complex issue which could have significant cost implications for the Exchequer across the public services as a whole.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I have had discussions with my colleague Minister Donohoe and will continue to engage with him on this matter.</p></reply>

The bid was developed by a cross-sectoral working group, led by my Department, with colleagues from the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, IDA Ireland and other Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  Since its submission, promotion of the Dublin bid has continued at political and diplomatic levels. Our bid has been promoted by our EU missions as well as at Ministerial level by myself and my colleagues. In addition, officials from my Department have held a series of bilateral engagements to promote our bid with different Member States over the last number of weeks to discuss and promote the respective bids.</p>  <p>  There is strong competition from 18 other Member States to act as host, which reflects the prestige and opportunity provided by becoming the new home of the EMA. </p>  <p>  The vote on the agency&rsquo;s new location will be taken at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) on 20 November. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will represent Ireland at this meeting.</p></reply>

If the applicant has obtained his or her nurse or midwife qualification in an EU/EEA country, they are entitled to have their qualifications assessed pursuant to the Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/36/EC.  If their qualifications fall under this Directive, they are entitled to have qualifications automatically recognised. </p>  <p>  With regard to other applicants, if the theoretical or clinical components of their training programme show deficits not compensated for by professional experience, then the applicant will have to successfully complete an adaptation and assessment period of 6-12 weeks or an aptitude test.  There is no aptitude test available for midwifery, psychiatry, children&rsquo;s and intellectual disability nursing.</p>  <p>  Where the NMBI determines that a period of adaptation is required, and the nurse has a conditional offer of employment in the Irish health service, they will then undertake adaptation and assessment at a hospital, in order to register and take up the post - 7 such programmes have been run with respect to nursing homes since July 2016 and a further 2 are scheduled for April &amp;amp; June 2018.  The Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals (DATHs) have been recruiting and providing clinical adaptation and assessment on an ongoing basis since 2015. </p>  <p>  At present 21 public sector acute hospitals are listed on the NMBI website as approved to provide periods of adaptation and assessment to candidate nurses seeking registration on the general division of the nurses register held by the NMBI.  These hospitals provide adaptation and assessment to candidate nurses - many of these hospitals and all DATHs have provided these programmes in 2017.  The provision of such programmes is driven by service need and availability of appropriate candidates &ndash; it is not provided routinely as with other academic programmes.</p>  <p>  The Royal College of Surgeons Ireland offer a 2 day assessment process for registration and all details are on their website which provides information on this aptitude test.  The fee is &euro;2,800. It is understood that payment of fees for candidates who have undertaken the test has been predominantly by their employer.  The HSE pays this fee for candidates who have been given a provisional offer of employment.  The aptitude test that is currently open will be held on 28 January 2018, a further five tests have been held in the interim.  Since the two day assessment process commenced less than two years ago, the RCSI have had 1,700 applicants and have been able to respond in a positive and proactive way to the needs of the Irish health service and the applicants concerned. </p>  <p>  To attend either the clinical adaptation and assessment programme or the aptitude test, candidates should ensure to allow sufficient time to obtain immigration authorisations.</p></reply>

The implementation of <i></i>'<i>A Vision for Change</i>' has been given specific priority in recent years with the additional ring-fenced funding, specifically aimed at modernising mental health services in line with the Programme for Government commitments.  A key focus has been approval of some 1,550 additional posts to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams; enhancing specialist community mental health and forensic services, increasing access to counselling and psychotherapy; and developing suicide prevention initiatives.  These posts are directly facilitating the policy of moving away from traditional institutional based care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service.  Staff recruitment and retention has been a challenge for the HSE for various reasons, with approximately two thirds of these posts filled so far in certain CHO areas. </p><p>CHO 2 serves a population of 109,784 people aged 0-18 years.  Adjusted for population changes, <i>A Vision for </i>Change recommendations would result in a total of 114 Whole Time Equivalents (WTEs) required across all CAMHS teams.  Currently, there are 66 WTEs in post, and a further 3 approved and funded posts under recruitment, i.e. nearly 61% of the recommended level.  CHO2 works closely with the HSE Mental Health Division to prioritise additional funding for continued investment in CAMHS.  Continuing Programme for Government funding will support the implementation of <i>Vision for Change</i>recommendations.</p><p>The HSE National Service Plans of recent years also highlight the broad range of ongoing reforms in mental health services including CAMHS.  The Department of Health is currently advancing a review of  '<i>A Vision for Change</i>' <i>.</i>Having commissioned an Expert Evidence Review (completed in February 2017), an Oversight Committee has been established to begin the process of updating our mental health policy.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The HSE wants to assure the public that its community services are there to care and support.

It is recognised that early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively and this process is well under way.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend. </p>  <p>  Currently there are a number of key vacancies in the Disability Services in Co. Wexford.  All posts are approved and are with the National Recruitment Services for permanent filling. </p>  <p>  With regard to Autism specifically, at the request of  the Minister for Health, the HSE is conducting a review of services across the country to identify existing models of best practice. </p></reply>

Linn Dara is a 24 bed unit that has been operational since December 2015. </p>  <p>  Referrals are accepted for persons under the age of 18, where the severity and complexity of the presenting mental health disorder is such that treatment at primary care service level has been unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  The service provides assessment and treatment through a multi-disciplinary team for young people, and their families, who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  On 2nd June 2017, due to previous difficulties in recruiting Psychiatric Nursing staff, and taking into account other factors such as quality and safety, a decision was made to temporarily reduce the operational capacity at Linn Dara to 11 beds.  During the time of reduced capacity, all young persons were discharged based on appropriate clinical decisions, and with a detailed Care Plan and appropriate Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team follow-up.</p>  <p>  The HSE has actively engaged in a recruitment process for nursing staff for this facility.  Every effort was made to re-open beds at the earliest opportunity.  The Executive continues to work with all the key stakeholders, including Unions, regarding innovative ways of ensuring provision of this vital service. </p>  <p>  In September 2017, following a recruitment campaign, graduate Psychiatric Nurses were recruited for Linn Dara.  As of 31st October 2017, there are the required number of staff in place to return the Unit to its approved capacity.  Currently, 22 beds in Linn Dara have been re-opened, and 2 High Observation beds are also available for referrals.</p></reply>

The Assembly first considered the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Article 40.3.3), and submitted its final report, setting out its recommendations, to the Oireachtas on 29 June 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution is now considering the report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in order to recommend to the Oireachtas the policy direction it should consider on the issue.  The first public meeting of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, chaired by Senator Catherine Noone, was on 20 September.  The Committee is to report its conclusions and recommendations to both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of its first public meeting, which would therefore be due on or before 20 December 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed to hold a referendum on the Eighth Amendment in May or June 2018 subject to the timely passage of a Constitutional Amendment Bill on the matter by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I have great regard for the important body of work with which the Special Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution has been charged, and look forward to its report in due course.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is seeking to explore and research the issue so that, in so far as is feasible, as much preparation as possible can be drawn upon once the Special Joint Committee finalises its recommendations.  This will be important if we are to complete the process in line with the timetable set out by Government.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country.  The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  This will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and officials from the Department of Health and the HSE meet with GP representatives on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached with GP representatives in the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018.  This will be the start of a multi-annual change process that will enhance the role of primary care as the foundation of a more accessible and effective health service.</p></reply>

As I have previously stated, the Review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  A Steering Group is overseeing the project, with support from external consultants commissioned to provide technical, analytical and engagement expertise.  An independent international peer review group is involved in ongoing review and validation of the methodology and approach.  My Department has also undertaken a public consultation process to ensure that stakeholder views are fed into the process.</p>  <p>  The findings from the Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity that is needed at a national and regional level.

I expect to receive the final report of the Capacity Review by the end of the year.   </p>  <p>  In terms of staffing, in line with our Statement of Strategy 2016-2019, my Department has developed a National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning in collaboration with a Cross-Sectoral Steering Group.

The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It provides community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. </p>  <p>  Travellers have been identified as a priority group within Connecting for Life.  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups.  Responsibility for monitoring and reporting systems to support the delivery of the Strategy has been assigned to the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).  Some key achievements of this Strategy have included the on-going provision of free, evidence-informed suicide and self-harm training in communities nationwide with over 9,000 individuals completing training in 2016, and the successful delivery of the #littlethings mental health and wellbeing campaign.  NOSP also support the work of 21 Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention across Ireland, guiding their strategic development of local Connecting for Life action plans.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, in July 2017, the Department of Rural and Community Development announced the approval of the 2017 Dormant Accounts Action Plan.  Additional funding of up to &euro;3.46 million is being made available to the Department of Health in the period 2017-2019 to support a wide range of marginalised service users including refugees, transgender persons, Travellers, Roma, people with dementia and older people. </p>  <p>  Under this is a specific mental health initiative for Travellers, which has been allocated &euro;500,000.  The aim of this measure is to develop Traveller mental health initiatives to reduce suicide and improve mental health outcomes for Travellers.  These initiatives include maintaining and promoting positive mental health and wellbeing, and improving Traveller access to mainstream mental health services through the development of culturally appropriate services.  This proposal is in line with the actions proposed in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, which was also launched this year.  </p></reply>

The Government has allocated an additional &euro;646 million in current expenditure to Health in Budget 2018, including funds for an additional 1,800 front line staff.  The overall Health budget for 2018 is almost &euro;15.3 billion.  The HSE is currently finalising the 2018 Service Plan and will allocate the additional posts in accordance with service demands. </p><p>The HSE has been focused on increasing the number of frontline staff over the past three years as the budgetary position has improved and progress has been made in growing the consultant, NCHD and nursing workforce.  At the end of September 2017 there were 2,951 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 126 more than the end September 2016 figure and an increase of 666 in the past decade. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly.  At the end of September 2017 there were 6,286 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 311 compared with the end of September 2016 number and an increase of over 1,394 in the past decade.  The HSE has been focused on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment.  It is now giving effect to the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016.  It is also focused on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of NCHDs.</p><p>Recruitment of nurses and midwives is a key priority this year. Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of September 2017 stood at 36,170 whole time equivalents.  The number of nursing posts has increased by 632 in the 12 months from end September 2016 and by over 2,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in the four years from end September 2013 to end September 2017.  The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017.  The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts.  The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts.  This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter, following registration.</p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018. The outcome of its assessment will be subject to discussions between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. </p>  <p>  The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise Hospital.  A draft plan was submitted to my Department in December 2016.  This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of detailed engagement between Department officials and the HSE.  Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to my Department in September 2017. </p>  <p>  The report is currently under detailed consideration in my Department. Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended that there will be further engagement with all interested parties, to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.  Any future changes to services at Portlaoise, will have to take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.</p></reply>

The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs, having regard to the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, work on the Health Service Capacity Review is progressing.  The review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities including Tallaght Hospital.  As part of the review process, my Department has commissioned external consultants to provide technical, analytical and engagement expertise.  A Steering Group is overseeing the project and an independent international peer review group is involved in ongoing review and validation of the methodology and approach.  My Department has also undertaken a public consultation process to ensure that stakeholder views are fed into the process.</p>  <p>  The findings from the Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity that is needed at a national and regional level.  The emerging findings from the review will inform the development of a new 10 year national capital plan later this year.  The final report will be published before the end of the year. </p></reply>

The Government has allocated an additional &euro;646 million in current expenditure to Health in Budget 2018, including funds for an additional 1,800 front line staff.  The overall Health budget for 2018 is almost &euro;15.3 billion.  The HSE is currently finalising the 2018 Service Plan and will allocate the additional posts in accordance with service demands. </p><p>The HSE has been focused on increasing the number of frontline staff over the past three years as the budgetary position has improved and progress has been made.  At the end of September 2017 there were 2,951 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 126 more than the end September 2016 figure and an increase of 666 in the past decade.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly. At the end of September 2017 there were 6,286 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 311 compared with the end of September 2016 number and an increase of over 1,394 in the past decade.  </p><p>Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of September 2017 stood at 36,170 whole time equivalents.  The number of nursing posts has increased by 632 in the 12 months from end September 2016 and by over 2,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in the four years from end September 2013 to end September 2017.  The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017.  The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts.  It is important to bear in mind however that most student nurses graduate in the autumn.  The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts.  This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter, following registration.</p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018. The outcome of its assessment will be subject to discussions between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, at the recent meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health, the issue of adult safeguarding was extensively discussed.  The Department outlined its intention to the Committee, subject to Government approval, to explore the development of an appropriate adult safeguarding policy for the health sector underpinned with such legislation as may be required.  </p>  <p>  The scope and content of a health sector policy on safeguarding and any legislation required will be informed by a major review by the HSE of its safeguarding policy, comprehensive policy and legal research, consultation with other Government Departments, key stakeholders and the public, and extensive evidence based policy analysis.  However, I am hopeful that preliminary proposals on a high level approach can be brought to Government shortly.  The development of health policy and legislation in this area is a complex undertaking and will, of necessity, take time and it is important that such proposals are built on the foundations of a clear, carefully considered, coherent and implementable policy.  </p></reply>

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  The issue of orphan medicines, with very small patient populations, and the price barriers for health systems in supplying them to patients, is world-wide.  Orphan product manufacturers have exclusive patents and are monopoly suppliers.  They can, and frequently do, seek very high prices for these products.</p>  <p>  The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments. However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas.  In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 Framework Agreement with industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Criteria which must be considered include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs.  However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and in such cases this must be sought.  Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought by the company, lengthy price negotiations between the HSE and the manufacturer may be needed. These factors contribute significantly to the length of the reimbursement decision making process.</p>  <p>  With the potential costs involved and the competing demands across the health service, every effort must be made to secure the best outcome for the health service and the taxpayer.  This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.</p></reply>

The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  Last month, I was pleased to launch the Programme&rsquo;s detailed Implementation Plan for the Strategy. </p>  <p>  I am advised that anomaly scans are available in each hospital group.  I am also advised that those maternity hospitals/units that currently provide anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that such a scan is clinically indicated.  I am assured that the Programme will continue to work with the maternity networks to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those hospitals and units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  In relation to University Hospital Galway, I understand that the maternity unit currently provides pregnant women with access to an anomaly scan.  The HSE has advised that, while the hospital has experienced staffing changes in recent weeks, the anomaly scanning service remains in place.  It has also advised that every effort is being made to recruit additional staff to support the anomaly scanning service into the future.  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the detailed queries concerning the staffing complement, vacancies and recruitment process.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, and in demonstration of the Government's commitment to improve maternity care, I can confirm that additional funding will be provided for anomaly scanning in 2018, the detail of which will be set out in the National Service Plan 2018. </p></reply>

Within this context, trolley numbers and patient experience times are showing small improvements on this time last year. As of 13 November,  HSE data shows that there was 1.2% or 1,025 less patients waiting on trolleys this year as compared to the same period last year, notwithstanding the increased demand. </p>  <p>  In addition several hospitals are showing significant improvement in terms of trolley numbers with HSE data to the end of September showing Mayo University Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and Beaumont Hospital showing reductions in trolley numbers ranging from 30% to 40% as compared to the same period in 2016. </p>  <p>  Tackling overcrowding in Emergency Departments is a key commitment of this Government and I am happy to confirm that &euro;40 million in additional funding in 2017 has been made available as part of the 2018 Budget to address winter pressures and waiting lists over the rest of this year.  A further &euro;45 million has been allocated for measures to improve access to unscheduled care and other acute hospital priorities in 2018. </p>  <p>  Some of this funding is already being utilised within the system, with an additional 45 homecare packages and 20 transitional care beds per week being provided for the duration of the winter period.  This funding will allow for patients to return home, or an appropriate community setting, when clinically appropriate, thus helping to alleviate some of the pressures our hospitals are currently experiencing.  </p>  <p>  Funding will also be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and moving forward, as part of service planning for 2018.  The Department of Health is also undertaking a Health Service Capacity review in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published before the end of the year, and which will provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm that all Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their locality focussed on planning and escalation preparedness, maintaining patient flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness. </p></reply>

This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance with National Standards.  </p><p>This investment programme will see the provision of two new centres in Donegal, namely in Ballyshannon and also a 130 bed centre, centrally located in Letterkenny.</p><p>Since the announcement in 2016, and following discussions with public representatives, Health Forum members and local community groups, local HSE management in CHO 1 agreed to review overall requirements for the area. The Terms of Reference for the Rhatigan's review were as follows:</p><p>1. Assess current and future needs for short/long term bed capacity taking into account of up to date census data from the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>2. Based on current planning norms define scale of public/private provision required to meet this need up to 2026.</p><p>3. Assess the adequacy of existing facilities in St Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital Stranorlar, Ramelton and Lifford, taking account of amended legislation governing residential care standards 2016.</p><p>4. Recommend changes to the approved capital programme, if appropriate, taking into account capital and revenue costs, geographical factors, integration of care with acute services and time frames for delivery.</p><p>5. Make specific recommendations regarding dementia care provision.</p><p>6. Based on the above to finalise brief and options appraisals for infrastructural developments proposed.</p><p>I understand that the review has been completed and a report is to be submitted to the HSE&rsquo;s National Social Care Division in the first instance, and then the HSE&rsquo;s National Capital Property Steering Group.</p><p>Any proposals for changes to the approved Capital Investment Programme for Community Nursing Units would have to be considered in the context of capital funding available to Health, potential revenue implications and compliance with the agreed capital approval process. </p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  Budget 2018 allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;10m for the remainder of 2017 to fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the HSE has been implementing Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding. Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 29,000 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  </p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that to date 14,551 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Initiatives, 4,574 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,822 patients have received their procedure. The NTPF has also indicated that 3,716 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 1,415 offers of treatment have been accepted and 776 patients have been treated. Under the Oupatient Plan, since early February, almost 100,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List.</p>  <p>  The NTPF are undertaking an initiative to provide diagnostic endoscopy tests to an extra 700 patients who are waiting for scopes. Under this Initiative, the NTPF will provide an endoscopy procedure to an extra 700 of the longest-waiting patients. The NTPF is currently in the process of rolling this initiative, with outsourcing underway. The NTPF will work with public hospitals to identify those patients who will be offered outsourcing of their procedure to a private hospital.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2018, &euro;50m in funding will be allocated to the NTPF for patient treatment and a further &euro;10m to HSE to address waiting lists, including in the area of paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis.  The HSE and NTPF are working together to develop coherent and synergistic Waiting List Action Plans in 2018 for inpatient/daycase, outpatient and scoliosis, in order to continue the focus on long-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers.</p></reply>

The Plan is stimulating job creation and job retention across the region by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, in conjunction with the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland (EI) to support regional enterprise development projects. </p>  <p>  The core objective of the Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020. The Plan is also aiming to ensure that the regional unemployment rate is within the 1% of the State average. </p>  <p>  Sectors targeted as part of the plan include traditionally strong sectors for the region like agri-food, manufacturing/engineering and tourism. The Local Authorities, enterprise agencies, and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Cavan and Monaghan have been strongly involved in, and are key drivers of the Action Plan through an Implementation Committee.</p>  <p>  The second progress report on the implementation of the Action Plan, covering the period to June 2017, was published recently and shows that good progress was made. Over 96% of the actions due to be completed or progressed by June 2017 were on track.  The progress report is available at www.regionalapj.ie.</p>  <p>  Since this regional initiative was launched in January 2015, 6,000 jobs were created in the Border region. The unemployment rate in the region has also fallen from 10.2% in Q1 2015 to 6.6% in Q2 2017.  Furthermore, Live Register numbers have fallen in County Cavan by 16.4% and in County Monaghan by 14% in the past 12 months and by 45% and 51% respectively since 2012. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) play a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. In the period 2014 -2016, Enterprise Ireland provided over &euro;11m to client companies in Cavan and &euro;8m to Monaghan and has funded six Community Enterprise Centres which provide important enterprise hubs to these counties. </p>  <p>  In May of this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a new competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund to assist counties and regions build enterprise capability and capacity.  The Fund will support significant collaborative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  </p>  <p>  The LEOs in Cavan and Monaghan continue to provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector in 2017 and beyond through a partnership approach involving the Local Authorities and Enterprise Ireland.

Being cognisant of the financial pressures this can place on these students and their families, the Government provides assistance through a number of measures.</p>  <p>  The Free Fees Initiative was introduced in 1995 by the then Government to assist third level undergraduate students in publicly funded higher education institutions. Currently, under the terms of the Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution. The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. </p>  <p>  The student contribution charge currently stands at &euro;3,000 and applies to all full-time students who benefit under the Free Fees Initiative. However, it is important to recognise that the State pays this contribution (or part of it) on behalf of approximately 43% of undergraduate students as they qualify on means-tested grounds for exemption from the contribution under the Student Grants Scheme. </p>  <p>  Tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost of the student contribution. In addition, higher education institutions have provisions in place to allow students to pay the contribution in at least two moieties. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department provides financial support via the student grant scheme which makes means-tested financial assistance available to qualifying full-time registered students in higher education attending approved courses in the EU, EEA and the Swiss Confederation. Under the terms of the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students on full-time courses who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. In 2017 approximately &euro;380m will be invested in student grants. </p>  <p>  Higher education is a central part of our plan as a Government to support a strong economy and deliver a fair society. However, there is a significant cost to providing higher education opportunities and these costs have to be met. The most appropriate means of meeting these costs was considered by the expert group on future funding which reported to me in 2016. The expert group's report sets out a number of options for a long term sustainable funding model for the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, I referred the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations which will assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.</p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education. This commitment is reflected in Budget 2018 in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018. This funding is on top of the &euro;36.5m that I secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018. In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 than in 2016.</p>  <p>  This additional funding will allow for targeted initiatives in higher education including skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the sector. It will also allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Where textbook publishers wish to produce books for any particular subject, this is entirely at the discretion of publishers. Equally, it is at the discretion of teachers and schools should they wish to use textbooks where these are available. The Department, through both the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), has provided training, guidance and resources for teachers in Politics and Society since Phase One of the subject&rsquo;s introduction began in 2016, and will continue to provide such support, including online support. Participating teachers have also been supporting each other by pooling and sharing resources, with the encouragement of the PDST. As this subject is so strongly rooted in current affairs, and is so strongly linked with active, student-centred methodologies, these are other factors which suggest that the absence of textbooks should not be seen as a drawback to delivery of the subject in any way. </p><p>The Department has had no involvement in any apparent guarantee to produce textbooks by September 2017, but is happy to advise that sample examination papers have now been made available by the State Examinations Commission.

These measures were designed not to harm the Venezuelan population, whose plight the EU wishes to alleviate. Ireland fully supports the introduction of these measures, which is in line with our foreign policy position on the promotion and protection of human rights, and which builds on the Council Conclusions of July 2016 and May 2017 in addressing continued concerns at the situation in Venezuela and the many challenges facing the country.    I have on previous occasions expressed my profound concern at the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, a country faced with grave political, economic, and humanitarian crises.  During the summer, there were almost daily mass protests and violence across the country, resulting in dozens of deaths in clashes between security forces and opposition demonstrators.  The reported human rights violations, excessive use of force, and mass detentions were unacceptable.  The continued political polarisation of Venezuela is deeply worrying, and has been exacerbated by the establishment by the government of a constituent assembly which is not recognised by Ireland or the European Union. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland, along with its EU partners, will continue to monitor the situation closely.  It is my hope that the restrictive measures we agreed last Monday, 13 November, in the Foreign Affairs Council will, in addition to political and diplomatic efforts, assist in fostering a peaceful negotiated solution through credible and meaningful dialogue. </p></reply>

Ireland is committed to contributing to international efforts to alleviate the immediate needs of the refugees that have entered Bangladesh, which now number over 600,000.  To this end, we pledged &euro;2m in direct support at the Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis in Geneva on 23 October. &euro;1m has already disbursed to civil society partners and international organisations that are providing services to vulnerable refugees in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar and two experts have been deployed via the Irish Aid Rapid Response Corps.  The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, to which Ireland contributes funding, have also scaled up their operations in operations in Bangladesh and in Myanmar.  My Department will continue to closely monitor the humanitarian situation as it unfolds.</p>  <p>  In addition to providing humanitarian support, my Department has been consistent in emphasising the need to bring an end to violence in Rakhine State, for full restoration of humanitarian aid and media access, and for a comprehensive investigation into the serious allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces.  We continue to press for this through our own statements, in the context of our EU membership and through participation in UN fora. Ireland&rsquo;s position on this issue is reflected in Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 October, which furthermore announced the suspension of invitations to the EU by senior military officers from Myanmar, reaffirmation of the EU arms embargo, and that further measures would be considered if the situation does not improve. </p>  <p>  I had an opportunity to raise Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in my statement to the UN General Assembly on 23 September, and Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on this issues [which was adopted by the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on 14 November]. At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2017, Ireland also actively supported the extension of the mandate of the UN Fact Finding Mission which has been tasked with investigating allegations of human rights abuses by the Myanmar security forces.</p>  <p>  The ASEM Foreign Minister&rsquo;s Meeting will take in Nay Pyi Taw next week and will present an important opportunity for EU member states to engage with the Government of Myanmar on this issue. Ireland will be represented by Minister of State Ciar&aacute;n Cannon at this meeting, and I have asked him to convey the Government&rsquo;s concerns directly to representatives of the Government of Myanmar on my behalf. </p></reply>

I wish, first of all, to extend to all of those affected by recent acts of violence in Colombia my sincere sympathies and condolences.  Violence and intimidation against local communities in marginalised rural areas of Colombia, as well as the continued presence of armed groups in such communities, remain a matter of great concern.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that such violence is entirely unacceptable.  I am glad to have this opportunity to again urge the Government of Colombia to ensure that all such violent incidents are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to support peace and human rights in Colombia.  As well as exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials of my Department engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across Colombia.  We also provide funding directly to the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights in Colombia to support its work in promoting and protecting human rights including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions.  Officials from the Embassy in Mexico maintain regular contact with the OHCHR in Colombia and receive updates from that office on the violence affecting communities.  </p>  <p>  Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation, including the full decommissioning of FARC weapons by July 2017, eight months after the agreement was finalised.  A ceasefire with the country&rsquo;s second largest guerrilla group, the ELN, took effect at the beginning of October.  However, as we know from our own experience, peace is the work of decades.  Ireland is committed to supporting the full implementation of the agreement to ensure a future of peace for all Colombians.</p></reply>

Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided by the EU and its Member States reached &euro;75.5 billion in 2016, an 11% increase compared to 2015 levels and bringing it to the highest level to date. This increase took place in a context of worsening man-made and natural disasters, an unprecedented migration crisis in Europe, and a global refugee crisis of historic proportions, with the number of refugees and displaced people reaching 65 million world-wide - the largest number since World War II. These factors led to an increase in EU aid in order to respond to humanitarian disasters, to support refugees and to help developing countries to overcome poverty and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).In 2016, ODA provided through EU institutions, managed by the European Commission, amounted to US$ 15.7 billion, an increase of 14.3% over 2015. More than half of this was programmed with partner countries. Bilateral ODA from the European Commission focused primarily on Eastern Europe (30%) and Sub Saharan Africa (27%), with the Middle East and North Africa being allocated 15%, South and Central Asia 8%, Latin America and the Caribbean 7%, and other countries in Asia and Oceania 3%.</p><p>Ireland believes that this development assistance is delivering strong results. For example, because of assistance provided to developing countries by the EU Commission in 2015, over 400,000 people benefitted from programmes to support post-conflict peace building; 5 million women and children under 5 benefitted from nutrition-related programmes, helping to reduce child mortality; 2,600 KM of electricity transmission/distribution lines were built or upgraded; 10.6 million children were enrolled in primary education and 7.6 million in secondary education; over 8 million births were attended by skilled health personnel, helping to reduce maternal mortality; 4 million hectares of protected areas were managed to ensure biological diversity and to preserve natural heritage, and; 10,000 firms gained access to credit to boost investment and avoid risk. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU development cooperation budget is assessed by the European Commission on an annual basis, and is calculated by attributing our percentage share of the overall EU budget as a Member State to the total EU expenditure on ODA. An increase in the size of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and thus our contribution to the EU generally therefore results in an increase in our assessed contributions. This in turn helps to fund the EU Development Cooperation Instrument, Humanitarian Aid, and the European Development Fund (EDF). In addition, Ireland also supports a number of specific EU Trust Funds, such as that on Africa.  </p><p>In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to EU-managed ODA amounted to &euro;182.26 million.Almost &euro;9.13 billion in ODA expenditure was allocated from the EU&rsquo;s general budget, of which Ireland&rsquo;s determined share was 1.613%, or &euro;147.25 million. This is a marked increase on the 2015 figures which show ODA eligible expenditure at &euro;7.41 billion and Ireland&rsquo;s share at 1.28%, or &euro;94.55 million. Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Development Fund in 2016 was &euro;32.76 million. Assessed contributions from Ireland to the EU will continue to rise in 2018, and though we do not know yet what the final figures will be we are expecting another increase. </p><p>EU development assistance is subject to various forms of rigorous monitoring and evaluation by a number of different and separate bodies: the European Court of Auditors; the EU&rsquo;s Results-Oriented Monitoring (ROM) system, an external, independent review system; the EU&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit; the European Parliament, and; contributing Member States, including Ireland.  </p><p>Ireland plays a full and active part in overseeing EU development assistance, and ensuring that there is effective oversight, accountability, and transparency. In addition, Ireland is a member of the European Development Fund Management Committee which manages this component.Reporting on this, and the other aspects of our official development assistance programme, Irish Aid, will continue to be done to the Oireachtas primarily through the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Public Accounts Committee. In addition, my officials are currently engaging with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade with regards to EU development financing. </p><p>In Europe, Ireland engages actively at the political and official levels in discussions with our EU partners and with the European Commission to ensure that our development policy priorities are reflected in EU programmes &ndash; including the targeting of aid to where it is needed most, and the tackling of problems at the root cause. Earlier this year Member States agreed a revised <i>EU Consensus on Development</i>which ensures that EU development policy is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and responding to new global challenges. </p><p>Discussions are currently underway between Member States on the successor arrangements to the Cotonou Agreement governing Europe&rsquo;s relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific states and Ireland is actively involved in these discussions &ndash; including through participation in the African Union and European Union Summit in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire later this month. We will continue to promote European core values of peace, security, sustainable development, poverty reduction, and human rights worldwide, with the aim of ensuring that no one is left behind.</p></reply>

The Government that came into power in 2011 had to first stabilise the public finances, bring the State to the position where we could exit the bailout, and then steer the economy into growth.  As the Deputy will be aware, in recent years, the country has had the fastest growing economy in the EU.  As a consequence of the recovery, the Government re-opened the Garda College at the first available opportunity and began an ambitious recruitment campaign.  </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  It will take time to address the impact of the moratorium on Garda recruitment imposed in 2010 but the active recruitment which began in 2014 will in due course have a positive impact on the number of Garda&iacute; in supervisory roles within the Force, including in the Cavan/Monaghan Division. I am advised by the Commissioner that competitions for promotion to the ranks of Sergeant and Inspector are currently in train and that the requirements of each Garda Division including the Cavan/ Monaghan Division will be considered by the Commissioner when assigning successful candidates from these competitions.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p>  <p>  The Garda Station referred to forms part of the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available the strength of the Cavan/Monaghan Division was 321, of whom 50 were Sergeants. I am further informed that the strength of the Garda Station in question on the 31 December 2007 was 40 of whom 6 were Sergeants and on 30 September 2017 it was 43 of whom 6 were Sergeants. There are also 12 Garda Reserves and 38 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The filling of vacancies in the supervisory ranks of Sergeant and Inspector is a matter for the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006 (as amended) for holding competitions for the selection of members for promotion to these ranks.</p></reply>

A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p>  <p>  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Cavan/Monaghan Division, in the coming years. </p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure over the period 2016 to 2021. </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides for an investment of &euro;46 million the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015. In the period 2013 to end of 2017 almost &euro;44 million will have been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream in that period. </p>  <p>  This investment in resources will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cavan/Monaghan Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.   </p></reply>

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time particularly with regard to establishing whether the statutory conditions for naturalisation as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, such as good character and lawful residence, are satisfied.</p>  <p>  In many cases delays can arise as further documentation may be required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the office.  In some instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example where information comes to light which requires further investigation.  In other instances the applicant may request that a hold be put on their application, for example where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.</p>  <p>  Records are not maintained which would facilitate the production of the detailed information requested by the Deputy.  The retrieval and compilation of the detailed information would necessitate a disproportionate use of time and resources which could not be justified in circumstances where the priority is to deal with the cases on hand.</p></reply>

The Government has allocated an additional &euro;646 million in current expenditure to Health in Budget 2018, including funds for an additional 1,800 front line staff. The overall Health budget for 2018 is almost &euro;15.3 billion. The HSE is currently finalising the 2018 Service Plan and will allocate the additional posts in accordance with service demands. </p><p>The HSE has been focused on increasing the number of frontline staff over the past three years as the budgetary position has improved and progress has been made in growing the consultant, NCHD and nursing workforce. While there are difficulties in filling posts in certain specialties, including psychiatry, the number of consultants employed in the public health system continues to increase year on year. At the end of September 2017 there were 2,951 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 126 more than the end September 2016 figure and an increase of 666 in the past decade. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly. At the end of September 2017 there were 6,286 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 311 compared with the end of September 2016 number and an increase of over 1,394 in the past decade.  </p><p>Recruitment of nurses and midwives is a key priority this year. Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of September 2017 stood at 36,170 whole time equivalents. The number of nursing posts has increased by 632 in the 12 months from end September 2016 and by over 2,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in the four years from end September 2013 to end September 2017. The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017. The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts. The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter, following registration.</p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident, including psychiatry. The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018. The outcome of its assessment will be subject to discussions between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health I fully support the HPV immunisation programme and its aim to increase uptake rates of this important vaccine.</p></reply>

This programme is delivered under the NTPF&rsquo;s Statutory Instrument (2004, S.I. No. 179) &ldquo;<i>to collect, collate and validate information in relation to persons waiting for hospital treatment and to put in place information systems for that purpose&rdquo;</i></p><p>The aim and overall objective of this programme is:</p><p>1. To audit that hospitals are returning complete, accurate, validated patient information for inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.</p><p>2. To audit that hospitals have implemented key internal management practices to manage demand, capacity and productivity ensuring equitable access to treatment for patients on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists. </p><p>The RTE Investigates programme in February highlighted the deeply moving personal stories of people waiting for treatment in public hospitals. Following the programme I was determined that the health service must learn  from those patients&rsquo; experiences. As a result, I asked the NTPF to examine waiting list practices in the hospitals highlighted in the programme. </p><p>The NTPF has now reported to me on its findings and last week I published the finding of the Special Audit. The NTPF&rsquo;s report has a number of actions to be implemented by the individual hospitals and across the public hospital system as a whole, to drive better performance in terms of how waiting lists are managed in our hospitals.</p><p>Arising from the audit, the HSE has taken immediate steps to put in place a plan at national level that will focus on driving system-wide implementation of performance and process improvement in waiting list management. As part of this plan, the HSE will assess, review and oversee implementation of performance and process improvement to address the Special Audit findings across all hospitals. </p><p>Addressing the Special Audit Report&rsquo;s recommendations will be a priority for the HSE for the remainder of the year and will form a core pillar of the Waiting List Action Plans for 2018 as well as the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan. In addition I have asked the NTPF to develop a plan to extend the Special Audit process in 2018 to other public acute hospitals.</p></reply>

It is expected that the funding provided will result in better access for patients, more help for families and more supports for disability, mental health and older and vulnerable people.  The exact quantum of services to be delivered in 2018 will be set out in detail in the 2018 National Service Plan currently being prepared by the Health Service Executive.</p><p>The additional funding provided will mean more front-line staff for the health service across the acute, mental health, disability, primary and community care sectors.  Increases in nursing numbers will be realised as we continue to extend and roll out the Task-force on Safe Staffing.</p><p>Some of the key areas where funding will be targeted and where it is hoped to have a positive impact on the delivery of services in the coming year are highlighted below.</p><p><b><i>New access programme</i></b></p><p>Reducing waiting times for patients and improving access to our health services is a key priority.  The significant increase in funding to the NTPF in 2018 should ensure that additional procedures will be offered to patients across a range of specialties and procedures.  This means that more patients will be seen in our hospitals and fewer patients should encounter long waiting times.  In addition, funding to improve access to emergency care in 2018 will enable the opening of additional hospital capacity, including new beds and by providing additional diagnostic services and surge capacity to reduce Emergency Department overcrowding.</p><p>Additional funding will also be available to progress key strategic initiatives which will enable progress in the phased implementation of the National Cancer Strategy, the National Maternity Strategy, and in the continued development of the National Ambulance Service.  Extra funding for home care packages and transitional care beds should also further strengthen supports for older people, particularly to facilitate speedier discharge from acute hospitals over the winter period.</p><p><b><i>Shift to Primary Care</i></b></p><p>The provision of a new primary care fund will enable a range of initiatives to be progressed in 2018 which will focus on disease prevention and early intervention, particularly through the further development and expansion of GP services, Community Intervention Teams and the recruitment of additional therapy posts and advanced nurse practitioners.  Throughout 2018 there will also be a continued focus on the development of primary care centres and primary care teams.</p><p><b><i>Expanding and developing Mental Health Services</i></b></p><p>The provision of an additional &euro;35 million for 2018 will help build on the work commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of Community Teams for Children, Adults, Later Life and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services.  It will also help continue the move towards a full 24/7 service with an initial focus on increasing the provision of services on a 7-day-a-week basis.  Further improvements are also planned to services for Eating Disorders and Dual Diagnosis.</p><p><b><i>Supporting Disability Services</i></b></p><p>Additional funding for Disability Services will be focused on a number of priority areas arising from ongoing demographic changes including residential places, respite places, Personal Assistance and Home Support service hours.</p><p><b><i>Supporting the most vulnerable</i></b></p><p>A focus on the health needs of the most vulnerable groups in society, who can experience health inequalities, have difficulties accessing services and present with multiple, complex health and support needs will also be maintained.  In this context, significant additional funding has been approved to address the health needs of people who are homeless and have mental health and addiction issues in line with Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>Additional funding has also been provided to the Healthy Ireland Fund which will support partnership working in different sectors and communities to help ensure policies under Healthy Ireland have an impact at local level and empower people to improve their own health and well-being.</p></reply>

At the end of September 2017 there were 6,286 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 311 compared with the end of September 2016 number and an increase of over 1,394 in the past decade. </p><p>Nursing and midwifery numbers at the end of September 2017 stood at 36,170 whole time equivalents. The number of nursing posts has increased by 632 in the 12 months from end September 2016 and by over 2,000<font color="#FF0000"> </font>in the four years from end September 2013 to end September 2017. The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017.  The recent quarterly progress report on the Agreement from the HSE (30th Sept 2017) states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts. It is important to bear in mind however that most student nurses graduate in the autumn. The HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end, given that most students who complete their training at the end of August are recruited in the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter, following registration.</p></reply>

A Steering Group is overseeing the project, with support from external consultants commissioned to provide technical, analytical and engagement expertise. An independent international peer review group is involved in ongoing review and validation of the methodology and approach.

The report makes a range of recommendations in relation to the hospital sector. I am committed to returning to Government by the end of the year with a detailed response to the report and a draft programme of reform.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am very aware of the interrelated nature of the challenges our health service faces. As a consequence, I have prioritised a range of policy and operational initiatives to address waiting lists, Emergency Department overcrowding, bed capacity and staff recruitment.</p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018. Budget 2018 allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;10m for the remainder of 2017 to fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures. In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the HSE has been implementing Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. </p>  <p>  Tackling overcrowding in Emergency Departments is a key commitment of this Government and I am happy to confirm that &euro;40 million in additional funding in 2017 has been made available as part of the 2018 Budget to address winter pressures and waiting lists over the rest of this year. A further &euro;45 million has been allocated for measures to improve access to unscheduled care and other acute hospital priorities in 2018. </p>  <p>  Some of this funding is already being utilised within the system, with an additional 45 homecare packages and 20 transitional care beds per week being provided for the duration of the winter period. This funding will allow for patients to return home, or an appropriate community setting, when clinically appropriate, thus helping to alleviate some of the pressures our hospitals are currently experiencing.  </p>  <p>  Funding will also be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and moving forward, as part of service planning for 2018. My Department is undertaking a Health Service Capacity review in line with the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the findings of which are due to be published before the end of the year, and which will provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  </p>  <p>  Further, my Department and the HSE are implementing a range of initiatives to increase the medical and nursing workforce.</p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm to the Deputy that all Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their locality focussed on planning and escalation preparedness, maintaining patient flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness. </p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018. Budget 2018 allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;10m for the remainder of 2017 to fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, the HSE has been implementing Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding. Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 29,000 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  </p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that to date 14,551 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Initiatives, 4,574 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,822 patients have received their procedure. The NTPF has also indicated that 3,716 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 1,415 offers of treatment have been accepted and 776 patients have been treated. </p>  <p>  Under the Oupatient Plan, since early February, almost 100,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2018, &euro;50m in funding will be allocated to the NTPF for patient treatment and a further &euro;10m to HSE to address waiting lists, including in the area of paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis.  The HSE and NTPF are working together to develop coherent and synergistic Waiting List Action Plans in 2018 for inpatient/daycase, outpatient and scoliosis, in order to continue the focus on long-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers.</p></reply>

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments. However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas. In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 Framework Agreement with industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds. Criteria which must be considered include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. </p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs. However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and in such cases this must be sought. Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought by the company, lengthy price negotiations between the HSE and the manufacturer may be needed. These factors contribute significantly to the length of the reimbursement decision making process.</p>  <p>  With the potential costs involved and the competing demands across the health service, every effort must be made to secure the best outcome for the health service and the taxpayer. This includes seeking realistic and sustainable pricing and supply models for new treatments.</p></reply>

However, the commission has made an offer to Mercosur which  includes a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) for beef.  The TRQ  offer is split evenly between fresh and frozen beef. A proportion of the fresh beef would be required to meet the definition of "High Quality Beef", and would therefore have to come from grass fed animals, and a proportion of the frozen beef would be for manufacturing only. </p>  <p>  I was deeply disappointed that the Commission decided to include beef in its offer during the last round of negotiations. I believe that this could not be coming at a worse time for the EU beef sector. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have been very active in highlighting the potentially very damaging impact of a Mercosur deal on the European agriculture sector, and on the beef sector in particular. We continue to monitor the situation closely and respond as appropriate to developments in order to defend the interests of Irish farmers, working in close co-operation with my Government colleagues, particularly the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  At political level, I have continuously raised the issue with my Member State colleagues and with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstr&ouml;m, both within the Council of Agriculture Ministers and in written form. These efforts have been reinforced at official level through similar contacts with Member States and the Commission, particularly through the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Trade Policy Committee. The Taoiseach has also raised the matter with Presidents Juncker and Macron.</p>  <p>  Most recently, Ireland made the latest in a series of very strong interventions on this matter at the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels on 27 October, and I raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg in October and again in Brussels on 6 November. I have also worked very closely with a number of other Member States, most notably France, including in the production of a joint paper that was submitted to the European Commission on 26 September outlining our shared concerns. And I wrote to Commissioner Malmstroem in early October reiterating my concerns in relation to the tabling of a beef TRQ offer.   </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. In this regard I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.  </p></reply>

However, I am advised that no definitive decision has been made by An Post regarding post office closures. I have not received a list of potential post office closures.   An Post has carried out a fundamental review of the company to identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to put the company on a sound financial footing. In this context, An Post has looked at the future of the post office network with a view to ensuring a sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates. Any changes in this area will have to be the subject of negotiation between An Post and the Postmasters. I continue to encourage An Post to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network. It is expected that Government will be briefed shortly on the strategic review. Until such time it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p></reply>

These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and rollout of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website. </p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience. AIM is a child-centred and evidence-based model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting. </p><p>Where a pre-school provider, in conjunction with a parent, considers that some additional support is needed in order to meet the needs of a child with a disability in an inclusive way, an application can be made for a suite of targeted supports, namely:</p><p><i>Level 4: Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support</i></p><p>This level provides access to mentoring for early years practitioners from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete an online Access and Inclusion Profile. This looks at the strengths, abilities and needs of the child, as well as the strengths and needs of the pre-school setting.  </p><p><i>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grants</i></p><p>This level provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early years settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. A short report from a designated professional is required confirming that the specialised equipment or minor building alterations are necessary.</p><p><i>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention</i></p><p>This level provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child to be enrolled and to fully participate in the ECCE Programme. To avail of this support, pre-school providers and parents are requested to complete the online Access and Inclusion Profile. The Early Years Specialist will review the profile and, where therapeutic input is likely to be required; the Specialist will initiate contact with the HSE. The HSE decides on the appropriate level of therapeutic intervention.</p><p><i>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room</i></p><p>This level provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. It is estimated that pre-school providers may need Level 7 in the case of approximately 1% to 1.5% of all children. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p><p>AIM was launched in June 2016. The total funding allocated and outturn in 2016 and 2017 to levels 4, 5 and 7 of AIM by my Department is set out below. Funding for AIM Level 6 comes from the Department of Health Vote.</p><p>The Inter-Department Group, which developed AIM recognised that it would take approximately three years to fully develop and implement the Model. It is expected that demand for all levels of support under AIM will increase in years 2 and 3 and the budget available for AIM makes provision for this. </p><p><table><tr><th>Level </th><th>Element of

The funding is provided to cover the costs associated with running the CE scheme, such as wages for the supervisor and participants and other direct costs such as insurance, materials, and training costs. </p>  <p>  At the end of each annual contract, the sponsor must have a record of all financial transactions of the project presented in a coherent manner.  These records must be supported by the submission of an independent, professionally certified, audited Statement of Income and Expenditure. </p>  <p>  The requirement under the CE Procedures for an annual audit of projects reflects the fact that funding for CE comes from the Exchequer, therefore it is important to maintain control of the finances, and the Department is answerable to the Government, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee for the administration of this funding.  </p>  <p>  There is a separate legal requirement under the Companies Acts for an annual audit of the registered company, as the organisation running a CE project may have other business interests or activities outside of the CE funding.  In the majority of cases the work carried out for the CE audit can be used to assist with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) audit.</p>  <p>  My Department seeks to maximise the value for money to be achieved from the CE programme, while maintaining transparency and good public financial governance, and in that context the current audit requirements will be reviewed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Typically, these workers provide services in rural and less densely populated areas but larger urban centres may also have a cohort of part-time workers. </p>  <p>  I note the information the Deputy has supplied in relation to a particular individual and the difficulty that person has had in finding full time employment. </p>  <p>  Retained fire-fighters who are otherwise unemployed are entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training, subject to the usual qualification conditions in relation to means or social insurance contributions.  They are, also required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of being available for and genuinely seeking full time work.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the unusual circumstances of retained fire personnel the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 carried amendments to both jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance that put the treatment of retained fire fighters on a legislative basis. These amendments were introduced with particular regard to the vital service provided by this group, particularly in rural communities where the fire service is almost exclusively staffed by retained personnel. </p>  <p>  This legislation provided that when a retained fire fighter is on call this will not result in a disallowance for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment on grounds of availability.  It also provides that retained fire fighters are exempt from suffering a loss of a day of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for any day of firefighting employment.  Finally, the legislation also provides an exemption for retained fire fighters from having to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition under jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  The legislation and associated regulations outlined above allow retained fire-fighters a reasonable and fair level of access to the jobseeker schemes given the unique circumstances of the service they provide their communities.</p></reply>

No additional information, e.g., any of the Public Service Identity data held by my Department, is issued with any text sent as part of a MyGovID verification process. </p>  <p>  Point (a) of my previous response related to the process for verification of an individual&rsquo;s mobile phone.  Currently, a person&rsquo;s mobile phone number is verified in a Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection office.  The person must attend themselves and have their mobile phone with them.  The process takes place in the presence of an officer of the Department and involves an SMS incorporating a code being sent by the system to the mobile phone number provided by the person.  That code is then entered confidentially onto a keypad by the person.  Assuming the code inputted in the keypad matches that sent to the mobile phone number supplied, that mobile phone number is then considered verified and may be used as part of the verification of the person&rsquo;s MyGovID account. </p>  <p>  It is the mobile phone number that is being verified, not the handset or device. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes undertaking overseas Peace Support Operations, and in this regard to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on all missions. </p><p>The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement directives, including the Directive on the procurement of Defensive and Security Equipment. Details of tender competitions can be accessed on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website <i>www.etenders.gov.ie . </i></p><p>Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions. In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.</p><p>The matter of barring companies or countries from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit. </p><p>Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. </p><p>The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargoes. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect. </p><p>As I outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question Number 62 of 17 May 2017 regarding the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) currently operated by the Defence Forces, 4 UAV Systems were procured between 2007 and 2009 from Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd based in Israel following a competitive tender process. An upgrade of the Defence Forces UAV systems was carried out by Aeronautic Defense Systems as the original equipment manufacturer in 2016. This involved the upgrade of 4 UAV systems, with 3 airframes in each system. A number of additional simulators and pneumatic launchers have also been procured.</p><p>Details of the contracts awarded to Israeli companies for defensive equipment and services over the past ten years, including the UAV systems, are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Goods/Services ordered from Israeli Companies from 2007 to 2017</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Item </th><th>Company </th><th>Value (ex vat) &euro; </th></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems and Spares </td><td>Aeronautics Defence Systems </td><td>930,965.88 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>Surveillance &amp;amp; Target Acquisition Equipment </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>1,966,350.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>Equipment Software Updates </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>444,950.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems </td><td>Aeronautics Defence Systems </td><td>1,444,461.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>Maintenance Agreement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems </td><td>Aeronautics Defence Systems </td><td>610,140.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>Maintenance Agreement for Fire Control Computer System </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>180,000.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>Helmets </td><td>Rabintex </td><td>26,678.70 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>Cables </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>4,500.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 -2015 </td><td>Batteries for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems </td><td>Aeronautics Defence System </td><td>45,498.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 to date </td><td>Maintenance Agreement (Surveillance &amp;amp; Target Acquisition Fire Control Computer System) </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>710,000.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2013-2015 </td><td>Ground Surveillance Radars </td><td>Elbit Systems </td><td>2,314,166.00 </td></tr><tr><td>2016-2017 </td><td>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System - Upgrade </td><td>Aeronautics Defence Systems </td><td>2,406,760.00 </td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td></td><td>TOTAL </td><td>&euro;11,084,468.70 </td></tr></table></p></reply>
