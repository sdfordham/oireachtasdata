In May 2012, the Government approved the establishment of a Civil Service HR and Pensions Shared Services Centre, PeoplePoint, which has been operational since March this year.  It already serves some 15,000 employees across 13 organisations.  Once PeoplePoint becomes fully operational, at the end of 2014, serving 40 organisations, savings estimated at &euro;12.5 million annually will be achieved in the delivery transactional services for Human Resources. </p><p>  In April, the Government also approved the establishment of a Civil Service Payroll Shared Services Centre which will commence operations next month.  It is important to note that international experience has demonstrated that no Shared Service Centre can deliver savings until it is fully established and stabilised.  This typically takes two to three years and the payback period is usually four to six years in a public service context.  </p><p>  With effect from January 2013, funding for these new Shared Service arrangements is provided under the Shared Services Vote for which my Department is responsible.  This dedicated Vote provides transparency on expenditure and funding of Shared Services Centres as they become operational.  </p><p>  The total estimated set up or project costs relating to both PeoplePoint and Payroll Shared Services for 2013 is &euro;10,438,000.  The total set up costs for 2014 is &euro;10,075,000.  In 2015, when PeoplePoint is fully operational, there will be no further set up costs.  It is not possible to comment on 2015 set up costs for Payroll Shared Services at this time.  Once fully operational, Payroll Shared Services will result in &euro;5.6 million savings annually in addition to the &euro;12.5 million annual savings associated with PeoplePoint.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-21a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112100063#WRA00800"><p>Under a public contract the contractual relationship is between the public body and the main contractor.  A public body has no contractual ties with a subcontractor engaged by a main contractor.  Any contractual relationship is exclusively a matter between the main contractor and its subcontractor.  </p><p>  I am keenly aware of the difficulties being experienced by subcontractors in this current economic climate.  In this regard, my colleague, Minister of State Brian Hayes TD worked with Senator Fergal Quinn earlier this year on the development of the Construction Contracts Bill which was enacted on 29 July 2013 (Construction Contracts Act No 34. 2013).</p><p>  The Act seeks to address the issue of non-payment to construction contractors who have completed work on construction contracts by setting minimum standards for the payment provisions in construction contracts (whether the contracts are written or otherwise).  In addition, if a payment dispute arises, then the Act also provides for a swift and cost effective adjudication process.  This will provide a route for subcontractors to achieve redress in the event that non-payment occurs. </p><p>  The general issue of policy relating to prompt payments between businesses is a matter for my colleague Mr, Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The rules governing prompt payment have been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).  This legislation acts as a deterrent to late payment by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms.  It lays down specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to public or private transactions.</p><p>  The enforcement of contractual rights, including any rights and obligations provided for by the Regulations, is a matter for individual suppliers.  If the purchaser refuses to pay prompt/late payment interest and compensation to the supplier, then the supplier can seek their own legal advice on the matter.  The supplier can also decide not to pursue prompt/late payment and compensation from a purchaser if he/she so wishes but is legally entitled to claim where such payment would apply.  I am informed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that the Regulations do not provide for any enforcement role for that Department in respect of these matters.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains commitments in respect of a Code of Conduct on Prompt Payments to improve cash flow for business and to take steps to enhance awareness of the need for prompt payments by all elements of business.  This Code which is currently being finalised by the various business representative bodies with the support of  the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is aimed at improving cash flow between businesses and also helping address the culture of late payments in Ireland.</p><p>  In addition my colleague, Mr John Perry, TD, Minister for Small Business recently announced a national Late Payment Information Campaign, which will start on the 9th December in Dublin before being rolled out to other parts of the country early in the New Year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-21a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112100063#WRA01000"><p>The core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management Study.  The CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the Office of Public Works and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin, including the Callows area, subject to meeting environmental and economic cost-benefit criteria.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early Summer flooding in the Callows, the OPW facilitated discussions between these principal operating stakeholders toward agreeing a new interim control regime on the regulation of levels.  Under this interim regime the ESB has agreed to a trial lowering of the Spring/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding particularly in the Shannon Callows area.  This trial commenced this summer and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM Plan.</p><p>  On foot of discussions between my colleague, Minister of State Tom Hayes and the IFA, and with the co-operation of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, a water level monitoring exercise is being carried out as part of the CFRAM process which will allow for analysis of water flows and levels at key points around the Lough Ree and Callows areas.  Data from this exercise is being collated currently and the results will feed into the overall Shannon CFRAM study.</p><p>  The OPW will continue to review these developments on a regular basis in consultation with the ESB and Waterways Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-21a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112100063#WRA01200"><p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) maintains a modern Visitor Centre at Glendalough staffed by Guides on a year round basis displaying an interesting exhibition and an audiovisual show about the history of the site.  In addition, the OPW provides a guide presence to further enhance the visitor experience and English, French, Italian, Spanish &amp;amp; German guided tours are available throughout the year.  Many commercial tour operators operate day tours to the site and it is a popular destination close to Dublin for international short stay visitors, which remains open all year round.  </p><p>  Visitors may freely access the Glendalough site and scenic walks around the lakes without entering through the Visitor Centre and many clearly choose to do this.  The OPW is not in a position to capture data on this traffic but it is certainly significant.  Visitor numbers recorded at the OPW Visitor Centre in 2012 were 79,983; the equivalent number recorded to end September 2013 is 72,033.  It is clear that many multiples of this figure visit the site without visiting the Centre.</p><p>  It is evident, given the volume of traffic to Glendalough, that visitors will continue to be attracted in large numbers to this location and the primary focus and challenge to OPW will be to continue to preserve and protect the Monument and present it to the public in a way that ensures that the fabric of the site is not damaged.  The facilities currently available to OPW to fulfil this mandate are adequate for the purpose and there are no immediate plans to develop any further tourist facilities.  However, given the large volume of visitors a number of management issues have arisen in recent years in the vicinity which make it imperative to manage the traffic to the Glendalough site more efficiently.  In this regard, the OPW has engaged with local stakeholders, including Wicklow Co. Council, to focus on issues such as carparking, traffic management and visitor security so as to ensure that the many people who wish to visit Glendalough can continue to do so safely and enjoyably.  OPW will also continue to engage with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ensure that Glendalough is marketed appropriately internationally as a visitor destination and that awareness of the site and its attractions for visitors are presented favourably wherever possible.  High profile visits such as that undertaken by the First Lady of the US and her children, help considerably to raise the profile of the site.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-21a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112100063#WRA01400"><p>I am keenly aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  I am also aware of the need for Departments and Offices to make every effort to contain and reduce all administrative costs to ensure the continued provision of much needed public services.  In this regard, the National Procurement Service which will soon form part of the recently established Office of Government Procurement is engaged in an ambitious reform programme designed to deliver cost reductions for commonly acquired goods and services; increased levels of professionalism among staff responsible for procurement; and better performance management of the central procurement function.</p><p>  In relation to the framework for the supply of stationery and office supplies, referred to by the Deputy, I am informed by the National Procurement Service that they published a request for tenders for these supplies on eTenders on 9th August 2013.  The tender documentation seeks to encourage participation on a fair and equal basis by Small and Medium Enterprises (&ldquo;SME&rdquo;s) in this competition.  SMEs that believe the scope of this competition is beyond their technical or business capacity are encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Through such relationships they can participate and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements that result from this competition and therefore increase their social and economic benefits.  Similarly, larger enterprises are also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs can be included in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts that result from this tendering exercise.</p><p>  In a significant change to the previous single supplier contract, this competition has been structured as a multi-supplier framework agreement.  In this case the framework will be broken up into four sectoral groupings (lots) that will be subject to ongoing competition from the participants under the terms of the competition.  Furthermore in drafting the tender documentation, consideration was given to resolving issues that SMEs and Consortia might have adhering to standard requirements.  In order to address such issues the tender documentation included tables and instructions on how a consortium should complete them to address such issues.   </p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend.  We are also committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

This investment will be used to progress a number of additional projects and programmes in 2014 including the project to which the Deputy refers.  The precise allocation of the proceeds to the Departments concerned is being determined at present and will be published in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2014 in December.  My Department will not have any involvement in the management and/or roll-out of this or any of the other projects to be funded from the Lottery Licence transaction.  That will be a matter for the relevant Minister and his/her Department.  Of course, Departments must ensure that, as with all capital projects, those to be funded through this additional investment are appraised in line with the processes set out in the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

International best practice recommends that such a provision should be included in whistleblowing legislation as it provides an important protection for workers.  </p><p>  An employee who claims to have been dismissed for having made a protected disclosure may apply to the Circuit Court for interim relief pending a full hearing of the unfair dismissal claim.  If the Court finds it likely that there are substantial grounds for contending that the dismissal resulted wholly or partly from the making of a protected disclosure it will ask the employer to reinstate or re-engage the employee pending the full hearing of the Unfair Dismissals claim. </p><p>  If this is acceptable, the Court will make an order for reinstatement or re-engagement on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate.  However if it is not acceptable the Court will make an order for the continuation of the employee&rsquo;s contract of employment on the terms and conditions it decides.  If circumstances subsequently change, either party may apply to the Court for the revocation of the order on the ground of a relevant change of circumstances.  If an employer does not comply with the Court order, compensation may be paid to the employee.	</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-21a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112100063#WRA02200"><p>As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have overarching responsibility for the public service and I am confident that the public service stands as a leading employer in respect of human resource policies and practices aimed at increasing the participation of women at all levels.  While each individual sector has responsibility for the specific arrangements relating to gender equality, my own Department is responsible for gender equality policy in the Civil Service. </p><p>  In that context, as can be seen from the table below, significant progress has been made in addressing gaps between male and female participation at different grade levels in the civil service workforce.  For example, as set out in the table, the proportion of women in middle and senior management grades in the civil service, in which even up to fifteen years ago, a relatively low percentage of posts were filled by women, is a strong demonstration of the impact of a number of initiatives which have been implemented to achieve better gender balance.  Indeed the targets included in the National Women&rsquo;s Strategy 2007-2016 for the percentage of women in the grades of AP and PO in the Civil Service has already been well exceeded for both grades. </p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note increases in the representation of women in grades that are feeder groups for middle and senior management grades as an important indicator of further increases over time in the number of women in senior positions in the civil service.  Research had previously identified under-representation of women, in particular, in the Assistant Principal grade as a particular obstacle to the advancement of women to more senior levels.</p><p>  While there are many factors, both societal and organisation specific, which have contributed to the increase in female participation at higher grades in the Civil Service, a number of specific initiatives have been particularly relevant in a civil service context including:</p><p>- The introduction of targets in 2000 aiming to fill <font color="#2F2F2F">one-third of Assistant Principal posts by women.</font></p><p>- The Gender Equality Policy in the Civil Service which was launched in 2001 which <font color="#2F2F2F">highlighted the need to introduce a modern approach to equality in human resource areas such as recruitment, promotion and training and suggested a number of practical steps which can be taken by Departments to promote equality of opportunity in these areas.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- The </font>extensive range of flexible working arrangements available to all civil servants which allows them to balance their work and personal commitments. </p><p>  The recent Haddington Road Agreement included some amendments to flexitime and worksharing arrangements.  Work-life balance arrangements in the civil service are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  Civil servants continue to have access to a number of flexible working arrangements, including flexi-time, work-sharing arrangements, the shorter working year scheme and career breaks.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress which has been made in increasing the participation of women in the work force, there is clearly a continuing need to promote strategies that continue to increase female participation at senior levels across all sectors of the public service.  In this regard, it is expected that the Report of the Sub-Committee on Women in Decision-Making &lsquo;<i>Towards Gender Parity in Decision-Making in Ireland</i>  &rsquo; chaired by the Minister for State with responsibility for Equality will be submitted to Government shortly.  Officials from my Department will, of course, review the relevant findings of that Report, in order to continue to support increased participation of women at all levels in the civil service. </p><p><b>Female civil servants according to grade 1997-2013</b><table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>1997</th><th>2007</th><th>2010</th><th>2013</th><th>Increases since 1997</th></tr><tr><td>Secretary General</td><td>5%</td><td>19%</td><td>17.6%</td><td>26%</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy &amp;amp; Assistant Secretary</td><td>10%</td><td>19%</td><td>16.1%</td><td>24%</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>Principal Officer</td><td>12%</td><td>26%</td><td>30.6%</td><td>34%</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal</td><td>24%</td><td>33%</td><td>38.6%</td><td>42%</td><td>18%</td></tr><tr><td>Administrative Officer</td><td>37%</td><td>40%</td><td>59.2%</td><td>45%</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer</td><td>39%</td><td>46%</td><td>51.8%</td><td>54%</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Executive Officer</td><td>54%</td><td>56%</td><td>66.7%</td><td>59%</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Staff Officer</td><td></td><td>76%</td><td>79.2%</td><td>77%</td><td>1% (since 2007)</td></tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer</td><td></td><td>75%</td><td>77.4%</td><td>75%</td><td>(No changes since 2007)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In terms of cost reduction, &euro;300 million of savings were incorporated into the various votes in the Revised Estimates Volume 2013, which represents a real and tangible reduction in expenditure.  In relation to 2014 and future years, the savings to be generated from the Agreement will be incorporated into the estimates for all votes as part of the estimates process.</p><p>  While these monetary targets are of critical importance, it is also important to remember some of the other key benefits which this Agreement brings.  It provides us with the scope to progress the reform agenda and to deliver unprecedented increases in productivity across the Public Service.  The benefits from the additional hours under the Agreement are significant, with measures around increased productivity set to deliver approximately &euro;430 million of the &euro;1 billion targeted savings.</p><p>  In relation to the Croke Park Agreement, the final report of the Implementation Body concluded that it facilitated significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime, comprising of almost &euro;1 billion in pay savings and over &euro;800 million in non-pay efficiency savings.  The Agreement also ensured the delivery of central reforms while acting as a facilitator for a large number of reforms at sectoral level, across all sectors of the Public Service, in a climate of industrial peace.  The report also concluded that the overwhelming majority of commitments around cost extraction, reform and changed work practices had been substantially delivered.</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that an updated Public Service Reform Plan covering the period 2014 to 2016 is currently being developed and the Haddington Road Agreement will act as a key enabler for the delivery of this Reform Plan.</p></reply>

While the Deputy may not be referring to the right of appeal in relation to tax liabilities, which is a separate matter, in summary these provisions afford taxpayers the opportunity to ensure that they have been correctly assessed to tax and that they have been correctly granted any reliefs claimed by them that may be due.  These rights of appeal are comparable to taxpayers' rights of appeal in most developed countries.  Once a taxpayer&rsquo;s liability to tax has been determined in accordance with the law, it is a matter for the taxpayer to ensure that that liability is paid as and when due.  There are no further rights of appeal against paying taxes correctly due in accordance with the law.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; primary goal is to maximise compliance with Tax and Customs legislation.  Notwithstanding the current difficult financial, economic and business environment, Revenue is and will remain focused on securing the taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.  Revenue expects taxpayers to have a clear focus on maintaining payment compliance and on meeting their obligations in full on a timely basis.  Remedying late or non-compliance is preferably achieved through engagement with the taxpayer, but where that engagement is not forthcoming then Revenue will utilise appropriate collection enforcement measures, including referral to Sheriffs, to pursue outstanding tax debts.  Revenue&rsquo;s procedures in relation to collection and enforcement are set out in their Collection Manuals for Revenue staff (these are also available on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>) and implementation of these procedures are subject to appropriate supervision by officers at various levels to ensure that, before any enforcement action is taken, those procedures have been followed and have been applied appropriately according to the circumstances of any particular case.  It is important to note that all taxpayers who have failed to pay their taxes on time are given adequate opportunities to come to an arrangement with Revenue to pay their taxes over a period, where they face genuine difficulties in paying them in a single amount as due.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the execution of Revenue warrants by Sheriffs in respect of tax debts is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended.  However Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act 1945, and are independent of the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  They may seize whatever goods are necessary to satisfy an outstanding debt.</p><p>  Sheriffs are answerable before the Courts for any breach of the civil debt collection code and accordingly are not directly accountable to me or to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the execution of warrants for the collection of tax.  In these circumstances, I am not in a position to comment further on the processes used by sheriffs, training of their staff or legal actions if any taken in relation to the actions of sheriffs.</p><p>  As regards further oversight, in addition to being officers of the Court, the Sheriffs are subject to the Data Protection Acts.  I am further advised that the Sheriffs have in place a Code of Practice, available from any sheriff or on Revenue&rsquo;s website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers.  For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized a written inventory will be supplied to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.  The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.</p><p>  I have no plans to propose changes in relation to the provision of the Finance Acts governing tax debt collection and enforcement available to Revenue, as I am satisfied that these are appropriate to the safeguarding of the collection of taxes on behalf of the Exchequer.  I am also satisfied that the procedures Revenue have in place with regard to the use of the legislation are appropriate and strike the right balance in terms of fairness as between the majority of taxpayers who pay their taxes on a timely basis and those who fail to do so.  However, in the Finance Bill which is currently before the House I am proposing to provide for the forfeiture of alcohol products on unlicensed premises where a tax clearance certificate is not in place.</p><p>  While detailed information is not available to them, the Revenue Commissioners advise me that the OECD has reported that in a survey of 52 revenue bodies, practically all have available to them powers to arrange the seizure of taxpayers assets to enforce tax debt collection.</p></reply>

General practitioners act as an access and control point for the scheme of tax relief on health expenses, as all such expenses must be incurred on the advice or referral of a general practitioner.  If physiotherapy was allowed without the need for the treatment to be prescribed by a practitioner, it would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which could greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.  Given the difficult fiscal environment, I am not predisposed to such a potential cost increase.</p></reply>

For 2014, a further decline in the unemployment rate is expected, with an average rate of 12.4 per cent forecast.  After a number of very difficult years, a recovery in the labour market is now clearly taking hold. During this year live register data show a continually falling unemployment rate, which reached 13.2 per cent in October.</p><p>  The fall in the unemployment rate is being supported by strong employment growth. Data from the quarterly national household survey show that annual employment growth averaged 1.5 per cent in the first half of the year. Encouragingly, this reflected an increase in both full-time and part-time employment and was broad-based across the majority of sectors in the economy. Available indicators point to continued employment growth in the period since the second quarter, so that employment growth of 1.6 per cent is projected for this year as whole. Given the assumed path for domestic demand &ndash; which is more jobs-rich than externally-driven growth &ndash; employment growth of 1.5 per cent is forecast for next year.</p><p>  While we are now moving in the right direction, I want to reiterate that the Government is fully conscious of the scale of the unemployment difficulties facing us and several initiatives have been introduced in this respect. So while we are making progress, I am fully aware that there is some way to go.</p></reply>

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. </p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold &ndash; known as the &ldquo;Group threshold&rdquo; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>  Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000 &ndash; </b>  applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>  Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 &ndash; </b>  applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p><p><b>  Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 &ndash;</b>   applies in all other cases.</p><p>  Each child is therefore separately entitled to receive life-time gifts or inheritances up to the value of &euro;225,000 from his or her parents before any liability to CAT would arise.</p><p>  In addition to the life-time tax free Group A threshold below which a child is not liable for gift or inheritance tax, there is an exemption from CAT that is separately available for certain dwelling houses under section 86 Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003. The purpose of this exemption is to benefit individuals who have been living in a house for a period prior to taking the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling house must have resided in the house for a minimum of 3 years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling house. In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of 6 years commencing on the date of the gift or inheritance.</p><p>  This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift or inheritance tax when it is transferred.</p><p>  The dwelling house exemption is available to any beneficiary who meets the conditions for the exemption, irrespective of whether or not they are related to the disponer.</p><p>  Gifts or inheritances that qualify for the dwelling house exemption do not erode a person&rsquo;s tax free threshold.</p><p>  For example, a child who qualifies for the dwelling house exemption in respect of a gift or an inheritance taken by him or her of that dwelling house also still fully retains his or her Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000 which can separately be applied against the value of other assets received by way of gift or inheritance from his or her parents. </p><p>  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. </p><p>  There were no changes to CAT in the recent Budget.</p></reply>

As I informed the House previously in my replies to Questions Nos. [49518/13] and [49556/13] on 19 November 2013, where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  I also noted that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available on the Revenue website at <i></i> .</p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect that the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  </p><p>  An individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.</p><p>  In reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question as to whether the original owner can claim an exemption from the 2014 LPT charge, the legislation does not provide for an exemption for any vendor who was the liable person for the property on 1 November 2013 (and therefore liable to pay the tax for 2014) but who subsequently sells the property by the end of 2013. </p></reply>

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all moneys within it are fungible.  The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances available to the Exchequer at all times. This also helps to provide investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the maturity of debt.   For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external and internal shocks.  In general terms the overall level of cash reserves maintained depends on the amount of liabilities falling due for payment in the short term and the State&rsquo;s risk appetite in relation to such shocks over the longer term. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure.</p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages the national debt in order to ensure liquidity for the Exchequer. Decisions regarding the appropriate level of cash and related assets to be maintained take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. </p><p>  As Ireland returns to funding itself through the debt markets while still running a large though declining budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU/IMF programme is paramount. The NTMA plans accordingly to have cash on hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014 and the early part of 2015.  The State earns a return on its cash balances and related assets which the NTMA manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.</p><p>  Due to the fungibility of the various cash streams flowing into the Exchequer, it is not possible to provide a precise measure of the total cost of maintaining the cash balances in 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013.  However,  the NTMA has estimated that the difference between the average rate of interest payable on long-term borrowing and the average rate receivable on cash and related assets was in the range 2.4 to 3.1 percentage points in 2011-2012 and 2.7 percentage points in 2013 to date. The inputs to the cost of long-term borrowing include EU/IMF programme funds and the bond issuance done by the NTMA during 2012 and 2013</p><p>  The NTMA continues to keep the quantum, maturity and timing of market funding under review based on its assessment of what is required to regain full market access and the overall level of cash balances that it is prudent to maintain. It is the intention to run lower cash balances in the coming years and this has been reflected in the Budget 2014 projections.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council <font color="#2F2F2F">was established on an interim basis in July 2011 and on a statutory basis in December 2012 under the Fiscal Responsibility </font>Act 2012. The Act was subsequently amended by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013 to assign it the further function of endorsing the macro-economic forecasts as set out below<font color="#000080">, </font>  along with the Council&rsquo;s other functions. These are;</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- To endorse, as it considers appropriate, the macro-economic forecasts prepared by the Department of Finance on which the Budget and Stability Programme Update are based.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- To assess the official forecasts produced by the Department of Finance. </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- To assess whether the fiscal stance of the Government is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management, with reference to the EU Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- To monitor and assess compliance with the budgetary rule as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The budgetary rule requires that the Government&rsquo;s budget is in surplus or in balance, or is moving at a satisfactory pace towards that position.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">- In relation to the budgetary rule, to assess whether any non-compliance is a result of &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo;. This could mean a severe economic downturn and/or an unusual event outside the control of Government which may have a major impact on the budgetary position.</font></p><p>  The Fiscal Council&rsquo;s most recent Fiscal Assessment Report published in April 2013, is the only assessment report published since December 2012. In this report the Fiscal Council assessed the fiscal stance as appropriate. In addition, the Fiscal Council set out its views in relation to a wide range of macro-economic and fiscal matters. The key points of relevance to the question are set out below:</p><p>  - In chapter 2 on the assessment of Budgetary Forecasts the Council state: </p><p>  &quot;While the budgetary outlook has improved, significant macro-economic and public finance risks remain. The Budget 2013 projections assume the delivery of sizable expenditure savings. Achieving these savings, notably in the health sector, will be a key challenge.&quot; </p><p>  The position is that the delivery of the required expenditure consolidation in 2013 is a priority for all Ministers and their Departments. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is working with all Departments and Offices to monitor voted expenditure. At the end of October 2013, net voted expenditure was &euro;844 million behind profile. This highlights that in aggregate expenditure is being managed well within the targets for the year.</p><p>  - In Chapter 3 on the assessment of Compliance with Fiscal Rules, the Council commented: </p><p>  &quot;The structural budget balance plays a key part in the domestic and EU fiscal rules. However, this poses serious measurement challenges. These need to be addressed both at EU level and by the development of a more comprehensive domestic analysis.&quot; </p><p>  My Department has stated previously that measuring and projecting the structural balance for a small open economy such as Ireland is challenging because it involves unobservable items such as the output gap, the future path of potential GDP and adjusting the deficit for the impact of economic cycle. Structural balance estimates, by their nature, are subject to revision. At EU level, the Commission is investigating alternate model-specifications to improve estimates of the output gap, particularly around turning points in the economic cycle. My Department is working on improving the empirical rigour of its output gap modelling.</p><p>  - In chapter 4 on the assessment of the Fiscal Stance, the council stated the following: </p><p>  &quot;The suggested margin of safety has therefore been broadly achieved under the Government&rsquo;s current plans and so the Council is no longer making the case for &euro;1.9 billion in additional adjustments in this assessment. However, the Council&rsquo;s assessment is that the planned adjustments of &euro;3.1 billion in 2014 and &euro;2.0 billion in 2015 should not be reduced.&quot;</p><p>  The call for an additional &euro;1.9 billion had been made in the September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report. Government considered the proposal taking account of the potential impact additional consolidation could have on economic activity. Given the need to protect the emerging economic recovery, it was decided to stick to the previously announced consolidation strategy. In the intervening period, significant changes occurred, including the restructuring of the promissory note. In relation to Budget 2014, the Government did introduce a budgetary adjustment of &euro;3.1 billion including tax increases and expenditure cuts worth &euro;2.5 billion. Government decided to do this to help ensure a continued return to economic growth while also ensuring that fiscal sustainability was demonstrated by targeting a fiscal deficit below the required limit coupled with a small primary balance.</p><p>  - The Council also stated that: </p><p>  &quot;Budget-impacting developments will have to be monitored closely, with particular attention paid to any shortfalls in growth and the effective implementation of expenditure-reduction plans.&quot; </p><p>  It should be noted that budgetary outturns for both revenue and expenditure are closely monitored by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Outturns for Exchequer revenue and issues are published on the second working day of the following month, thereby ensuring difficulties, if any, will be identified and can be acted upon, if required.</p><p>  - Finally the Council stated that: </p><p>  &quot;A robust return to State creditworthiness &ndash; which has continued to show the improvement highlighted in the September 2012 Fiscal Assessment Report &ndash; would be further reinforced by post-programme precautionary funding arrangements and extensions to the maturities on official loans.&quot; </p><p>  The Government decided on 14 November that Ireland is now in the best position to exit the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance on December 15 without the need to prearrange a new precautionary credit line from our EU and IMF partners. Following a careful and thorough assessment of all of the available options, and various consultations with the European Commission, the ECB, the IMF, the President and members of the Eurogroup, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the NTMA, the decision was taken to exit the programme without a prearranged precautionary facility or backstop. The Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland includes a joint financing package of &euro;85 billion which includes contributions from the EU/EFSM of &euro;22.5 billion, and from the euro area Member States/EFSF of &euro;17.7 billion. Agreement in principle was reached at the 12th &ndash; 13th April 2013 informal Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings in Dublin to increase the maximum average maturity of both types of loan by a further 7 years, bringing the total maximum average maturity of the EFSF loans to 22 years, and the EFSM loans to 19.5 years. The 20th - 21st June meetings of Eurogroup and ECOFIN formally approved these extensions. The principal benefits of the maturities extension is the smoothing of our debt redemption profile, the consequent improvement in our ability to fund ourselves in the financial markets and the beneficial impact on our debt sustainability.</p></reply>

These owners were requested to decide how they wished to pay their LPT in respect of 2014, and confirm this to Revenue by the relevant deadline.  This is because these payment methods did not automatically apply in 2014. </p><p>  I am also advised that property owners who filed a paper LPT1 Return for 2013 received a Form LPT1A (payment instruction) with their letter.  These owners could then choose whether to confirm their payment method for 2014 either in paper or on-line by the relevant deadline.  Property owners who filed their LPT1 Return for 2013 on-line did not receive a paper Form LPT1A (payment instruction) with their letter.  These owners were advised to access their LPT Record on-line using their Property ID, Property PIN and PPSN or tax reference number and to confirm their payment method for 2014 by 27 November 2013.  </p><p>  The Commissioners have confirmed that a small residue of property owners who had raised queries with Revenue or who had unresolved issues on their property records were not included in the bulk issue of letters to property owners in October.  In these cases, a letter will issue to the property owner, along with a Form LPT1A for those filing in paper, when the relevant issue has been resolved.  These property owners can be assured that they will be afforded adequate time to confirm their payment method for 2014 and this will be outlined in the letter they receive from Revenue.  </p><p>  Finally, property owners who paid their 2013 LPT by deduction at source from salary, occupational pension or certain Government payments, or direct debit, those who opted to defer their full LPT liability and those who claimed an exemption, did not receive a letter from Revenue as all of these options will continue to apply for 2014.  No action is required to be taken by these property owners, unless they wish to change to a different payment method for 2014. </p></reply>

Under the original Promissory Note arrangement, the Government was scheduled to make annual payments of &euro;3.1 billion thereby putting significant upward pressure on the amounts to be funded from the market.  The provision of these long-term non-amortising Government bonds to replace the amortising Promissory Notes has therefore had significant benefits from a market  perspective as it ensures that there will be much less issuance of Irish Government bonds into the market over the next decade and beyond than would otherwise have been the case.    </p><p>  Increasing the weighted average life of the debt associated with the funding of IBRC from circa 7-8 years to circa 34-35 years and securing a lower funding cost for the State, result in significant annual interest savings. Combined with the extension of EFSF and EFSM loans, this will result in an estimated reduction of some &euro;40 billion in the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding requirement over the next decade.  It is also expected that there will be a reduction in the underlying General Government deficit of circa &euro;1 billion per annum in the coming years (before transaction costs) reducing the forecast deficit by around 0.6% of GDP annually. Removal of Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short-term borrowings which had to be rolled over on a fortnightly basis was also a significant benefit.</p><p>  Bond markets have reacted well to the impact of these and other improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s financial and fiscal position with the result that Irish bond yields are now at historically low levels. The ten-year yield, for example, is currently at around 3.5%, far lower than had been the case before the State entered the EU/IMF programme. The impact of the announcement in February regarding the Promissory Notes was notable with the yield on the 2025 bond falling by almost half of one per cent (0.5%) in the week following the announcement. Standard and Poor&rsquo;s revised the outlook on Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating to &lsquo;stable&rsquo; on the back of the announcement while Moody&rsquo;s and Fitch Ratings published positive commentaries. </p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland, which holds the Government bonds that replaced the Promissory Notes, will sell  a minimum of the bonds in accordance with the following schedule: to end 2014 (&euro;0.5 billion), 2015-2018 (&euro;0.5 billion per annum), 2019-2023 (&euro;1 billion per annum), 2024 on (&euro;2 billion per annum until all bonds are sold). The schedule of sales takes into account the Central Bank&rsquo;s holding of &euro;3.6 billion of the 2025 bond as a result of the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank. Further amounts can be sold but only where such sale is not disruptive to financial stability.</p></reply>

According to this the purpose of OMT is: &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo;.  It is therefore, aimed at addressing systemic risks for the Euro as a whole and is not country specific in that regard.  Having a credit line does not of itself guarantee access to OMT. It is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. In that respect, in the absence of systemic risk, the position in relation to Ireland is not fundamentally changed by the Government&rsquo;s decision last week not to seek a precautionary credit line.  The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.</p></reply>

The Central Bank advises that it is not in a position to estimate the level of ineligible savings, as the figure would be contingent on a number of factors which would come into play in the event of a DGS payout, for example, the level of accrued interest and the relevance of joint accounts.</p></reply>

Each credit institution covered by the DGS is required to maintain a balance in the Deposit Protection Account (DPA) equivalent to 0.2% of their total deposits in order to fund the DGS.</p><p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that it currently collects data relating to the total deposits of credit institutions so that it can calculate their contributions to the DPA. The Central Bank tells me the figure for total deposits in the financial sector in Ireland is currently &euro;474 billion. However, not all of these deposits are actually covered by the DGS scheme. For example, only amounts up to &euro;100,000 are covered and various deposits are excluded from coverage, such as deposits from large companies and inter-bank deposits.  The Central Bank is currently working with credit institutions in order to receive data on actual coverage levels under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.  Formal powers for the Central Bank to request this data are included in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.</p></reply>

The deputation put forward the view that the new post-primary school being established in 2014 in the area should be configured, along with the existing post-primary school  into a junior school / senior school model rather than as two separate fully vertical schools. </p><p>  I fully considered all aspects of this matter and I am of the view that the schools can operate successfully as two vertical schools. I consider this to be the optimum configuration for the two schools and indeed the best provision that can be made for the pupils in the area. </p><p>  The patron of the two post-primary schools in question has developed a specific management structure for the new educational campus that will be constituted.  In this regard, it is proposed that a single Governing Authority be established in order to guarantee to Parents/Guardians and Students a fair and equitable enrolment policy for both schools and to ensure that the overall management of the campus would be as cohesive and effective as possible.  The Governing Authority will be representative of the stakeholders from both schools together with members of the patron body and will be under an independent Chairperson. This authority would be established under the provisions of the Education and Training Board Act 2013.  Apart from the management of campus facilities, one of the key core functions of the Governing authority will be to develop and co-ordinate the overarching enrolment policy for both schools, following appropriate consultation with the respective Boards of Management of both schools and ensure that the policy is in keeping with the Education and Training Board policy and Department guidelines. This function does not supersede the powers conferred under the Education Act 1998 to the Boards of Managements of the individual schools.</p><p>In addition to the establishment of the single Governing Authority, the Patron will establish a Board of Management for each school. The functions of the Schools and the Boards of Management are those described under the Education Act 1998.</p><p>The pooling of resources of the two schools would mean the provision of the widest possible range of subjects for the pupils in both schools.  This will be particularly important during the initial years of the establishment of the new post-primary school and during the downsizing of the existing  school.   By pooling the pupils from both schools, it will also be possible to offer a subject in one school where the demand from both schools would bring the class size to a viable number.  It is envisaged that both schools will each cater for up to 1,000 pupils  ultimately.</p><p>The existing post-primary school in the area referred to is very highly regarded locally. It is the intention of the patron that the new post-primary school would replicate and achieve the high standards and success attained in the existing school. The synergies generated by the new campus environment should be a significant benefit to both schools towards building on the success of the existing school and should assist them both in attaining high standards. The management and governance structures for the Education Campus that have been developed by the patron body as outlined, seek to ensure that the necessary appropriate relationships and close co-operation will exist between the two schools at all levels, from the Principals and the Boards of Management through to the pupils and the staff. </p><p>With regard to diversity of choice for parents when establishing new schools, my decision on patronage of the new school in question was influenced chiefly by parental preferences.  The new school will cater for pupils of all faiths, backgrounds and belief systems and will be open to pupils of all primary schools in the area.</p><p>My Department is liaising with the patron in relation to start-up accommodation for the school.</p></reply>

The ceilings and savings measures contained in the CER were informed by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) carried out in 2011.  The ceilings published in the CER form the basis upon which the detailed 2014 expenditure allocations were decided by the Government.  The <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report </i>also provided for a new &ldquo;whole-of-year&rdquo; budgetary process, whereby the 2014 ministerial expenditure allocations would be open for scrutiny and discussion before the relevant Oireachtas Committees.  </p><p>  The composition of the budget allocations for 2014 in respect of each Vote were set out in the Expenditure Report 2014 published on 15 October.  The Government took account of a wide range of often competing considerations and policy priorities to decide on the distribution of the resources available in order to strike a balance between bringing sustainability to the public finances while protecting to the greatest extent possible, both the economic recovery and the most vulnerable in society.</p><p>  To put this into context, gross voted spending has been reduced from its peak of &euro;63.1 billion in 2009 to &euro;54.6 billion in 2013.  This represents a reduction of approximately 13.5% between 2009 and 2013.  Estimated voted expenditure for 2014 will be in the region of &euro;52.9 billion with a targeted general Government deficit of 4.8%, a significant reduction from the underlying deficit of 11.2%t at the end of 2011.  The management of the respective expenditure allocations for 2014 will continue to be a matter for each Minister in accordance with overall agreed Government policy.</p><p>  In relation to the troika, the Irish Government's commitment to the EU/IMF programme of financial support was clearly illustrated by our sustained strong record in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and measures while meeting all quantitative targets.  The EU/IMF programme was subject to policy conditionality which was set out in programme documents - the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality (MOU), the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.  The conditionality in these documents was subject to continuing assessment by the Irish Authorities and the EU, IMF, ECB (the troika) to ensure the broad programme objectives were met.  Such assessments were undertaken at the quarterly reviews.  Each update to the programme documents included the protraction or revisions to existing commitments along with new commitments.  </p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the hard policy decisions this Government has made over the last number of years has enabled us to bring our finances back to a sustainable level and just as importantly, the Government decided on 14 November that Ireland is now in the best position to exit the EU/IMF programme of financial assistance on December 15 without the need to pre-arrange a new precautionary credit line from our EU and IMF partners.</p></reply>

Indeed, data released in the Exchequer Statement of 2 October indicated that the Exchequer primary deficit target outlined in the EU/IMF programme was met for the twelfth consecutive quarter. </p><p>  In order to achieve the general government deficit target of below 3% of GDP by 2015, all components of the public finances must make an appropriate contribution. In this context, reducing the Exchequer Pay Bill has been an important element in reducing public expenditure.  Public Servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State, through a number of measures which have helped to reduce the Public Service pay bill from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009, to an estimated &euro;14.1 billion in 2013. </p><p>  Public Service management has worked with staff representatives to secure significant cost reductions and to deliver necessary reforms and work place changes, through the Public Service Croke Park agreement and most recently through the Haddington Road agreement. The benefits of the Croke Park agreement have been significant as evidenced by the final report of the Implementation Body. That report concluded that the agreement facilitated significant cost savings, amounting to &euro;1.8 billion over its lifetime, comprising of almost &euro;1 billion in pay savings and over &euro;800m in non-pay efficiency savings. The Body also concluded that the vast majority of commitments around cost extraction, reforms and changed work practices had been substantially delivered. </p><p>  More recently, the Haddington Road agreement, which came into force on 1 July, sets out a number of measures aimed at reducing the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by 2016. In addition to these cost saving measures, the Agreement also provides for an additional 15 million working hours across all sectors of the Public Service. The additional hours will ensure that public service management is able to maintain service delivery while also enabling the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious reform agenda.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of Public Service managers across every sector of the Public Service to make full use of these additional hours and the other hard-won workplace flexibilities agreed in Haddington Road. In order to harness the full potential of these additional hours, it will be essential that public service management continue to evaluate innovative ways of utilising these hours over the next three years.</p><p>  Where public service unions and the Government sign up to collective agreements, in this case the Haddington Road agreement, I am satisfied that both unions and management are committed to the delivery of the terms of those agreements. </p></reply>

Individual allocations across Agencies will be presented in early December as part of the Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p>  The Department's current expenditure ceiling for 2014 has been set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at &euro;339m. This includes the total Pay, Pensions and Non-Pay expenditure provisions for the Department, its offices and its agencies for next year. The distribution of this current expenditure provision will also be presented in early December as part of the Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p><b>Budget 2014 Impact</b></p><p>  Budget 2014 will enable the delivery by these agencies of a range of enterprise and research and innovation supports, which are crucial in achieving a return to economic growth through providing access to finance and growing innovation in Ireland.  </p><p>  The measures this will deliver include:</p><p>- Delivery of DJEI measures under Action Plan for Jobs 2014, to be announced early next year;</p><p>- Delivery, by IDA Ireland, on its job creation targets as set out in IDA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Horizon 2020&rdquo; Strategy, which covers the 5 year period 2010-2014.  The targets that have been set in Horizon 2020 are:</p><p>  - 105,000 new jobs (62,000 in IDA supported companies and a further 43,000 indirect).</p><p>  - 640 Investments.</p><p>  - 50% of investments located outside Dublin and Cork.</p><p>  - 20% of greenfield investments originating from emerging markets by 2014.</p><p>  - Annual client spend of &euro;1.7bn in R, D&amp;amp;I by 2014;</p><p>- Continued supports, through EI and SFI to drive the innovation performance of indigenous industry and commercialisation of research;</p><p>- Enterprise Ireland will target some 12,000 new jobs and generate &euro;17.5billion in exports. The Agency will also support 95 new High Potential Start-Up companies with commitments to create e 2,100 new jobs;</p><p>- Continued investment by EI in mentoring, management development and lean programmes, to increase business efficiency and competitiveness, aiding sustainability and protecting jobs.  EI will also provide export-related supports to companies that want to scale and develop new markets;</p><p>- Provision of ongoing support, through Enterprise Ireland, for new R&amp;amp;D investment and activity in companies and for collaborative projects between companies and Irish third level institutions;</p><p>- Participation by hundreds of companies in IDA and EI-funded trade events and missions throughout 2014;</p><p>- 2-3 new, large, internationally visible SFI-funded research centres, in sectors of national strategic importance.  SFI will look to invest &euro;10m - &euro;15m in these centres in 2014 in collaborations with industry;</p><p>- Continued support to over 20 world-class SFI research centres and to a cohort of 3,000 researchers to maintain and drive Ireland&rsquo;s job creation strategy;</p><p>- A national level &ldquo;Health Innovation Hub&rdquo;, to drive collaboration between the health system and commercial enterprises leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies, products, services and </p><p>- start-ups emerging from within the health system and/or firms.&rdquo;  This will deliver a significant positive benefit for both the life-sciences and ICT sectors of industry, both of which are of strategic importance to Ireland in terms of jobs and exports, representing 50,000 jobs and exports of &euro;51 billion;</p><p>- Provision, by InterTrade Ireland, of ongoing all-island programmes and activities designed to raise awareness among SMEs of the value of engaging in cross-border trade;</p><p>- An additional &euro;3.5million in supports for start-ups and growing businesses through the CEBs/ Local Enterprise Offices.  The CEB&rsquo;s Capital allocation is utilised in direct grant disbursement to eligible micro-enterprises and through the provision of a range of &ldquo;soft supports&rdquo; &ndash; training, mentoring and business advice services to support start-ups and developing businesses. The CEBs will continue to use their capital funding to promote business start-ups and to develop existing businesses to support job retention and creation in line with Government policy on maximising job creation through appropriate use of available Exchequer funding. It is envisaged that some of the additional monies will be used for the delivery of a targeted Programme to increase the level of Youth Entrepreneurship and also to establish a Programme of targeted supports to the micro enterprise sector with a specific sectoral and / or geographical perspective. </p><p>  Budget 2014 will also enable the continued delivery of almost &euro;2.5billion in new, non-bank credit schemes, targeted at the full range of businesses from micro-enterprises through SMEs to mid-sized Irish exporting businesses and high-growth technology firms:</p><p>- &euro;850 million through three SME funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund</p><p>- &euro;225 million development capital scheme</p><p>- &euro;700 million Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018</p><p>- &euro;10 million international start-up fund</p><p>- &euro;120 million second call under Innovation Fund Ireland</p><p>- &euro;90 million micro-finance scheme</p><p>- &euro;450 million credit guarantee scheme</p><p> I issued a comprehensive Press Release on the impact of the Budget on 15 October and this is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link below: </p></reply>

However, if over the course of the year their gross annual income was less than &euro;26,000 a refund of the health contribution may be due.     </p><p>  In order to confirm that a refund is due my Department must carry out a manual check to ensure that the correct rate of PRSI was applied over the course of the relevant tax year.  It is not possible to identify the number of people who are entitled to a health contribution refund until this check is carried out.  </p><p>  To date my Department has received over 290,000 applications for health contribution refunds.  The processing of these applications is up to date and has resulted in approximately 48% of applicants receiving refunds.</p><p>  Applications for refunds must be made within four years of the end of the year that the contribution was paid.  For example, you must apply for a refund of health contributions paid in 2009 by 31 December 2013.  Any contributions paid prior to 1 January 2009 are outside the time limit for making a claim.  </p><p>  The position with regard to entitlement is that if a person earned more than &euro;26,000 in 2009 and/or 2010 they were liable to pay the health contribution and are not due a refund.  If a person earned less than &euro;26,000 and never earned more than &euro;500 in any one week they would not have been charged the health contribution and are not eligible for a refund. </p><p>  A person may be entitled to a refund of the health contribution if they have earned less than &euro;26,000 in 2009 and/or 2010 and earned more than &euro;500 in any particular week in those years. </p><p>  Also employees who are Medical Card holders; recipients of social welfare widow's/widower's pension; one parent family payment; deserted wife's benefit, or certain EU pensions and payments, are exempt from the health element of the PRSI contribution (i.e. they are liable at the sub-class of contribution - A2, B2, C2, etc.).  Refunds arise if the full contribution has been paid. </p><p>  The health contribution was included in the Universal Social Charge (USC) with effect from 1 January 2011 and no health contribution refunds arise after that date.</p></reply>

The Finance Bill (No. 2), 2013, currently before the D&aacute;il, provides for the new credit which will have the same value as the current tax credit and will be available to the primary carer of a child.  The Minister for Finance also informed the D&aacute;il during the second stage debate on the current Finance Bill that he will be bringing forward an amendment at the committee stage of that Bill, which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations where the primary carer has no tax liability.</p><p>  The current arrangements in relation to the assessment of maintenance payments made to a recipient of one parent family payment are designed to encourage the payment of maintenance. Where a recipient of one parent family payment is in receipt of maintenance payments, half of the value of these payments is assessed as means and the rate of payment is adjusted accordingly. In addition, where a recipient has rent or mortgage payments up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week, these costs can be fully offset against any maintenance paid and no reduction occurs in the rate of one-parent family payment where the maintenance received does not exceed housing costs (subject to a maximum of  such costs of &euro;95.23 per week).</p><p>  Accordingly, the impact of the current welfare arrangements means that, in many cases, any reduction or increase in the level of maintenance paid can have no effect or relatively minimal effect on the rate of one parent family payment payable.</p><p>  It is not possible, at this stage, to quantify the number of one parent family payment recipients currently benefiting from maintenance payments whose welfare payment rates may be indirectly affected by any potential behavioural changes consequent on the proposed tax measure and, accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the estimate for that payment in 2014.  I will ask my officials to monitor any potential impacts during 2014.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including them on the Record of Protected Structures.

Its purpose is to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, uniformly and consistently, as an aid in the protection and conservation of the built heritage.  As Minister, I recommend structures rated as being of 'regional importance' or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures.  However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures is a reserved function of the relevant planning authorities, in this case Kildare County Council.</p><p>  I am advised that there are 12 buildings in the Curragh Camp recorded in the NIAH survey of 2003, which were recommended to be included in the Record of Protected Structures of Kildare County Council.

My Department has no record of having received reasons for non-inclusion of the remaining structures and will formally enquire of Kildare County Council as to the reasons the remaining 5 structures were not included in the Record.</p></reply>

The original derogation with regard to the use of Irish in EU institutions applied for 5 years from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011 (Regulation No. 920/2005).

It is hoped to bring the matter forward for consideration by Government in early 2014.</p><p>  It has been estimated that the number of posts to be filled could be in the region of 180, if the derogation were ended. These posts would include positions such as linguistic administrators (translators), conference interpreters, lawyer linguists, proof readers and secretaries. In this context, I would like to note that my Department has been working closely with the European institutions and with other interested parties for a number of years to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified personnel are available to meet the needs arising from the recognition of Irish as an official and working language of the EU. In addition to funding a range of specialised third-level courses, my Department also provides funding to Fiontar in Dublin City University for the development of Irish language terminology for the EU terminology database InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE).</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. This target must be achieved in order for Ireland to meet its binding obligation of 16% of total energy demand to be met from renewable sources by 2020. All of the renewable energy support schemes provide subsidies to eligible projects as opposed to grant aid.The AER was a series of 6 competitive tender schemes to support new renewable generation that were run to the mid 2000s. AER was subsequently replaced by the feed-in tariff scheme known as REFIT. The AER schemes were all introduced prior to full electricity market liberalisation.   REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the necessary certainty required to finance their projects. Both AER and REFIT are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy. </p><p>  The estimates for how much subsidy is funded by way of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported. The following table presents the costs for both AER and REFIT since 2003 (the 2003 figure for AER is cumulative from the year 2000): <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>AER </th><th>REFIT</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2013/14</td><td>-8.0</td><td>51.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012/13</td><td>7.1</td><td>47.5</td></tr><tr><td>2011/12</td><td>0.7</td><td>35.8</td></tr><tr><td>2010/11</td><td>13.5</td><td>29.7</td></tr><tr><td>2009/10</td><td>24.3</td><td>39.8</td></tr><tr><td>2008/9</td><td>-58.4</td><td>24.4</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>0.4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>-29.9</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>0.2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>12.3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>16.1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2003</td><td>6.6</td><td></td></tr></table>  In Decision CER/13/168 of 31 July 2013, the CER has calculated the payment by customer category for the levy period 2013 - 2014.

Ireland's NREAP, which can be downloaded from my Department's website, assumes Ireland's 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum. In terms of progress to date, the provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 7.1% of the overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources with 3% coming from bioenergy sources including biofuels, solid biomass, biogas and landfill gas.   </p><p>  The principal policies are in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy. In the electricity sector, the REFIT schemes are the main policy supports and offer guaranteed tariffs for electricity from wind, hydropower and a number of categories of biomass. The REFIT3 scheme also supports biomass-fuelled high efficiency cogeneration which, in addition to renewable electricity, supports renewable heat. In the transport sector, the penetration of renewable energy will grow mainly with the increased use of sustainable biofuels which is supported by way of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme. </p><p>  Additionally, my Department is currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy, which will set out the actions required to optimise the bioenergy sector&rsquo;s contribution to the 2020 renewable energy target.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Galway, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Galway. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>-  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector, the results of which will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014. </p><p>  This process will include a detailed specification of our requirements to deliver on the commitments in the National Broadband Plan. In designing any State-led procurement, my department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules in relation to the technology to be rolled out. The European Commission's guidelines set out that as different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, the tender should not favour or exclude any particular technology or network platform. </p><p>  My Department is also considering the use of the telecommunications duct that was installed as part of the Tuam Town Water Distribution and Main Drainage Project. </p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.  </p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is <b>vacant</b> for specified purposes. These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are <b>vacant</b> pending redevelopment.</p><p>  A small number of urban local authorities have historically had separate legal provision enabling a refund of 50% of rates on <b>vacant</b> properties. While the same criteria for refunds apply, 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of <b>vacant</b>   premises in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork. These legislative provisions are:</p><p>- section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930;</p><p>- section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934; and</p><p>- section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941.   </p><p>  The majority of local authorities are, currently, subject to the provisions of the 1946 Act and the 100% refund regime.   </p><p>  Section 31(b) of the Local Government Bill 2013 seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1946 by reducing the 100% refund regime to 50% for all local authorities, effectively reducing the refund rate to the same level as currently pertains in Dublin, Limerick and Cork cities. </p><p>  In introducing the Bill at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last month I indicated that I am fully aware of the difficult economic environment in which many businesses and property owners continue to operate. I further indicated that there are numerous factors to be considered when proposing an amendment to rates legislation including its effect on business sentiment and its impact on local government finances.  I intend that this provision should not be interpreted as a further cost on business and I gave a commitment to the House to revert to this matter again as the Bill makes its way through the Oireachtas to ensure that there are no unintended consequences in how the provision would work in practice. </p></reply>

The Act provides that Irish Water is required to submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition, the Act provides that the annual report and accounts are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013, which will be published shortly, will provide Irish Water with responsibility for the provision of water services.  The new legislation will also require Irish Water, when it is preparing strategic and capital investment plans, to consult with the local authorities and to have regard to regional and local development plans.   </p><p>  The 2013 Act enabled the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to provide advice to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the development of policy regarding the regulation of the provision of water services.  The Water Services (No. 2) Bill will provide for the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services within the CER.  While the primary function of the CER will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure that a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them, it will also be responsible for approving the tariffs to be charged by Irish Water.  In fulfilling its functions, the CER will have regard, inter alia, to the need to ensure that there is an efficient system for the provision of water services and the need to promote the conservation of water.  It is envisaged that, as part of its customer protection role, the CER will establish a dispute resolution service for customers of Irish Water.  This approach is in line with the services CER already provide for customers in the energy sector.</p></reply>

The period for public submissions under this review closed on 27 September 2013.  Consideration of these submissions is currently underway with a view to evaluating their content in the context of the review.</p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I asked the Housing &amp;amp; Sustainable Communities Agency to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures.  I have received an interim draft of the review from the Agency and I intend to issue an updated circular letter to local authorities shortly arising from some the Agency&rsquo;s findings.  However, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order fully to assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures.  This additional work is underway and I expect to make further determinations in the coming months.</p><p>  On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme, in respect of distressed mortgages in the commercial sector, on a pilot basis in February 2012.  This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.  A pilot mortgage to rent scheme for the most acute cases of local authority mortgage arrears which was launched earlier in 2013 , in Westmeath Count y and Dublin City Councils, has now been completed.  It is intended to implement this scheme throughout the local authority sector in the near future.</p></reply>

The term State Boards is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.  Details of all appointments and vacancies which occurred since March 2011 are set out below along with details of those cases where expressions of interest were sought.</p><p><b><i>Classification of Films Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  There are currently nine vacancies on the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 44 applications were received.  I expect to make appointments to these positions in the near future.</p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>  The Courts Service Board has 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice. Eighteen vacancies occurred.  There have been 18* appointments, three of which were individuals nominated by myself including a civil servant from my Department.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board is appointed by the Government and consists of a Chairperson, a member nominated by the representatives associations and a member nominated by the Government.  The Chairperson is appointed on the nomination of the Ministers for Justice &amp;amp; Equality and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform in agreement with the representative associations.  Four vacancies occurred and four appointments were made to the board.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time. One case remains at present.  The 9th appointee is a civil servant.</p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>  Eight vacancies occurred.  Eight* appointments were made to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Three of the appointments were individuals nominated by myself.</p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>  Fifteen vacancies occurred.  Of the 15 appointments to this Board, nine were civil or public servants.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>  Four vacancies occurred. Four appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.</p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority (NDA)</i></b></p><p>  One vacancy occurred.  One appointment was made to the board of the National Disability Authority (NDA).  I made the appointment after seeking expressions of interest of which I received 12 applications.  This appointment was from a public applicant.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the current board of the NDA is due to expire on 21 December 2013.  The vacancies are for 12 ordinary members and a chairperson.  On 23 October an invitation for expressions of interest was placed on my Department's website with a closing date for receipt of applications of 15 November.</p><p><b><i>Parole Board</i></b></p><p>  Ten vacancies occurred.  There were ten appointments made to the Parole Board.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  Four vacancies occurred.  The Government appointed four people on 3 April, 2012.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority (PSA)</i></b></p><p>  Eleven vacancies occurred.  Eleven appointments were made out of which seven positions were advertised as the remaining four positions, in accordance with the relevant legislation, are to be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 29 applications were received.  Six of the seven appointments made following public advertising were drawn for the applications received.</p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>  Three vacancies occurred.  Three appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority, of which, in accordance with the legislation, one is a nominee of the Law Society, one is a nominee of the Bar Council and the 3rd the elected Property Registration Authority staff representative.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>  The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority</i></b></p><p>  Eleven appointments were made to the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA).  I received 114 applications after seeking expressions of interest from members of the public.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years.  The proposed Chairperson appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.</p><p><b><i>The Equality Authority</i></b></p><p>  The fourteen outgoing board members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012, and therefore the issues of selection did not arise.  The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form a new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Authority Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The  Working Group that I established to advise me on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new Commission in its Report of April 2012 recommended that an independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing the new members.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.</p><p>  In November 2012 advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media.  The independent panel forwarded its recommendations of 14 names in March 2013.  While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government has appointed the 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year or 5 year basis to ensure that the term of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.  On 31 May 2013, I appointed 12 of their number to the board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two bodies are dissolved.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that since my previous reply to Parliamentary Question 382, which he put down for answer on 18 June 2013, both the Censorship of Publications Board and the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board have transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  In addition, the Children Detention Schools Board of Management has transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  * Includes 2 ex-officio members who were omitted from reply to Parliamentary Question No. 382 of 18 June, 2013.</p></reply>

The person concerned subsequently consented to deportation and against this background a Deportation Order was made in respect of him on 6th May, 2004.

It is open to the person to make an application for stamp 4 status, however, as I indicated in my earlier replies to the Deputy, based on the immigration status and known circumstances of the person, she does not qualify for stamp 4 status and accordingly such an application has little prospect of success.</p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions.</p><p>  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

In accordance with the prescribing instructions and information provided by the Irish Medicines Board the Defence Forces Medical Corps take all necessary precautions in assessing the suitability of personnel before prescribing Lariam.  Personnel are screened both before and after deployments and all necessary actions are taken to ensure that those with contraindications to Lariam are not prescribed the medication.

Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence.  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011.  I appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff.  As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised.  Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012. </p><p>   The non-military ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board, a civilian doctor, retired at the end of June 2013.

Its objective is to improve the productivity and profitability of participants&rsquo; beef enterprises by focusing on five areas: financial management, grassland management, herd health, animal breeding/welfare and producing animals to market specifications. Under the BTAP, participants engage in peer-to-peer learning by joining discussion groups which are facilitated by professional agricultural advisors drawn from Teagasc and the private sector.</p><p>  The Terms and Conditions and programme for BTAP 2012 were devised following wide ranging consultation with stakeholders amongst whom were Teagasc, the Irish Farmers Association (IFA), Meat Industry Ireland (MII), Veterinary Ireland, and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF).</p><p>  BTAP payments must comply with EU rules regarding the cumulative amount of state aid granted for primary agricultural production over any three-year period. Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1535/2007 provides that such aid is restricted to a maximum of &euro;7,500 per claimant over any period of three years. </p><p>  While the BTAP is funded from Exchequer funds it is subject to the De Minimis part of EU State aid rules. However, these do not require my Department to submit the BTAP Terms and Conditions for approval by the EU Commission. </p><p>  My Department carried out a review of the Programme and made some changes based on experience from its first year of operation in 2012. Changes in the 2013 BTAP included further clarification of the role and responsibilities of the facilitator, clarification of the position for farmers who had both cattle and sheep and how they would be treated for payments purposes if they are participating in both the BTAP and the new Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP). In addition, two new tasks relating to were the added to the menu of Programme options available to participants. These were (i) pregnancy scanning of breeding cows and heifers and recording the information obtained on an ICBF database and (ii) the completion of Bord Bia&rsquo;s Carbon Navigator / Footprint Calculator together with a laboratory analysis of at least two silage samples.</p></reply>

New opportunities and market outlets are emerging for farmers and the rural economy in producing bioenergy as a form of renewable energy.  The bioenergy sector offers the opportunity to offset Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported fossil fuels, and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time providing new market opportunities for the agriculture sector.</p><p>  Challenging targets exist under the Renewable Energy Directive whereby Ireland is required to achieve 16% of its total final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  The 16% target is broken down into renewable energy contributions of 40% of electricity, 12% of heat and 10% of transport.</p><p>  Since 2007 my Department has administered the Bioenergy Scheme offering grant-aid to support the establishment of the energy crops miscanthus and willow.  To the end of 2013 over 3,300 hectares of these crops have been established.</p><p>  Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is another area that has been supported by my Department.  A Scheme of Investment Aid for Demonstration On-Farm Waste Processing Facilities was introduced by my Department in June 2006 under the aegis of the 2000-2006 National Development Plan, with funding of &euro;4m as provided for in that Plan.  In 2007, grant-aid was approved under the Scheme for the development of ten on-farm anaerobic digestion facilities.  The grant-aid is payable only on completion of the work concerned and one grant of &euro;400,000 has been drawn down to-date.  Applicants, on request, are being provided with extensions until end-June 2014 to complete the investment works needed in order to draw down the grant-aid available.</p><p>  My Department also provided funding for research under the Stimulus fund 2007&ndash;2013 to three projects related to anaerobic digestion which are ongoing.  The price supports via Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff for AD announced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, indexed and offered on a 15-year basis, have the potential to underpin the development of the technology in Ireland.  The introduction of these tariffs was supported by my Department.</p><p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency, has sought to encourage the use in practice of the &ldquo;product not waste&rdquo; scenario in relation to Animal By-Products.  Details available to my Department show that some 35,000 tonnes of tallow was used as a fuel in Ireland in 2011.</p><p>  The state supported afforestation programme has resulted in a forest estate which is now providing an increasing level of renewable biomass from thinnings and from sawmilling residues. It is estimated that in 2012 over one million cubic metres of wood, more than one third of the annual harvest, was used for energy generation. National projections indicate that as harvest increases over the coming decades so will the contribution of the forest sector to renewable biomass.  These activities contribute significantly to mitigating emissions from fossil fuels as well as contributing to rural development and jobs.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are contributing to the development of a Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources National Bioenergy Strategy to be published shortly.  This will take account of the various strands of bioenergy that are dealt with within my Department, with a view to maximising their potential contribution to achieving renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond.</p></reply>

I can confirm that there is currently one vacancy on the board of management of the AAI, four vacancies for the FSA, one vacancy for the NEWB and no vacancies for the Children Detention Schools. </p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. </p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of  7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. </p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the board. </p><p>  The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency.  The current membership of the board of the Family Support Agency will be appointed to the board of the new Child and Family Agency when it is established.</p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  </p><p><b>Appointments to State Boards under the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs since March, 2011 </b></p><p><b>National Educational Welfare Board</b><table><tr><th>Board Member</th><th>Term </th></tr><tr><td>Nuala Doherty (Chair)</td><td>30/07/12 &ndash;

The Department raised this issue at EU level during negotiations on EU Regulation 1169/2011 governing the provision of food information to consumers. The European Commission agreed to prepare a report on the presence of trans fats in foods and in the overall diet of the EU population by the end of 2014. The aim of the report is to assess the impact of appropriate means to enable consumers to make healthier food and dietary choices, including the provision of information on trans fats to consumers or restrictions on their use. The Commission will accompany this report with a legislative proposal, if appropriate. The Commission&rsquo;s report will inform future action in this area.</p></reply>

When this review is completed, the Government's approval will be sought to notify the draft regulations to the EU Commission and Member States under the Technical Standards Directive.

Following on from centralisation,150 staff operate the scheme.  All local staff were permanent HSE employees and were redeployed to various frontline services as vacancies/needs arose locally following on from the voluntary retirements in the HSE.  Accordingly, annual savings of approximately &euro;9m can be attributed directly to the centralisation programme. </p><p>  Now that the Medical Card Scheme is underpinned with a standard foundation, which enables better governance, more transparency and the use of efficient modern processes, the HSE continues to move ahead with additional improvements.  I am satisfied that this key strategic change project has not only delivered significant savings but also delivers a more efficient, effective and economic service and it is vital to deliver future changes in the health environment.</p></reply>

The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently persist around the country.</p><p>  To assist in addressing some of these variations, I announced the allocation of &euro;1m in funding for autism and early intervention services in 2012.  Based on a report prepared by the HSE, I approved &euro;300,000 of this funding, which equates to five therapists posts, for Beechpark services in Dublin, north of the Liffey, to address the pressing needs of its catchment area, with a particular emphasis on reducing waiting times.</p><p>  Following ongoing discussions on the best way forward in relation to Beechpark Autism Services, the HSE confirmed that this approved funding would be allocated to HSE Dublin North East in 2013 for Beechpark in order to address the waiting list for services in Dublin North East.  This provides, in the first instance, for the recruitment of the necessary five therapy staff.   This  process  is under way.  The HSE has also assigned a Disability Manager in Dublin North East to oversee the re-configuration of early intervention services for children and young people with disabilities in the region, in line with the national Progressing Disabilities Programme.</p><p>  I separately established an Independent Review Group in 2012, to look at the Beechpark model of services and how resources could be used in the best and most effective way, in light of the HSE Review of Autism Services and the re-organisation of services under way in line with the 0-18's Programme.  Further funding in relation to Beechpark and other regions of the country, was put on hold, pending the outcome of this Review.  This Review is expected to be concluded shortly.  The issue of service levels and funding to be provided  for the disability sector is being considered in the context of the development of  the HSE's National Service Plan for 2014.</p></reply>

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>
