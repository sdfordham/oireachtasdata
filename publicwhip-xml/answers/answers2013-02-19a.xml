The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Assuming this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue for the Irish economy this year, based on historic spending patterns.  The 2013 Estimates allocations to Failte Ireland include a special provision of &euro;7 million which was specifically provided for The Gathering. This amount is to be used exclusively to fund the promotion, development and legacy of the event.</p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. There are now over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year. Along with well-established events and festivals, we are also supporting a specially targeted set of events for the Gathering, such as the very successful New Year's Eve Event in Dublin which marked the start of the festivities.</p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue can only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. The agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. Print, online and TV advertising is also being used to promote the initiative while the upcoming programme of overseas Ministerial visits during the St. Patrick's Day period will again be used to highlight this special year for Irish tourism.</p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging, I believe that all tourism stakeholders must continue to work hard to ensure that our targets are achieved.  I have said previously that the benefits of participation in the event will also have longer term positive consequences in terms of additional annual events as well as the strengthened connections being estabished as a result of the initiative.</p></reply>

With the commencement of the relevant sections of the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012, the RSA became the driver licensing authority for Ireland with effect from 12th January 2013.</p><p>  The RSA proposes to operate the service through three separate contracts related to licence card production, back-office processing services and front-office customer interface. The Authority will also operate a specialist unit from its headquarters in Ballina. Responsibility for procuring the service of the three contracted bodies rests with the RSA and I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for reply to the specific aspects raised.</p><p>  However, in relation to the agent network service, I understand from the RSA that this will be in place by the end of September this year. Until then, licence applications will continue to be made at the Motor Tax Office and I want to thank those local authority employees in the Motor Tax Offices who are facilitating this changeover.</p><p>  The locations of the offices have not yet been identified however I am informed that the 35 centre locations will provide service to 98% of the population within a 50km radius.  There will be a minimum of one location per county and the new network of offices will be open Monday through Saturday and during lunchtime, a major improvement for drivers, especially those in employment. In addition, they will have longer opening hours to facilitate customers who may not be able to apply for their licence during normal working hours. When the location of these centres is finalised, their locations will be announced though a public information campaign.</p></reply>

This will help to publicise the Gathering and enhance the visitor experience for those visiting the country during the period around the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day weekend.  I have also invited my Ministerial colleagues, the local authorities, bus and rail companies and airports to green prominent buildings in their care and the Gathering Team are disseminating the concept through their network across the country.  A number of high profile buildings have been confirmed already and, together with Minister of State Hayes, I hope to make an announcement on the subject over the coming weeks.</p><p>  In relation to alcohol sponsorship, I understand that the St. Patrick's Festival Company, which organises the national parade and related events in Dublin, has a policy of not seeking sponsorship from the alcohol sector.</p></reply>

In relation to the Ryanair Offer for that stake, it is the Government's strongly held view that a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market.</p><p>  Promoting competition among airlines serving the Irish market is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s aviation strategy and the continued presence of at least two strong competing airlines serving Ireland&rsquo;s air transport needs is regarded as important. At the moment, we are fortunate to have two very strong and profitable airlines operating in Ireland and the competitive dynamic between the two companies has brought significant benefits for Irish consumers.  The Government wants to see continued competition in the market.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the most recent offer by Ryanair for Aer Lingus the Government announced in December 2012 that it was not prepared to support the Offer because of the significant negative impact the offer would have on Ireland's air transport market.  The European Commission is conducting a detailed examination of the Offer under the EU Merger Control Rules and it has consulted a wide range of stakeholders, including my Department, on the remedies packages put forward by Ryanair to address the competition concerns identified by the Commission.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-19a.43.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900069#WRA03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 129, 156, 176 and 792 together.</p><p>  These questions relate to the sponsorship of sport by the alcohol industry.</p><p>  I fully support the central aim of the National Substance Misuse Strategy in reducing the level of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. I am very supportive of a number of the measures proposed including minimum pricing, health warning labels and statutory advertising codes. However, I am concerned that placing constraints on sporting organisations by eliminating the alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have negative impacts on the development and availability of sport and consequently on our efforts to maintain and increase sporting participation at local level.</p><p>  There are huge and obvious economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport. It is very important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.</p><p>  In view of the current economic constraints, Government investment in sport has had to be reduced in recent years. The imposition of a ban on sponsorship would further undermine the efforts of sporting organisations to be self-sufficient.</p><p>  It is estimated that sport sponsorship by the alcohol industry amounts to around &#8364;30m per year. To place this in context, the Irish Sports Council&#8217;s budget is just over &#8364;40m. Difficulties currently being experienced by some of our high profile teams and events in securing sponsorship suggest that the funding lost might not readily be replaced by alternative sources. Sports organisations may well be placed in a position where they have to curtail their development programmes, which are pivotal to promoting participation at all levels.</p><p>  I believe that any measures introduced should be evidence based, effective and proportionate. Furthermore, any decision in this area should have regard to the potential downsides that may occur. </p><p>  There is no evidence to show that a ban on sponsorship would be effective in terms of reducing alcohol consumption amongst youths. Indeed, given the 'Loi Evin', it is worth noting the comparisons between Ireland and France in the 2011 <i>ESPAD Report on Substance Use Among Students in European Countries, </i>which was published last June. This report monitors substance use among 15&#8211;16-year-old European students in order to monitor trends within, as well as between, countries. Since 1999, the proportion of these young people reporting having had five or more drinks on one occasion during the past 30 days in Ireland has decreased by 17% to 40%. In comparison this has increased by 11% in France to 44%.</p><p>  It should be remembered that Britain, having recognised the failure of the 'Loi Evin' in France to reduce alcohol consumption by young people, decided not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport for evidence based reasons. We should not implement policies merely for the &#8216;optics&#8217; but we should only do so after an evidence based cost benefit analysis.</p><p>  Furthermore, it must be recognised that many of the major sporting events in which Irish teams compete are international events and are directly or indirectly broadcast into the State by foreign broadcasters. Were Ireland to ban alcohol sponsorship, the only effect would be to exclude the Irish sporting organisations from sponsorship money while the advertising occurred anyway.</p><p>  There are also a number of practical difficulties at a local level which must be considered, for example will pubs and hotels be allowed to sponsor teams? How will the difficulties with sports which operate on an all- Ireland level be addressed?</p><p>  Instead of imposing a ban on alcohol sponsorship, my preference is for the introduction of a voluntary system, such as currently exists in Australia, where the Department of Health would compensate sporting organisations who voluntarily give up such sponsorship and moving to the introduction of a ban only when it is shown that the money lost can be replaced through alternative sponsors.</p><p>  Certainly, I do not think that the government should impose such a law without fully compensating sports organisations for the revenue lost in the same way as we compensated political parties when corporate and private donations were restricted.</p></reply>

When the Heads of the Bill are ready, they will be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport for their consideration prior to drafting.</p><p>  Last month I appointed Rose Hynes as Chairman of the SAA. On 23 January last, prior to her appointment, Ms Hynes appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and outlined some of the challenges and opportunities facing the company. In that context I might add that I expect her to take on the role of Chairman designate for the New Co which is in the process of being established.</p><p>  A process to recruit a Chief Executive for the Shannon Airport Authority and the new Shannon entity is currently underway and I intend making further appointments to the board of the SAA shortly.</p><p>  As Ms Hynes has already pointed out, the serious downward trajectory in passenger numbers at Shannon over the past five years must be halted as a priority, and then reversed. While it is clearly early days, a number of airlines have announced plans for new or expanded services which augers well for the newly independent airport. To date, none of these have been displaced from other airports which is encouraging.</p><p>  In the meantime both I and my colleague, Minister Bruton, have written to the Chairmen of the SAA and Shannon Development requesting that they and their management teams work closely together over the coming months to ensure an orderly transition to the establishment of the new Shannon entity. In this regard also, Minister Bruton appointed Ms Hynes to the board of Shannon Development last week and some further common appointments will be made to the boards of the SAA and Shannon Development to maximise synergies between the two ahead of the merger.</p></reply>

Progress was made at the end of 2012 on the sale of non-core assets, in particular the sale of Spencer Dock properties. The resolution of CIE's financial position will involve increased borrowing facilities for non-capital purposes. Discussions are continuing to secure additional banking facilities to ensure adequate funding into 2013.</p><p>  Any such funding will rely upon the delivery and implementation of a convincing business plan. CIE has undertaken an aggressive business planning process with the aim of returning to a break-even position and achieving a sustainable debt position in subsequent years. While the Group is expected to make a loss this year, it aims to achieve breakeven by mid-2014. Given the pressure on the public finances, there is no possibility of additional funding by the Exchequer in 2013. The implementation of a credible business plan will therefore be essential to CIE&rsquo;s financial recovery in the period ahead.</p></reply>

Therefore, I confirmed my intention to begin work on a tourism policy review when I published my Departmental Priorities for 2013.</p><p>  I have asked my officials to examine various approaches to such a review, including the implications for timing and resources required.  At this early stage, no final decisions have been made regarding how such a review will be carried out and its final format, and I am interested in any thoughts the Deputies may have on this.  However, I am considering a multistage process, in which I would first outline my overall approach in a draft statement later this year, followed by a consultation process, before finalising the policy. I believe that the Oireachtas Joint Committee that covers tourism could have an important role in the consultation process. Once this policy has been set, it would provide a robust foundation for a broader tourism strategy and action plan reflecting these policy priorities and the views of key stakeholders and consumers.  The Government&rsquo;s priorities for tourism were outlined in the Programme for Government 2011.  In the context of the challenges facing both the sector and the wider economy, rather than pursue separate strategies for the tourism sector, the Government integrated tourism into the broader economic strategic framework.  This overall s approach, complemented by the work of the tourism agencies, has worked well to date.</p><p>  Key Programme for Government commitments were reflected in the Government&rsquo;s subsequent Jobs Initiative, with immediate priority actions set out in the annual Action Plans for Jobs.  The Government has already delivered on several measures to reduce costs for tourists and for tourism businesses, therefore enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, and last week&rsquo;s Finance Bill provides a further stimulus for the tourism sector.</p><p>  It is too early to comment on any specific treatment, in the policy review, of particular markets such as Great Britain or of specific destinations such as Cork.  In addition, it is important to distinguish what are essentially operational matters, such as the approach to the development of specific destinations or markets, from the higher-level policy priorities.  Since specific marketing strategies for Britain are an operational matter for Tourism Ireland Limited, I have referred this aspect of Deputy McHugh's question to Tourism Ireland for additional material.  Since the development of individual regions is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I have referred this aspect of Deputy Buttimer's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply.  In each case, please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

While the number of visits from the higher spending Mainland Europe, North America and long haul Markets all registered growth, the number of overseas visits from Britain were down by 3.6%. While the rate of decline in visit numbers from Britain continued to slow towards the end of 2012, it is clear that the slow pace of economic recovery there and weak consumer confidence continues to impact on our visit numbers.</p><p>  In terms of arresting this decline, I welcomed the report of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce (TRT), entitled &quot;GB Path to Growth&quot;, and its recommendations for restoring growth in visitors from Britain which has been reflected in the 2013 plans of the tourism agencies. A copy of the &quot;GB Path to Growth&quot; strategy can be downloaded from the websites of both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.   As part of the strategy, Tourism Ireland is refining its approach to targeting potential visitors that are receptive to the type of experience that Ireland can offer, and is conducting an extensive promotional programme this year in Britain to help ensure that we return to growth in visit numbers.</p><p>  Of course, the major focus of Tourism Ireland's promotions in Britain and other markets this year is on &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot;. An estimated 6 million people throughout Britain claim Irish descent or affiliations to Ireland and these are being targeted through TV, print and online advertising as well as cooperative marketing activities with air and ferry operators featuring the good value fares that are on offer. </p></reply>

The street leagues present a wonderful opportunity for participants to become involved in sport and the possibility of representing Ireland at the Homeless World Cup . I firmly believe that sport can play a very important role in Irish society and the homeless leagues are a very good example of this.</p><p>  The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the allocation of current expenditure funding for sports organisations. The Council channels funding through the National Governing Bodies of Sport. In the case of soccer, funding is provided to the FAI.</p><p>  I am informed by the Irish Sports Council that the homeless street leagues are affiliated to the FAI and that the FAI has been providing financial and other support for the leagues through its Football for All programme since 2006.  The street leagues have been an important programme for the FAI in light of the good work they do on social inclusion in a number of cities and towns around Ireland.</p><p>  I am also informed that the FAI has confirmed that it will provide funding to the Street Leagues again in 2013 but that final figures are not yet agreed.</p></reply>

More than 50 scientific studies were analysed and a huge number of stakeholder groups including flight and cabin crew organisations, airlines, and Member State representatives were consulted by the Agency during the drafting process.  Clearly IALPA had the opportunity during this 3 year consultation period to input their views.The proposed rules contain more than 30 safety improvements compared to current requirements.  While there are elements of the proposed rules that have not been universally well received, the general view among Member States is that the proposal, when viewed as a complete package, represents an improvement on the existing European rules in this area.  The IAA, who represent Ireland's interests in the relevant EU experts committee, also share this view and have explained their position on this issue to IALPA and also to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.</p></reply>

Our Safety at Sea agenda is constantly being developed in line with developments across the maritime sector in terms of internationally recognised safety Conventions, safety standards, Codes of Practice, and the promotion of a culture of safety among those who go to sea for leisure or to earn their living. The importance of ensuring the provision of search and rescue response capability is also vital.</p><p>  Most recently, I have been working with my colleague Simon Coveney TD Minister for Agriculture and the Marine on the development of measures aimed at improving safety at sea for the fishing industry. Our Departments are working together with the relevant Agencies to bring forward proposals for an Enhanced Safety Equipment and Training Scheme for Fishermen. Options on grant-aid of safety equipment,  such as Electronic Position Indicating Radio Beacons, Personal Locator Beacons, are being assessed. Stronger enforcement of safety regulations and more comprehensive safety training requirements in this scheme<b></b>  will deliver a significant positive change in relation to  safety in the fishing sector.</p><p>  However maritime safety concerns are not just confined to the fishing industry. My Department seeks to promote safety on an on-going basis right across the maritime sector. There is a lot of good work going on in this area across Government and also from non-governmental organisations. As part of my consideration on how to enhance Ireland's maritime safety services in general, I am reviewing the need for a Governmental strategy on maritime safety and how such a strategy could be progressed in an integrated way for the  sector.</p><p>  In such a strategy, consideration has to be given to the crucial role of regulation, particularly in relation to vessel inspection and certification, the certification and training of seafarers and the implications of national and international safety standards as they develop over time. These issues have just as critical a role to play in the prevention of accidents and the saving of lives at sea as do campaigns on lifesaving equipment and training.</p><p>  On the issue of working with my Ministerial counterparts in Stormont and Westminster, there is of course co-operation on maritime safety matters between Ministers as such matters arise in North /South and Ireland /UK  Ministerial contexts.</p></reply>

In respect of the future provision of bus services the Programme for Government contains a commitment &ldquo;to establish a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of a more diverse bus service provision&rdquo;.  In line with this commitment the National Transport Authority (NTA) conducted a non-statutory public consultation in summer 2012.  I am aware of the Competition Authority's submission to the public consultation process and the report on the process is available on the NTA's website. This report highlighted that the international experience of tendering for PSO type services has been favourable with benefits accruing in terms of (i) improved service quality, (ii) a more integrated transport system, and (iii) greater value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money. The NTA has also briefed the Cabinet Sub-Committee on the process in October 2012.</p><p>  The public consultation submissions will be considered and taken into account by the NTA in coming forward with proposals.  Where the NTA proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 2008.  Furthermore, the NTA may only enter into a direct award contract &ldquo; where it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts.&quot;  Accordingly the matter will require further examination by the NTA before any decisions are taken.</p><p>  I have been advised by the NTA that it is commencing a series of analytical tasks in relation to the PSO bus market. This analytical work will be completed in advance of August this year when the NTA anticipates statutory consultation on any new direct award contract would need to commence.</p></reply>

Public access to recreational land is one of the issues so identified which requires detailed consideration.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion and no decision has been taken as of yet. I have made my views known on the need to retain and protect mountain bike, cycling and walking trails on Coillte land irrespective of the sale of the harvesting rights.</p></reply>

At the NSMC Plenary meeting on 8th November 2011 Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide &pound;25m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  The Irish Government indicated that it remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole but  that the Government is not in a position to make funding commitments for the period post-2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  </p><p>  The implementation of the A5 project is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities and a decision was made in 2012 to proceed with the construction of two sections between Derry to Strabane and Omagh to Ballybawley. That decision is currently the subject of judicial review proceedings and therefore can not proceed at present.</p></reply>

To this end I facilitated a conference on 3rd December 2012 to which a wide array of industry representatives and wider stakeholder groups were invited in order to discuss how we might set about developing a new national civil aviation policy and to start the debate on what that policy should contain.  </p><p>  Following on from that conference I will shortly publish a consultation paper which has been developed taking into consideration the views expressed at the conference. Submissions and comments by the end of June on the consultation paper will be invited from all stakeholders.  Following this process, I intend to publish a draft Policy Statement later this year for further comment before finalising and adoping the new national policy in early 2014.</p></reply>

I understand that proposals are being progressed to begin the extensive process involved in developing such a comprehensive planning and policy framework.  I and my Department will engage thoroughly with that process, as my Department engaged with the work to establish a National Spatial Strategy, recognising the key interrelationship between spatial planning and travel demand.</p><p>  The current capital programme is determined by the Infrastructure &amp; Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium term Exchequer Framework, published in November 2011 under which investment in capital infrastructure is being scaled back significantly. The revised transport investment plan which replaced Transport 21 and the National Development Plan includes proposals to link the two LUAS lines, invest in new buses, ensure the maintenance, in so far as possible, of the road network and the deferral of projects such as Metro North, DART Underground and the M20 motorway for the time being.</p><p>  Ireland is not in a position to invest in transport at the same levels as before and consequently we need to be shrewd  about how and where we invest. The policy is to prioritise maintenance first, make better use of what we have and then support a very limited number of very good new projects which offer the best prospects for job creation and economic growth.</p><p>  Work has also commenced within my Department to develop a strategic framework for investment in land transport that is expected, in the short to medium term, to underpin the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the land transport element of the Government&rsquo;s Capital Programme 2017 &ndash; 2021, and which over the longer term will provide the framework for decision-making on the appropriate levels and priorities for public expenditure on land transport.</p></reply>

The NESC provides guidance to Government on strategic issues for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development. Since coming into office on 9 March 2011, I have made appointments to the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) as set out in the tables beneath.  The appointments are made in accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and S.I. No. 603 of 2010, National Economic and Social Council (Alteration of Composition) Order 2010.</p><p>I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  I may also appoint up to six public servants of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  These appointments represent relevant Departments to ensure NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making.  I also appointed eight independent members to the NESC in 2011, in most cases from the academic sector.  These appointments were made following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the Council as required by the legislation.</p><p>The Government has put new arrangements in place for the making of appointments to State boards.  In the particular case of the NESC, I should emphasise that most of the members of NESC are appointed on the basis of nominations received from representative organisations.  Historically, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson posts are filled from my Department at Secretary General and Assistant Secretary level.  I am satisfied that the other appointments were appropriate, bearing in mind the key strategic role of the NESC.  However the option of utilising the new process for expressions of public interest will be considered when the next round of appointments of independent members to the NESC arises.</p><p>The only other relevant appointment was that of an   Assistant Secretary from my Department to the National Statistics Board (NSB) on 13 September 2012.  This appointment was made  in line with the provisions of Section 18 (1)(b) of the Statistics Act 1993, which provides for the appointment to the NSB of a representative of my Department at Assistant Secretary or higher grade.  My functions in relation to the NSB were delegated to the Government Chief Whip, Minister of State Paul Kehoe T.D., on 22 March 2011 who therefore made this appointment.</p><p><b>Table 1: Details of appointments made by the Taoiseach to NESC since 9 March 2011 are set out in the table beneath.  </b></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Name </b></div></th><th><div><b>Organisation </b></div></th><th><div><b>Date of </b><br /><b>Appointment </b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Mr. Martin Fraser, Chairperson of NESC</td><td>Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach </td><td><div>August 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Shaw, Deputy Chairperson of NESC</td><td>Assistant Secretary, Department of the Taoiseach </td><td><div>January 2012</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Edgar Morgenroth</td><td>Associate Research Professor, Economic and Social Research Institute </td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. John McHale </td><td>Economist, National University of Ireland, Galway </td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Mary Daly</td><td>Professor of Sociology and Social Policy, Senior Research Fellow of Green Templeton College, Department of Social Policy and Intervention, University of Oxford</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Anna Davis</td><td>Department of Geography, Trinity College Dublin</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prof. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riain</td><td>Department of Sociology, National University of Ireland, Maynooth</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Michael O&#8217;Sullivan</td><td>Head of Portfolio Strategy and Thematic Research, Credit Suisse, London</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Mary Walsh </td><td>Chartered Accountant</td><td><div>June 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Michelle Norris</td><td>Senior Lecturer, School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin.</td><td><div>July 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Shay Cody</td><td>IMPACT</td><td><div>September 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Murphy </td><td>Secretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td><div>November 2011</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; </td><td>Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills</td><td><div>February 2012</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. John Moran</td><td>Secretary General, Department of Finance</td><td><div>March 2012</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The latest CSO Business Demography returns for 2010 were released on 22 June 2012 and the tables below provide data on business start ups and closures from this release.</p><p>The terms used by CSO  are &quot;enterprise births&quot; which refers to new business start ups (companies and other forms of legal ownership), and &quot;enterprise deaths&quot;, which is a business closure. &ldquo;Enterprise births&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enterprise deaths&rdquo; are both dealt with below and can be used for comparison purposes.</p><p>The CSO identifies enterprise births and deaths by using available economic indicators from administrative data (Revenue Commissioner Trading returns in Corporate, Income, Employment and VAT activity). Data for 2011 is not yet available as it is dependent on the receipt of administrative data which are not filed until 2012 and are not fully available to CSO until later in 2013.</p><p>The CSO Business Demography Statistics covers the whole business economy as classified by the standard European classification of economic activity i.e. NACE Rev2 B-N excluding activities of holding companies; K 64.20.</p><p>Table A below contains the relevant data concerning enterprise births for 2007-2010 inclusive.</p><p>Table A: Number of Enterprise Births for 2007-2010 inclusive.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Enterprise Births</div></th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th></tr><tr><td>Business economy excluding activities of holding companies.</td><td>13,461</td><td>11,954</td><td>13,810</td><td>11,237</td></tr></table></p><p>Regarding enterprise deaths, the Deputy should be aware that two types of data are available.

EDP returns are made to EUROSTAT twice a year, at the end of March and the end of October of a given year, in respect of the previous four years.  In March 2013, therefore, GG Debt will be reported for the years from 2009 to 2012, with the 2012 figure being a first estimate.  The Department of Finance will report forecast data for 2013 in this same return.  In addition to the EDP returns, the CSO also reports on GG Debt on a quarterly basis to EUROSTAT under the European System of Accounts (ESA95) transmission programme.  Therefore, the first time the CSO will report on GG Debt for 2013 will be at the end of June 2013, when the Quarterly Government Debt return (Table 2800 of ESA95 transmission programme) for the first quarter of 2013 will be made.  General Government Gross Debt (or Maastricht Debt) is defined as the sum of liabilities of the General Government sector in the categories of Currency &amp; Deposits (AF.2), securities other than shares, excluding derivatives (AF.33) and loans (AF.4).  With regard to the recent announcement in respect of the promissory notes, the immediate impact on the reporting of GG Debt for 2013 will be the reclassification of these particular debt instruments from the category of Long-Term Loans (AF.42) to Long-Term Securities (AF.332).  This reclassification will not impact on the overall GG Debt figure.  The CSO will also report on any changes in the GG Debt which may arise as a result in this change of debt instrument on a quarterly basis under the ESA95 transmission programme and for annual data in the EDP returns.</p></reply>

The Fulbright Commission has a unique status in that it was established pursuant to an international agreement, is funded jointly with the US Government and is therefore not a body solely under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Under the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the USA) Act 1991, the Commission consists of eight members.  The legislation specifies that four of them should be Irish citizens appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and four of them should be citizens of the US and appointed by the US Ambassador.  Vacancies on the board arose in December 2012, November 2012 and May 2011.  These vacancies were publicised on the Department&rsquo;s website and expressions of interest were invited.  The process to nominate the Irish members is at an advanced stage and should be completed shortly.</p><p>  Since taking office, I have made new appointments to two advisory committees, the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee and the Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group.

Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency agenda reflects very closely our domestic priorities.  The opening phase of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the EU is now over.  Our Presidency Programme &ldquo;for Stability, Jobs and Growth&rdquo; has been well received and work is now well under way to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s key Presidency priorities.  The Presidency has actively supported the President of the European Council in securing agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) which is essential to underpin Europe&rsquo;s economic recovery, future growth and social cohesion.  We are engaging intensively with the European Parliament in order to secure its formal assent to the MFF regulation and accompanying Inter-Institutional Agreement.  We will be chairing discussions on almost 70 separate sectoral regulations (including on Common Agricultural Policy reform) related to the MFF proposal and negotiating their passage through the Parliament. </p><p>  One of the most pressing problems in Europe today is high level of unemployment, in particular of young people.  Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency has placed the spotlight on youth unemployment and is taking the necessary measures to secure significant progress on related legislative dossiers such as the youth employment and social investment packages and the youth guarantee file.  We will be seeking to make good progress in this area at the Employment and Social Affairs Council at the end of February.  External trade is also a key driver for jobs and growth.  This is why Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency is focusing substantively on the EU external trade agenda, in particular EU-US relations and with the rapidly growing markets in Asia.  Recent statements by the President of the United States and by EU leaders have given us an additional impetus for working on a mandate necessary for launching negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States.</p><p>  Ireland is seeking to manage the effective implementation of economic governance measures that have been agreed at EU level, in particular the European Semester process of budgetary and economic co-ordination, and the Banking Union proposals.  In order to foster growth and boost job creation across the Union, Ireland is paying special attention to unlocking the potential of the European Single Market and, in particular, of the Digital Agenda.  The Presidency is working to advance proposals on intellectual property, cyber-security, e-Signatures/e-Identification, Data Protection, web accessibility and high-speed broadband roll-out.  Enlargement is also a high priority for our Presidency, seeing this not only as a historical responsibility but also as fundamental for the peace and security of our continent.  The Irish Government is continuously monitoring progress in fulfilling our Presidency Programme.  We have had a good start but there is a lot of work ahead.  During our Presidency, we are strongly committed to achieving tangible results for our citizens.</p></reply>

The Council yesterday adopted comprehensive conclusions which reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s support for international efforts to support stabilisation in Mali and to counter the threat of terrorism.  Recognising that the issues in Mali cannot be addressed by military means alone, Ministers emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and especially the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  In particular, EU Ministers have underlined the preparations for the free and fair elections that are scheduled to take place before the end of July, and the establishment of a National Commission for Dialogue and Reconciliation in Mali.  The Council stressed the importance of international co-ordination on Mali and welcomed the outcomes of the meeting of the Support and Follow-Up Group which took place in Brussels on 5 February, at which the Minister of State for Trade and Development represented Ireland as part of our Presidency of the EU.</p><p>  Following the discussion on the resumption of development assistance to Mali, which took place at the informal meeting of EU Development Ministers in Dublin on 12 February, the Council welcomed the gradual resumption of EU development aid, within the framework of a &quot;State-Building Contract&quot;, linked to implementation of the transition roadmap.  I am particularly concerned at the impact of the crisis on the civilian population of Mali, which was addressed by the Council yesterday, with particular emphasis on the plight of refugees and displaced persons.  The Council also addressed reports of human rights violations in Mali.  The EU's commitment of support for the deployment of human rights monitors in the country is an important development.  In our discussions on Mali, the Council reviewed progress on the deployment of the EU Training Mission in Mali and reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s support for the efforts of the African Union and the regional authorities to put in place the African-led force, AFISMA.  We also discussed the broader regional dimensions of the crisis and underlined the importance of the EU&rsquo;s Sahel Strategy and the appointment of an EU Special Representative for the Sahel.</p></reply>

EU sanctions include a series of individual listings as well as restrictions on goods and services, including an oil and arms embargo.  The Foreign Affairs Council at the end of November renewed the EU sanctions package for a period of three months, allowing a comprehensive review of all applicable sanctions and restrictive measures to take place before they expire at the end of February.  The Foreign Affairs Council on 18 February devoted considerable attention to reviewing the existing sanctions regime and assessing how to further apply pressure against the Syrian authorities given their continuous campaign of repression and violence.  Along with my European colleagues, we had a thorough and comprehensive discussion on the range of options available and how EU sanctions can be used to best effect to further the prospects for a political resolution of the conflict.  I welcome the fact that the Council was able to agree on renewing the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months.  The Council also agreed an amendment to the sanctions regime to allow for the provision of non-lethal support and technical assistance for the protection of civilians.</p></reply>

I believe this conference - and, indeed, the discussion on this topic more generally - will help to highlight the calamitous, unmanageable and immoral implications of any use, whether accidental or deliberate, of nuclear weapons.  It will also help to demonstrate again that the possession of nuclear weapons entails unacceptable risks and that there is no place for these weapons in defensive arsenals or security postures.  The Deputy may be aware that there was discussion of the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament at the 2010 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which expressed its &ldquo;deep concern at the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons" and reaffirmed "the need for all States at all times to comply with applicable international law, including international humanitarian law".</p><p>  When the preparatory process towards the next (2015) NPT Review Conference commenced in Vienna last May, Switzerland sought to generate discussion around this topic with a joint statement on the humanitarian dimension of nuclear disarmament, which it delivered on behalf of 16 states.  It delivered the same statement to the 67th UN General Assembly First Committee meeting in October on behalf of 34 states.  Ireland was involved with both statements from the outset and we are associated by name with them.  I can confirm to the Deputy that Ireland will participate actively in the Oslo Conference.   Last December I was invited by my Norwegian counterpart to nominate Irish representatives at senior official and expert level to participate in the conference.  The Director for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will attend on my behalf.  Our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, which covers disarmament issues, will also be represented.  We are consulting other interested Government Departments to establish how best we might frame a constructive contribution to the discussion in Oslo.  The conference will be preceded by a civil society meeting, organised by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which will debate the same topic.  A contingent of NGOs from the civil society meeting will then participate in the official conference.  I believe civil society has an extremely important role to play in raising awareness about this important issue and contributing to debate.  I hope Irish civil society will be able to feed into the useful and timely discussion that is emerging.  Ireland has an established track record of support for efforts to promote nuclear disarmament.  I assure the Deputy that it is my intention that we will continue to participate actively in these efforts.</p></reply>

This aid is working. Since commencing our work in Uganda in 1994, we have witnessed huge improvements in the quality of life for the Ugandan people. Peace has returned to most of the country after generations of war.  There are now 8.3 million pupils in primary schools compared to 2.5 million 15 years ago. The HIV prevalence rate has been reduced dramatically from 18% in the 1990s to just over 6% today.  Poverty has more than halved over the last two decades. These are real achievements, which have been made possible with the support of donors such as Ireland.    Following the fraud at the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012 which involved the loss of &euro;4 million in Irish Aid funds, the Government suspended all aid provided directly through Ugandan Government systems amounting to &euro;16 million. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government of Uganda has since refunded the &euro;4 million to Ireland.  Ireland has made it clear to the Ugandan Authorities that no Irish Aid support will be channelled directly through Government systems until there has been sufficient follow up to the fraud and until we are satisfied with appropriate assurances from the Ugandan Government around its internal financial systems. We will continue to work with other development partners and directly with the Ugandan Government to assess progress in this regard. </p><p>  An interim development cooperation programme for Uganda in 2013 is under consideration. This will be a smaller programme compared to recent years involving support to programmes managed through non-government partners.  Most of these are a continuation of existing programmes and commitments in education, HIV/AIDS, governance and social protection.  Consideration is also being given to providing direct support to important oversight institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General. Over the course of this year, options will be considered for a longer term strategic approach to the development cooperation programme in Uganda.</p><p>  The Syrian conflict is now almost two years old. In excess of 60,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which has seen the indiscriminate targeting of civilians and residential areas, as well as humanitarian and medical actors. With more than 820,000 individuals having fled the desperate situation in the country, the majority of whom are women and children, neighbouring countries have shown great generosity but also endured great strain in hosting those in need. Ireland has responded promptly and generously, both within Syria and in the neighbouring countries most affected by the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>  As early as March 2012, the Government began providing emergency assistance through partner agencies on the ground, and to date, our total contribution stands at &euro;7.1 million. This includes the recent pledge of &euro;4.7 million made at the High Level Donor Pledging Conference for Syria in Kuwait City on 30 January 2013 attended by Minister of State for Trade and Development, Joe Costello, T.D. Delivered through key UN partners, trusted NGOs and the International Committee of the Red Cross, this support is helping to address the pressing medical and food needs of those requiring life-saving assistance. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution also includes supplies of non-food items from our stocks in Dubai through our Rapid Response Initiative. Into the future we will continue to monitor the situation so that we can review the effectiveness of our contribution and assess how, within our means, we may be able to further respond to humanitarian needs within the region. </p><p>  Holding the Presidency of the European Council, Ireland is striving to build momentum behind international efforts to ease the terrible humanitarian burden faced by the Syrian people, emphasising the need for all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and aid delivery to the people in need, to ensure the neutrality of humanitarian aid and to abide by International Humanitarian Law. Ireland is using the EU Presidency to call on all donors to fulfil pledges made, in coordination with the UN and in full respect of humanitarian principles.</p></reply>

On 22 January, the third anniversary of Haiti&rsquo;s devastating earthquake. It has been reported that police officers forcibly evicted around six hundred families from Camp Place Sainte-Anne in the municipality of Port-au-Prince. Ten days later another eighty-four families were reportedly evicted from Camp Fanm Koperativ. In both cases agencies on the ground say that there was little or no notice of the eviction before their shelters were destroyed.</p><p>  Amnesty International has called on the authorities to stop all illegal and violent evictions of people living in make-shift camps and to take meaningful steps to provide them with appropriate housing. Ireland supports these calls to halt illegal and violent evictions and to identify durable housing solutions for the displaced in Haiti.</p><p>  While over 75% of the 1.5 million Haitians displaced by the earthquake have successfully returned to their homes or have received assistance to relocate, the situation of the 358,000 people still remaining in camps must be addressed in a dignified and sustainable way as a matter of urgency through the identification and provision of durable housing solutions for the displaced people.  the EU-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) Summit of Heads of State and Government that took place last month in Chile, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met with the President of Haiti, H.E. Michel Martelly. They discussed the challenges facing Haiti, with a particular focus on the provision of durable housing for the Internally Displaced population. The T&aacute;naiste was briefed by President Martelly on progress to date, as well as on the Haitian Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to providing those who are still in camps with appropriate housing solutions. </p><p>  The Haiti Humanitarian Action Plan identifies shelter as a top priority requiring assistance of $46 million. Since the earthquake in Haiti over three years ago, Ireland&rsquo;s response to the humanitarian needs has been significant and sustained. In 2010 Ireland pledged funding of &euro;13m for Haiti for the period 2010-2012. This pledge has now been exceeded, and to date, &euro;13.9 million in funding has been disbursed. This funding has focused on the most vulnerable and the most pressing needs, including emergency shelter and reconstruction. The T&aacute;naiste availed of the opportunity of his recent meeting with President Martelly to assure him that Haiti remains a priority for Ireland in terms of humanitarian engagement. It is anticipated that Ireland will provide additional funding to Haiti in 2013 in order to continue our support for the rehabilitation and reconstruction process.</p><p>  The reconstruction and provision of institutional support for Haiti is also a priority for the European Union which to date has provided &euro;213 million in humanitarian assistance to the country, including an additional &euro;  30.5 million allocated in January to help those still homeless as a result of the earthquake, cholera victims and those badly affected by Hurricane Sandy.  The Reconstruction of Haiti is one of the five core areas identified for closer cooperation in the recently adopted Joint Caribbean &ndash; EU Partnership Strategy.</p></reply>

The Presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have declared their intention to form a Eurasian Economic Union by 2015.   The EU endorses regional economic integration processes that are based on voluntary association and that are consistent with WTO commitments.   Russia is the EU's third biggest trade partner, and the EU will continue to work with Russia to advance mutually beneficial economic cooperation.</p><p>  The EU wishes to conclude a New Agreement with Russia that would preferably contain strong trade and investment provisions. It recognises the emerging political reality of the Customs Union although, given the non-WTO membership of Kazakhstan and Belarus, it could only conclude a free trade agreement with the Russian Federation.</p><p>  In common with its EU partners, Ireland sees the value in closer relations between the EU and Ukraine and believes that the conclusion of the EU&rsquo;s Association Agreement with Ukraine will benefit both parties in political and economic terms, and in enhanced people-to-people contacts. However, the EU has stated clearly the areas of concern which Ukraine would need to address convincingly to enable progress to be made towards signature of the Association Agreement. This message will be reiterated at the EU-Ukraine Summit on 25 February.</p><p>  On the specific case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko, this remains a matter of deep concern to Ireland and to its EU partners. I refer the Deputy to my reply to the D&aacute;il on this matter on 16 January. In common with our EU partners, we will continue to monitor developments in regard to this case. The EU has continually impressed on the Ukrainian authorities that progress towards the signature and ratification of the EU&rsquo;s Association Agreement with Ukraine would require it to address, among other issues, the question of politically motivated convictions  . The Conclusions adopted by EU Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council last December called on Ukraine to demonstrate &lsquo;determined action and tangible progress&rsquo; in three areas of concern, including that of selective justice.

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, and the Honorary Consul of Ireland Office in Colombo have also been very active in this difficult case.     </p><p>  The person named by the Deputy has been detained in Sri Lanka since 5 September 2007.  No charge was brought against him until 29 January 2013.  I am informed that at his trial on that date a sentence of one month was imposed on him. Subsequently, he was informed that he would be released on Tuesday, 12 February 2013. Based on this information his family made flight arrangements for him to return to Ireland.  Officials from the Honorary Consulate attended the prison on 12 February to be present on his release and to offer any possible consular assistance.  They were informed that the release would not go ahead and that 4 charges would be brought him.</p><p>  I am personally very concerned about this latest development and especially by the sudden manner by which his release was revoked. I have written to the Minister for External Affairs expressing in the strongest possible terms my disappointment and concern at the latest developments in this case and asking that the Minister act to ensure that all possible due process of law is afforded to the person named by the Deputy. Arrangements have been made for our Ambassador in New Delhi to travel to Sri Lanka next Wednesday, 20 February in order that he may pay a prison visit to him. The Ambassador also requested a meeting with the Sri Lankan Minister for External Affairs and he will personally deliver my letter to the Minister.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that all possible consular assistance will continue to be provided in this very difficult case and that my officials will continue to liaise with the family of the person named by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Civil society organisations play an important role in bringing citizens together to act collectively and participate in the development of their own countries and communities. They have a strong role to play in demanding better services from the state and holding governments to account.</p><p>  In some developing countries, civil society organisations have come under increasing pressure in recent years as they seek to play their legitimate role in society.  In these countries, dialogue with civil society organisations is limited and the space for civil society engagement remains narrow or is, in some cases, shrinking. This can severely limit the operations and effectiveness of organisations, notably those working on human rights and advocacy.</p><p>  Ireland has a long tradition of supporting civil society engagement.  Through the Government&#8217;s aid programme, we work to protect the space in which civil society organisations operate, and to foster an enabling environment for the work.  We channel a higher proportion of our development assistance through civil society organisations than other international donors.  Of Ireland&#8217;s total aid budget of &#8364;623 million this year, about a quarter will be channelled through civil society organisations to support their valuable work in, for example, improving access to health care and education, supporting livelihoods, and strengthening accountability, governance and democracy.  Tr&oacute;caire and a number of other organisations, such as, Christian Aid and Frontline Defenders, is specifically funded by my Department to promote and facilitate strong civil society engagement across a range of countries.</p><p>  In Ireland&#8217;s nine partner countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, we also provide funding to local civil society organisations.  This enables their participation at local and national levels of decision-making and their work for the fulfilment of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable.  Ireland&#8217;s partnerships in these countries are founded on respect for human rights, and we will continue to emphasise in our dialogue with partner governments that it is essential to ensure the role of civil society organisations is enhanced.</p><p>  Internationally, we have agreed, by signing up to the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, to implement fully our commitments to enable civil society organisations to exercise their role as independent development actors.  At the meeting of Development Ministers under the EU Foreign Affairs Council, which I attended in Luxembourg in October last, I gave strong support to new Conclusions on Europe's engagement with civil society.  These commit Member States &#8220;to support and promote an enabling environment for an independent, pluralistic and active civil society in partner countries&#8221;<i>.  </i></p><p>  The EU will work to improve our dialogue with civil society organisations on the ground, and to continue close monitoring of legislation, regulations and other restrictions on the operation of civil society organisations in our partner countries.</p><p>  Ireland&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council presents a valuable opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the promotion and protection of an enabling environment for civil society.  We intend to advance this issue during our term on the Council, building on a successful meeting on consolidating the space for civil society which Ireland organised during the September 2012 Human Rights Council session.  Ireland is also championing the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism which reviews all member states&#8217; human rights records, including the treatment of civil society actors and human rights defenders.</p><p>  The Government will continue to promote civil society-led initiatives and to support other arrangements at national and international level to promote and monitor an enabling environment for civil society organisations.</p></reply>

This is an important clause which has been included at the EU&rsquo;s insistence in all the Association Agreements with neighbouring states.  It puts human rights clearly on the table as a matter for mutual concern and discussion.  This obviates the argument of many states that human rights are a purely domestic issue and establishes the EU&rsquo;s right to raise these issues in the structures established by the Association Agreement for that purpose. </p><p>  It is the EU which has sought to formalise relations with its neighbours in the form of these Agreements.  The Agreements themselves make plain that human rights concerns are understood to exist in relation to Association partners and it provides for dialogue to address these.   Such dialogue on human rights issues is actively pursued within the current structures of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.  No EU member State, including Ireland, has considered that the existence of unresolved human rights problems in itself makes the Agreement invalid.  If this were the case, then probably all of the Association Agreements, which the EU has painstakingly put in place, would have to be abandoned.</p><p>  There is no provision in the EU-Israel Association Agreement for its suspension.  Instead, the Agreement provides for disagreements over its implementation to be raised at the annual Association Council.  There would be no support whatever at EU level for the suspension or cancellation of this Agreement.</p></reply>

At the same time, the UK also makes a valued contribution to our Union. The EU is, without a doubt, stronger for having the UK as a Member State and I believe that the UK would continue to be better served as a member of the EU rather than opting-out.</p><p>  Nationally, our excellent bilateral relations with the UK are reflected in our close working relationship with them in an EU context, not least on the range of issues on which we are like-minded, such as exploring the considerable opportunities presented by the Single Market and the EU&rsquo;s ambitious trade agenda.</p></reply>

It has played an important role in recording the history of Northern Ireland and the peace process which will be of ongoing value to historians and the study of conflict resolution. In March 2011 the British Government, acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, initiated proceedings with the US Department of Justice under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries for the release of archived interviews held in Boston College. The archives are part of the <i>Belfast Project,</i> an oral history of Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries compiled by Mr McIntyre and Mr Moloney and deposited in the   . Some of those whose testimony is included in the project have since died, including Dolores Price who passed away in recent months.</p><p>  Legal challenges were launched by Boston College, and separately by Mr MacIntyre and Mr Moloney, to prevent the release of the material.  In December 2011, these challenges were dismissed by US District Court Judge William Young<i>. </i>  Further legal efforts by Mr MacIntyre and Mr Moloney were made but on 6 July, the US Federal Court of Appeal turned down their appeal. </p><p>  The court ruling means that the archived material must be handed over by Boston College to the US authorities for onward transmission to their British counterparts. However Mr Moloney and Mr McIntyre are considering a motion for a re-hearing of the case. They also continue to keep their legal options open in the Belfast Courts.</p><p>  Officials of my Department will continue to closely monitor any further developments.</p></reply>

A resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants will continue to be an important priority for the Government in our ongoing contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  This issue will remain a central feature of the Government&rsquo;s engagement with the US authorities over the St Patrick&rsquo;s day period, and my programme and that of other members of the Government, while not yet finalised, will include meetings with key political figures and the Irish community groups that provide assistance to the undocumented.  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.  The prospects for such reform have advanced in the wake of President Obama&rsquo;s re-election.  The emphasis he placed on immigration reform in his inauguration address as well as in subsequent speeches, including the State of the Union address, sent a very positive signal in this regard.  The indications of emerging bipartisan support for reform in Congress is also encouraging.  Much further debate and discussion is likely to be required within the US political system before the shape of any legislative deal is clear.

The visit opened with a plenary meeting between the Government and the College which confirmed a high level of support for the Presidency priorities of Stability, Jobs and Growth, and for the specific measures we are advancing to realise those objectives. </p><p>  At the meeting I spoke about the urgent need for action by the EU on tackling youth unemployment and the priorities set out in the Irish Presidency programme to address the issue including the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee, improved skills and training and removing barriers to worker mobility. I also highlighted the prospects for job creation in policy areas such as the Single Market, Digital Single Market and the research and innovation sector which the Irish Presidency is prioritising.  As Chairman of the General Affairs Council I spoke about the urgent need to reach a decision of an adequately funded budget for the EU from 2014-2020 (Multiannual Financial Framework/MFF) to underpin economic recovery and job creation.  I also outlined the Presidency&rsquo;s objectives in relation to the PEACE programme, developing new markets for the EU&rsquo;s exporters through enhanced foreign trade agreements.  I highlighted the issue of EU-US Trade at that time and we are very satisfied to now see that work underway.</p><p>  On the external relations agenda facing the Union I undertook to give full support to the work of HRVP Ashton and indicated that the Irish Presidency priorities would include human rights, development aid and enlargement.</p><p>  Following the plenary, Ministers met with their Commission counterparts in a number of smaller thematic meetings to review and discuss policy aspects of the Irish Presidency programme in greater detail. As chair of the General Affairs Council I met with Commissioners Almunia, Rehn, Lewandowski. &Scaron;efčovič, and Hahn with Ministers Noonan   and Howlin. The issues discussed included the need for a timely deal on the MFF, to allow the Irish Presidency to seek agreement on the range of programmes of the Union that will create stability and drive growth and job creation in Europe for the remainder of the decade.  We also exchanged views on the related issue of cohesion funding.  We discussed the Presidency&rsquo;s objectives in relation to the Banking Union and the agenda of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council and the broader Presidency growth agenda.</p></reply>

The work undertaken by Desmond De Silva QC can facilitate this, in my opinion, by helping ensure that an independent public inquiry need not be lengthy, open-ended and inordinately expensive. As I said at the time, we must build on the progress made thus far.</p><p>  I did not attend the EU Heads of State and Government Summit in December 2012, however, in my contacts with Secretary of State Villiers following the publication, I made clear that the Irish Government will continue to seek an independent public inquiry.

Ireland has been particularly to the fore in focussing attention on this issue and in pressing for stronger EU and international action on it.   I have consistently stressed the importance I attach to this matter, both here in the House and at EU level.</p><p>  The December Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on the Middle East which included the following statement on settlements:<blockquote>  &#8220;The European Union is deeply dismayed by and strongly opposes Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank, including in East Jerusalem, and in particular plans to develop the E1 area. The E1 plan, if implemented, would seriously undermine the prospects of a negotiated resolution of the conflict by jeopardizing the possibility of a contiguous and viable Palestinian state and of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states. It could also entail forced transfer of civilian population. In the light of its core objective of achieving the two-state solution, the EU will closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and act accordingly. The European Union reiterates that settlements are illegal under international law and constitute an obstacle to peace.&#8221;</blockquote>  The focus of discussion at this week&#8217;s meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council was on the overall political process, particularly following the re-election of President Obama, the appointment of the new US Secretary of State, John Kerry, and the recent Israeli election.  I discussed with my colleagues the prospects for restarting the negotiations track, and in particular how we might encourage the new US team to give a priority to making progress on the MEPP.</p></reply>

The Commissioners' &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot;, which is published on the Revenue website (<i>www.revenue.ie</i>), includes a wide range of measures designed to target those engaged in the supply and sale of illicit tobacco products and very significant resources will be devoted to this issue in 2013.  This multi-faceted strategy includes:</p><p>- the ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem,</p><p>- developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis,</p><p>- the ongoing review of operational policies by a high-level group within Revenue that is chaired by one of the Commissioners personally,</p><p>- the development of analytics and detection technologies, and</p><p>- the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>As regards Dublin city centre, Revenue actively monitors the illegal tobacco trade and has identified certain areas as particular black spots for the sale of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue is currently engaged in an ongoing range of measures targeting those involved.  Officers routinely conduct high visibility patrols aimed at disrupting the sale and supply of tobacco products in areas in question.<i> </i> In November 2012, Revenue increased the number of patrols in the areas concerned.  Revenue's presence in these areas has also been bolstered by the deployment of both the tobacco dog unit and marked vehicles during certain targeted operations.  In 2012, 5 cases were referred for prosecution in relation to illegal trading in tobacco products in the city centre.  Revenue expects a number of further prosecutions for such cases to come before the courts in 2013.  Moreover, in tandem with ongoing high visibility patrols of the area, Revenue personnel are actively engaged in covert surveillance and test purchasing for the purpose of gathering intelligence with a view to identifying and prosecuting the suppliers of illicit tobacco products in the areas concerned.</p><p>At a national level, interception of illicit tobacco products is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally.  There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The relevant agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organized crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p><p>Considerable success has been achieved by Revenue in combating the illegal trade.  Details of the quantities of cigarettes seized each year since 2005 are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Quantity of cigarettes seized (millions)</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>51.3</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>52.3</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>135.2</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>218.5</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>178.4</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>109.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>95.6</td></tr></table></p><p>The quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures.  For example, the quantity of cigarettes seized in 2009 includes one exceptional seizure of some 120 million cigarettes that were uncovered on a vessel at Greenore, Co. Louth.</p><p>Moreover, the Revenue Commissioners have had considerable success in detecting and prosecuting persons involved in the illicit trade.  For example, in 2012, there were 57 convictions for tobacco smuggling, resulting in 26 custodial sentences being handed down by the Courts (of which 7 were suspended) as well as fines totalling &euro;93,550.  In addition, there were a further 75 convictions connected with the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in 21 custodial sentences (14 of which were suspended) as well as fines of &euro;153,050.</p><p>Revenue is committed to ensuring that the highest possible levels of seizures of illicit products are achieved on an ongoing basis, and that those responsible for the smuggling, supply or selling of illicit products are prosecuted, and will ensure that this work continues to have the high priority that has been accorded to it to date.</p></reply>

"Special housing needs" refers to the provision of housing and support for people who have a particular need in addition to a general housing need to enable them to live in the community.  In relation to senior citizens' complexes, a local authority would qualify for an exemption from LPT, if it was providing some necessary support to these senior citizens in addition to the housing accommodation.  Supports, in this context, would include, for example, an on-site warden or support staff, on site communal facilities such as catering kitchen for preparing group meals, dining and recreation areas, laundry and alarm system.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013, published on 13 February 2013, provides that, where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, for the first valuation period (up to the end of 2016) the market value of each of these properties will be deemed to be &euro;100,000 or less, which represents a LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013.  It will be a matter for the local authorities themselves whether they will pass on the LPT liability to their tenants in the form of an increase in rent or whether they will absorb the liability without recourse to their tenants.  The Bill also provides that local authorities' LPT liability for 2013 shall be payable with their 2014 liability.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are liaising with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to establish how local authorities will provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in relation to their LPT liability and the timing and manner of the payment of this liability. </p></reply>

VAT legislation in Ireland in relation to property disposals is in compliance with the VAT Directive and applies equally to local authorities and any other person dealing in property.

Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion last year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  Both banks have achieved their 2011 and 2012 targets. </p><p>  The pillar banks are expected to lend to viable businesses in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel sector, and to address the needs of SMEs in financial difficulty.  The Credit Review Office is available to assist businesses which have been refused credit.  The withdrawal of a particular bank from this country is regrettable because it reduces competition in the provision of credit to the economy.  However, in  his most recent quarterly report, the Credit Reviewer stated that </p><p>  &quot;I have observed no geographic region or trade sector being relatively adversely affected by this contraction in these two banks.  This may be due to restructuring their own legacy books and refinancing other banks&rsquo; lending as the Central Bank reports show contraction in drawdowns in some sectors such as hospitality and retail.&quot;</p><p>  The Credit Review Office is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and anyone who has been refused credit by the banks should avail of the services of the Office. </p><p>  Last month, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) announced investment commitments in a suite of three new long-term funds which will provide equity, credit and restructuring / recovery investment for Irish SMEs and mid-sized corporates.  The NPRF is also currently reviewing additional SME funding opportunities that would complement these commitments, with the objective that the eventual suite of funds would have the capacity to invest across the full spectrum of SME financing needs. The NPRF specifically stated that its SME Credit Fund may acquire and refinance loans close to maturity where existing lenders are not willing to provide new lines of credit.</p></reply>

Eligible deposits of up to &euro;100,000 for an individual and &euro;200,000 for individuals with a joint account in IBRC are protected by the DGS.  Eligible deposits above this limit are guaranteed under the ELG.  The majority of the deposits in IBRC are covered under one or both of these schemes.</p><p>  I am advised by the CBI that certain tracker bonds sold to Credit Unions which were liabilities of IBRC at the time of the liquidation have a structured deposit element which is covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme for that element of the product.  As a result the first &euro;100k of any claim from these depositors is covered under the DGS Scheme.  I have been advised that the Liquidator is aware of a number of depositors who fall outside the eligibility criteria for the ELG Scheme due to the nature of the investment product.

At this early stage of the special liquidation the Special Liquidators are engaged in intensive processes which involve inter alia, asserting control over the businesses, processes, systems and personnel of IBRC.  It is important that focus is placed on assessing, reorganising and restructuring the day&ndash;to-day activities of the Bank to meet the primary objective of ensuring the purpose of the special liquidation is achieved, as this is key to ensuring that maximum value is extracted from the liquidation.

A special Government Sub-Committee is already in place since March last year to address the mortgage arrears problem.  This Committee is chaired by An Taoiseach and includes all other relevant Ministers, and reflects the need for accelerated progress in this area.  At official level, my Department is taking a lead role and in that context, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department's Secretary General, was established to drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the 'Keane Report').  </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Personal Insolvency Act is now in place and considerable work is now underway to shortly launch the Insolvency Service and to bring into operation the new insolvency frameworks provided for in that Act.  This is a priority for Government and it is also receiving continuous and high level attention at the official high level Steering Group.</p><p>  Aside from the formal legislative insolvency reforms, the Central Bank, under its MARS project, is also continuing to work intensively with lenders to ensure that they had robust mortgage strategies including a range of longer term options as recommended by the Keane Report, such as 'trade-down mortgages', 'split mortgages' and 'sale by agreement' or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders.  The focus of this work is now intensifying and will be on the implementation of these strategies, in particular on the delivery of durable restructuring arrangement to appropriate borrowers, and ensuring that banks have the operational capability to implement them effectively.  The Deputy may also be aware of Governor Honohan's recent comments at the Central Bank&rsquo;s Conference on 'How to Fix Distressed Property Markets' in which he said that the banks are much better staffed and organised for dealing with arrears, and that the Central Bank will be setting out its quantitative expectations for their effectiveness in achieving lasting solutions.</p><p>  In addition, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) remains a key framework to govern the relationship between mortgage holders experiencing difficulty and their bank.  The Central Bank has commenced a review of the Code and will shortly open a public consultation process on the review.  The CCMA requires updating at this time due to the introduction of both the Personal Insolvency legislation and longer term mortgage resolution options.  The review will also take into consideration recent developments that may be relevant to the issue of mortgage arrears and clarifications issued by the Central Bank since the current version was issued.  </p><p>  I wish to repeat that the Government is committed to intensifying its efforts to address the mortgage arrears problem and ensuring that both lenders and borrowers work together to deliver sustainable outcomes that is as fair as possible to all parties and respects the rights of both debtors and creditors. </p></reply>

However, I can confirm to the Deputy that due consideration was given, in preparatory work on the liquidation of IBRC and the legislation passed earlier this month, to ensuring the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential can be worked through in the medium term by NAMA rather than sold at any price. The Government&rsquo;s approach in this area is consistent and focused on the best outcome.   </p><p>  Regarding the valuation process, at this stage of the special liquidation the liquidators are engaged in intensive processes which involve inter alia, asserting control over the businesses, processes, systems and personnel of IBRC. It is important that focus is placed on assessing, reorganising and restructuring the day&ndash;to-day activities of the Bank to meet the primary objective of ensuring the purpose of the special liquidation is achieved, as this is key to ensuring that value is extracted from the liquidation.</p></reply>

The Personal Insolvency Act amends existing bankruptcy law and also introduces new frameworks for the formal consideration and possible settlement of unsustainable debt situations, including the Personal Insolvency Arrangement which will deal with secured debt, outside of formal bankruptcy.  As such a debtor will be in a position to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to address unsustainable mortgage debt, irrespective of the particular type of mortgage.  However, strict eligibility criteria will apply before a debtor can make such a proposal to his/her creditors, including that the debtor is regarded as being insolvent.  As such, a Personal Insolvency Arrangement will not be a vehicle to solely address a mortgage shortfall arising from the maturity of an endowment policy unless the debtor is overall in a position of insolvency.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of endowment mortgages more generally, I have been informed by the Central Bank that where the proceeds of an endowment policy are insufficient to repay the capital element of an endowment mortgage, borrowers need ample time to make alternative repayment arrangements. In addition, borrowers are afforded the protections of the &rsquo;Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears&rsquo; in cases where the mortgage is in arrears or in pre-arrears and is secured by the borrower&rsquo;s primary residence. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that, when the risks associated with endowment mortgage products were highlighted in the 1990s, specific provisions were incorporated into the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which require warnings to the effect that the proceeds of a policy may not be sufficient to repay a mortgage. Under the provisions of the Act, endowment mortgage savings plans must be reviewed by the life company at least every five years to check if the plan is on track to repay the mortgage. In this regard, a statement setting out the estimated revised valuation of the endowment policy at maturity must be issued by the insurer to the borrower. If the policy is not on track to repay the mortgage, the life company will recommend an increase in the premium.</p></reply>

The site allows for searches by both property type and country/area.  In each instance, information about the firm dealing with the insolvency and its contact details are provided.

Confidential information is specifically defined to include information relating to debtors. Furthermore, Section 99 of the Act provides that, on acquisition of a loan, NAMA takes over the obligations of the participating institution under the loan, one of which is the contractual duty of confidentiality which the debtor enjoyed while still a customer of the participating institution. Information about individual debtors or guarantors is also protected against disclosure by the Data Protection Acts with which NAMA must comply as a data controller. </p><p>  However, in cases where NAMA receives enquiries from potential purchasers about specific properties under the control of debtors, it can facilitate contact with a view to enabling sales transactions to take place.  </p><p>  NAMA advises that the strategy for individual properties, including for instance whether a debtor should arrange for early sale of a property or hold it with a view to generating on-going cash flow, is determined on a case-by-case basis. Individual asset strategy is guided by cost-benefit analysis and by the objective of obtaining maximum return for the taxpayer.</p></reply>

As such, the information in tabular form which the Deputy is seeking is not available from my Department. The role of these measures is to encourage and assist employers in their own efforts and to provide them with practical help.  Examples of such measures would include VAT.</p><p>  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provided for a second reduced VAT rate, of 9%, on a temporary basis in respect of certain tourism-related services and goods for the period 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2013.  This was announced in the Jobs Initiative on 10 May 2011.  In reducing the VAT burden on activities related to the tourism industry, the introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  The measure was estimated to cost &#8364;120m in 2011, &#8364;350 in 2012, &#8364;350 in 2013, and &#8364;60 in 2014 and nil thereafter.</p><p><i>Reduction in Employer&#8217;s PRSI</i></p><p>  In the Jobs Initiative, the lower rate of PRSI payable by employers was halved until end-2013.  This applied to lower income jobs that pay up to &#8364;356 per week.</p><p><i>R&amp;D Tax Credit</i></p><p>  The Research and Development (&#8216;R&amp;D&#8217;) tax regime allows a tax credit of 25% on incremental R&amp;D expenditure in addition to the normal 12.5% trading deduction.  The scheme provides for expenditure on R&amp;D that is in excess of that undertaken in the base year of 2003 to qualify for the credit.  The regime has been improved in a number of ways in Finance Act 2012 and further amendments are proposed in Finance Bill 2013.</p><p><i>Special Assignee Relief Programme (&#8216;SARP&#8217;)</i></p><p>  The SARP was introduced in Finance Act 2012 and is designed to reduce the cost to employers of assigning key individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of their employer. This relief is targeted at individuals who are highly skilled and whose placement in Ireland could lead to additional employment in new divisions or sections of the company in which they are employed.</p><p><i>Foreign Earnings Deduction (&#8216;FED&#8217;)</i></p><p>  The FED was introduced in Finance Act 2012 to assist companies seeking to expand into emerging markets. The scheme provides a deduction from income for income tax purposes for work related travel to certain countries. Additional exports from such companies could lead to employment creation.</p><p><i>Employment and Investment Incentive</i></p><p>  EII is a tax incentive which provides income tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades. Relief is initially available to an individual at 30%, with a further 11% tax relief available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the holding period or that the company spent a certain proportion of the monies raised on Research and Development. An extension of the EII for a further 7 years from 2014-2020 was announced in Budget 2013. In addition, hotels, guesthouses and self catering accommodation where they meet the conditions of the incentive will be allowed qualify on a temporary basis, to be reviewed after a period of two years</p><p><i>3 Year Tax Exemption for Start-up Companies</i></p><p>  This scheme provides relief from CT on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies in the first 3 years of trading.  It was introduced in FA (No.2) 2008 and applied to the extent that the CT liability did not extend beyond &#8364;40,000.</p><p>  It has been amended and extended in Finance Act 2012 and further amendments are proposed in Finance Bill 2013</p><p><i>Taxation of International Financial Services</i></p><p>  In order to retain competitiveness, <b>Finance Act 2012</b>   introduced a package of low-cost measures to support the continued success of the International Financial Services industry.  The measures focused on improving double tax relief and reducing administrative burden.  Finance Bill 2013 also contains a small number of measures to improve the competitiveness of the IFSC and assist in maintaining and growing employment in the sector.</p><p><i>Renewable energy generation</i></p><p>  Finance Act 2012  extended the qualifying period for the scheme of tax relief for corporate investment in certain renewable energy projects from 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage investment in renewable energy projects and to facilitate the growth of electricity generation capacity using these sources.  It applies to the following categories of technology: Solar, Wind, Hydro (including ocean, wave or tidal energy), and Biomass.</p><p><i>Energy-efficient equipment</i></p><p>  Finance Bill 2012  also extended the scheme of accelerated capital allowances for expenditure by companies on certain energy-efficient equipment for a further 3 years to end-2014.</p><p><i>Cut in commercial Stamp Duty</i></p><p>  Finance Bill 2012  abolished multiple Stamp Duty rates for non-residential properties, and brought in a single rate of 2% in respect of instruments executed after 6 December 2011.  </p><p><i>Real Estate Investment Trusts </i></p><p>  As announced in the Budget, Finance Bill 2013 will provide a new tax regime to allow for the introduction of <b>Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)</b>   companies in Ireland.  REITs are an internationally recognised format for collective investment in rental property.  It is hoped that REITs will facilitate the attraction of foreign investment capital to the Irish property market, helping to stabilise that market, and also releasing bank financing from the property market for use by other sectors of the economy.  REITs also provide investors with an alternative lower-cost, lower-risk method for property investment.</p><p><i>Finance Bill 2013 - Other Corporation Tax measures</i></p><p>  In addition, the Finance Bill contained further enhancements to the &#8216;Key Employee&#8217; provision of the R&amp;D Tax Credit and the Intangible Asset regime.</p><p><i>The Seed Capital Scheme (SCS)</i></p><p>  An extension of the SCS for a further 7 years from 2014-2020 was also announced in Budget 2013. This scheme provides that an employee, who leaves employment and invests by means of shares in a qualifying new venture, may claim a refund of income tax paid in previous years. An unemployed person may also avail of this facility. </p><p>  I would add also that, conscious of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations, a variety of measures have been introduced by me in recent Finance Bills to assist Revenue in counteracting shadow economy activity.</p></reply>

However, given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how in practice such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.</p><p>  This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2010, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

This approach has been very successful to date, as witnessed in the developments earlier this month, and by meeting our commitments and engaging in constructive dialogue with our European partners we expect further results in the future.   </p><p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) and ECB provide funding to Irish banks under various arrangements.

Funding via exceptional liquidity assistance (ELA) was provided to IBRC by the CBI with the express knowledge of the ECB.</p><p>  However, from both the CBI and ECB&rsquo;s viewpoint the use of ELA for long term funding was problematic.

The EIB is owned by the EU Member States who subscribe to the Bank's capital. As shareholders, the Member States are represented on the Bank's main independent decision-making bodies, the Board of Governors and the Board of Directors. The overall objective of the Bank is to contribute towards the integration, balanced development and economic and social cohesion of the EU Member States.    </p><p>  The EIB has four statutory bodies; three decision making bodies: the Board of Governors, the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, and one control body: the Audit Committee. </p><p>  The Board of Governors comprises Ministers designated by each of the 27 Member States, usually Finance Ministers. It lays down credit policy guidelines, approves the annual accounts and balance sheet, and decides on the Bank&rsquo;s participation in financing operations outside the European Union as well as on capital increases. It also appoints the members of the Board of Directors, the Management Committee and the Audit Committee. I am currently Ireland&rsquo;s representative on the Board of Governors. </p><p>  The Board of Directors consists of 28 Directors, with one Director nominated by each Member State and one by the European Commission. There are 18 Alternates, meaning that some of these positions are shared by groupings of States.</p><p>  The Board of Directors has sole power to take decisions in respect of loans, guarantees and borrowings. As well as seeing that the Bank is properly run, it ensures that the Bank is managed in keeping with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute and with the general directives laid down by the Governors. Its members are appointed by the Governors for a renewable period of five years following nomination by the Member States and are responsible solely to the Bank. Ireland&rsquo;s representative on the Board of Directors is currently Dr. Michael Somers.</p><p>  I assume that the Deputy is referring to Ireland&rsquo;s representative on the Board of Directors in her question. Decisions are adopted by that body when a majority consisting of at least one third of the members entitled to vote, including the Director nominated by the Commission, and a majority of at least 50% of the subscribed capital have voted in favour of a decision. In specific cases, a qualified majority is required with at least eighteen votes in favour, representing a minimum of 68% of the subscribed capital. </p><p>  There has been continued close engagement with the EIB since President Werner Hoyer&rsquo;s visit last July when he met with the Taoiseach as well as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself. This visit led to the establishment of a Joint High Level Working Group between my Department and the EIB to enable close collaboration on projects aimed at expanding the Irish economy and supporting growth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-19a.442.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900077#WRJ03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 to 272, inclusive, together.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in common with all of Ireland&#8217;s agreements for the avoidance of double taxation, the Ireland &#8211; Zambia Double Taxation Convention contains a provision which allows the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to consult with each other under what is called the &#8220;mutual agreement procedure&#8221; when there are any doubts or difficulties in relation to the application or interpretation of the treaty.  The relevant provision of the Ireland &#8211; Zambia Convention is Article XXI. While the Irish Revenue Commissioners cannot comment in relation to any specific case, they have informed me that the Zambian tax authorities have not expressed any concerns in relation to the application or interpretation of the Convention.</p><p>  The Ireland - Zambia Convention sets out the &#8220;arm&#8217;s length principle&#8221;, which requires profits arising between connected parties, i.e. which involve the uses of transfer prices, to be computed in the same amount as would arise on foot of transactions between independent parties. This principle has continued to be an unchanging feature of the OECD and UN Model Double Taxation Conventions  .  It is not apparent, therefore, that there is any basis for linking concerns in relation to transfer pricing with the provisions of this Convention.</p><p>  Specific transfer pricing legislation was enacted by Finance Act, 2010 and is contained in Part 35A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  These provisions set out the rules that govern the application of the arm's length principle, mentioned above.  The arm&#8217;s length principle and the related transfer pricing provisions must be applied to adjust any understatement of profit that would otherwise arise, so that the full arm&#8217;s length profit is taxed in Ireland.  Companies within the scope of the Part 35A provisions must meet documentation requirements and have such documentation available to Revenue to demonstrate compliance with the legislation.  The first corporation tax returns to which the legislation applied were for accounting periods ending on 31 December 2011 and these returns were received in September 2012. </p><p>  In addition to the provisions mentioned above, the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 33 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 set out requirements to provide the Revenue Commissioners with information in respect of <i>disclosable transactions. </i>These are<i></i>  specified types of transactions one of the main purposes of which would be to provide a tax advantage. As with the tax codes of other countries, where anti-avoidance and disclosure provisions are intended to protect the domestic tax base, the provisions of Part 35A and Chapter 3 of Part 33 are intended to protect the Irish tax base. </p><p>  Assistance to other countries in addressing suspected avoidance or evasion is provided internationally by exchange of information.  All of Ireland&#8217;s double taxation agreements &#8211; including that with Zambia &#8211; contain provisions for the exchange, between the tax authorities, of information necessary to give effect to the agreement and to the domestic tax law of the Contracting States.  Ireland has also negotiated over 20 Tax Information Exchange Agreements &#8211; implementing the OECD standard on exchange of information - with countries with which we do not have a double taxation agreement. </p><p>  In addition, Ireland has signed up to the joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.  In response to a call from the G20 in 2009 &#8220;to make it easier for developing countries to secure the benefits of the new co-operative tax environment&#8221;, a Protocol was developed to amend this Convention to open it up to all countries.  Ireland signed the Convention and the Protocol in June 2011. My Department also supports initiatives such as the OECD&#8217;s Tax and Development Programme and works with Irish Aid in this regard.</p></reply>

A key element of the restructuring of the Promissory Notes was the liquidation of IBRC. The disappearance of the former Anglo Irish Bank and former Irish Nationwide Building Society from our financial, political and social landscape was long overdue. They became emblems of a culture of cronyism that undermined the confidence in both our economy and our political system.  They became a stain on our international reputation and dent to our national pride.  There are numerous benefits from the arrangement that have been undertaken.  There are efficiency gains from housing &lsquo;legacy assets&rsquo; in a single vehicle, NAMA.  Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short term borrowings has also been removed from the Irish banking landscape.  There is also an expected reduction in the underlying deficit by c.&euro;1 billion per annum over the coming years with a reduction in government debt over time.</p><p>  The Special Liquidation Order, made under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act 2013, is no different from other liquidations and for employees in IBRC their employment was terminated with immediate effect following the passing of the Act on Thursday 7th February.  There is no doubt that this will have come as a shock to the employees in the bank.  It is unfortunate that it was not possible to give more notice on this matter and I regret the abruptness of how this decision was communicated to the management and staff.  However it was imperative to keep the matter confidential due to the scale, sensitivity and complexity of the economic issues involved.  As previously stated I want to acknowledge, with much appreciation, the significant efforts the directors and staff of IBRC have made to the stabilisation of, and maintenance of value in, IBRC.  Nonetheless, unlike in other liquidations many of the employees have been be re-hired by the Special Liquidator, some of whom will be employed for the duration of the liquidation on such terms as he may determine.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators have confirmed to IBRC staff that there will be no termination of contracts within the first 3 months of the liquidation.  Some staff may be offered positions with NAMA or with other purchasers of the assets, to continue to manage the loan portfolios. </p></reply>

It is too early in the process to speculate on the potential financial outcome of the liquidation process, however I can confirm that due consideration was given, in preparatory work on the liquidation of IBRC and the legislation passed earlier this month, to ensuring the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  As part of the role of the liquidators, the assets of IBRC will be valued independently before being sold.  Any assets not sold to third parties (including loan counterparties and other financial institutions) at or above the valuation price will be sold to NAMA at the independent valuation.  This ensures a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; price on the assets of IBRC and that where required, assets with limited sale potential can be worked through in the medium term by NAMA rather than sold at any price.  The Government&rsquo;s approach in this area is consistent and focused on the best outcome.</p></reply>

A response is then prepared and issued.  The Revenue Commissioners are very mindful of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations.  Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects.  A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as prearranged aspect queries on specific items.  In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.</p><p>  In 2012, Revenue carried out more than 537,000 compliance interventions, yielding more than &euro;492 million.  Considerable success has been achieved in combating the illegal trade in tobacco products.  In 2012, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 95.6 million cigarettes from 8,108 seizures.  A further 5,276 kilograms of other tobacco products were taken in 2012 from 1,395 seizures.  There were 22 convictions on indictment, and 110 summary convictions, during the year for offences related to the smuggling or sale of illicit cigarettes and tobacco.</p><p>  In addition to the on-going enforcement action against the illegal fuel trade, steps are being taken to ensure enhanced control and supervision at all stages of the fuel supply chain. Key actions include a strengthening of the licensing arrangements for businesses selling auto-fuel, and of the enforcement of licensing requirements.  In addition, new licensing requirements have been applied to persons dealing in marked fuels, with effect from 1 October 2012.  As well as these important licensing changes, a requirement operates from 1 January 2013 for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions.  This will facilitate Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.</p><p>  Given the links of organised criminality with the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating it.  Searches undertaken as part of intelligence-led operations have resulted in a considerable number of seizures of diesel and the closure of laundering plants, particularly in border counties.  In 2012, 11 oil laundries were detected and shut down and 199,000 litres of oil were seized along with 27 vehicles, 2 fork-lifts and 5 trailers.  There were 10 arrests in the course of these operations.  57 premises were closed in 2012.  In addition to the fuel seized at laundries, a further 902,087 litre of fuel were seized during the year, the greater part from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to them.</p><p>  Much of the focus of the Joint Investigation Units (JIUs) is on shadow economy activity and their operations include targeting illegal traders at markets and at seasonal events (Christmas fairs, outdoor concerts etc.).  During 2012, over 3,000 outdoor checks/visits/inspections were carried out by the JIU teams including 168 multi-agency operations.  The Revenue Commissioners hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed. The most recent meeting took place on January 30th.</p><p>  Changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity.  Two examples from 2012 include the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.  If any members of a Council wish to bring specific information on shadow economy activity to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, they may contact Planning Division, Bishop&rsquo;s Square, Redmond&rsquo;s Hill, Dublin 2, or at the direct line (01) 4244276.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-19a.508.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900078#WRK04200"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.</p><p>  SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles.  The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher.  SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department has published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This review is available on my Departments website: www.education.gov.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  However, the review also found that the allocation process is generally not well understood within schools and by parents nor is the purpose of the Scheme fully understood.  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals. However, the review did not recommend expanding the role of the SNA.</p><p>  My Department has established a working group which is presently implementing the recommendations of the SNA Value for Money report.  I can also advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 to advise me as Minister in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.  The NCSE have been asked to provide comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs.  This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including the prioritising of access to children with special needs to an individual education plan.  I can advise that this advice will consider:<blockquote>- the identification and assessment of children with special needs<br /><br />- the nature of supports provided for children- the way in which supports are allocated to schools and<br /><br />- how these supports are configured.</blockquote>The advice from the NCSE is expected in the coming months.  It is my intention that the significant resources to support children with Special Educational Needs are deployed to ensure the best possible outcomes for students.  The advice will be a key input into achieving this goal.</p></reply>

In common with all other sources of reckonable income, the full amount is taken into consideration for every individual student applying for a grant.  However, the income limits for grant eligibility are increased relative to the number of students in a family applying for a grant.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  The review panel suggested the Church of Ireland College of Education would be suitably positioned to join any of the first three new configurations.  In the course of consultation, I have advised the college authorities that while I cannot support all colleges remaining on their current campus, I am happy for them to negotiate their own destiny, consistent with their desire to protect their ethos within the broad parameters of the HEA report.  As you are aware, CICE publicly signalled its intention to join DCU, St Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute and I understand discussions are ongoing.</p></reply>

While the examinations operate to extremely tight timeframes the SEC places huge emphasis on operational efficiency, security, and quality at every stage of the operation.

As at that time, there were no reliable studies on the prevalence of autism in Ireland, the NCSE based this on the Task Force for Autism report which recommended that &quot;as an initial target, provision be made for services for at least 20 per 10,000 with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and for 36 per 10,000 with Asperger's Syndrome&quot;.</p><p>  A later international review of the literature of best practice provision in the education of people with autistic spectrum disorder (Parsons et al, 2009) commissioned by the NCSE, found that prevalence rates vary, with some systematic studies showing prevalence rates of up to 100 per 10,000 (1%) of people with ASD. </p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs.  In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.</p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools with additional teaching and/or care assistance.  Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.</p></reply>

Funding is being utilised to provide solutions to the needs of both unemployed individuals and employers. Part of the strategy of the MOMENTUM programme is to provide projects in areas where research has identified potential job placement and opportunities. The projects have been distributed nationally, thus providing a good regional spread - including areas of significant disadvantage. It should be noted that the MOMENTUM fund represents less than 1.5% of the overall further education budget.</p><p>  The MOMENTUM fund allocation is based on national research from organisation reports from agencies such as F&Aacute;S and FORFAS which indicate the types of occupations that have current job vacancies and MOMENTUM is focused on those areas.  Courses were selected using a competitive tender process administered by F&Aacute;S. This process was used to select the best courses that would deliver the results needed to place people in jobs.  F&Aacute;S cannot disclose the value of the contract awarded to the contractor in question, as this information is currently not in the public domain.  The tender scoring took the cost of the projects into account in the award of the contracts. Furthermore, the structure of the funding is based on a financial risk transfer model.  This means that the contractor's payments are based on the delivery of specific project outcomes, ensuring that the taxpayer gets the best value for money.</p></reply>

I have received a draft report from the implementation group.  This is currently under consideration and I will be consulting further with my cabinet colleagues in the matter in due course.  I can assure families that the intention behind this approach is to ensure that, at a time of reduced resources, the Government targets valuable schemes, such as the student grant scheme, at those who need them most.  Equally, it is to ensure that those who can afford to pay to go to higher education should do so.  Under any new means testing arrangement, families whose income and assets fall below a certain level, will continue to be eligible for third level grants for their children.</p></reply>

Students who qualify under my Department's student grant scheme have the student contribution paid on their behalf by the Exchequer.

Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms &ndash; or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.  However my officials are currently compiling a document to bring together and further clarify the various strands of policy in this area.</p><p>  My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.</p><p>  The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.</p><p>  This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.  My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.</p><p>  In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website and have also informed the policy. My Department was also mindful of contributions of many other experts at international conferences/visits have also informed the development views.  My Department continues to develop policy and programmes for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and will continue to take relevant professional advice into account in this regard.</p></reply>

The new Framework for Junior Cycle which I published last October will, inter alia, aim to increase the importance of physical wellbeing in several ways:</p><p> - The Framework is based on eight Principles. The Principle of &quot;Wellbeing&quot; undertakes to ensure that &quot;the student experience contributes directly to their physical wellbeing.&quot;</p><p> - In addition, eight Key Skills are required for successful learning across the curriculum and beyond the school. This is in recognition of the fact that learning takes place both inside and outside of the formal school environment. One of these Key Skills is &quot;Staying Well&quot;, which adopts a holistic approach to wellbeing and includes &quot;Being healthy, physical and active&quot;.</p><p> - Contained in the Junior Cycle's Statements of Learning is the stated aim that the student is &quot;confident and competent in physical activity and is motivated to be physically active&quot;, and that he/she &quot;understands the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices&quot;.</p><p> - Perhaps most importantly in this respect, the new junior cycle will enable schools to offer Physical Education as a short course, which means that, for the first time, it can be certified.</p><p>  The Active School Flag, funded by my Department, was officially launched in 2009 to motivate and award schools which strive to achieve a physically active and physically educated school community.  The funding provided to the ASF was &euro;116,000 per year for the past 3 years, and &euro;80,000 in 2012. Since September 2009, just over 1000 primary schools and 128 post-primary schools have registered for the programme. Some 180 schools have already been awarded their flags.  The ASF rewards schools in their efforts in this area and the Department sees it as its initiative to enhance a student's healthy lifestyle.  More schools are registering to participate each year.</p><p>  In 2009 my Department carried out a Lifeskills Survey in primary and post primary schools. They found that in addition to formal PE provision that some 90% of schools encourage not only  physical activity and regular exercise during school breaks but they also encourage the young people to participate in sport outside school time. The work in the school has to be complimented and reinforced by the families and the communities of our young people if the spread of childhood obesity is to be reduced.</p></reply>

Following the evaluation of these schemes, rain water harvesting systemifs were introduced for major school building projects in 2008.  Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.</p><p>  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.</p><p>  For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing measures to reduce water usage such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc.  To this end, as part of the Summer Works Scheme 2010, schools were invited to apply for Water Conservation measures.  A list of schools whose applications under this scheme were successful is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p><p>  In terms of research my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy efficiency (including water conservation and efficiency) in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p><p>  The overall Energy Research Programme won a Taoiseach Public Service Excellence Award in 2008.  My Department won the Energy Sustainability in the Built Environment Award for 2012 for Col&aacute;iste Choilm, Tullamore, at the SEAI Sustainable Energy Awards 2012.  My Department also won the Green Building of the Year award at the Green Awards 2012 and the Overall Green Award, based on the same project and for my Department's continued work in developing low energy sustainable schools.</p><p>  The Department's Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects.

I have no plans to introduce Coder Dojo into the curriculum at present. The overall approach to ICT, based on the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is that ICT is not a subject, but rather a tool to be integrated into all aspects of teaching and learning. The Council has published a curriculum framework for ICT setting out the range of skills and learning outcomes which students should achieve. This work is supported by professional development for teachers, by digital content on the Scoilnet website, and by investment in ICT infrastructure in schools.</p></reply>

The general position is that school books are zero-rated. The zero rate applies to printed books. All digitised publications are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT. The EU position is that digital information services are not the direct equivalent of traditional printed products, including books. Even where the content is similar, the additional functionality (e.g. search facilities, hyperlinks, archives, etc) associated with electronic content produces a fundamentally different product.</p></reply>

The Bill proceeded through its second stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 11th October 2012. I wish to advise the Deputy that officials in my Department are currently engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and other interested parties and I will be considering potential amendments which may be introduced at Committee Stage in the very near future. However, it is not possible for me to advise the Deputy as to the likely date for enactment of the Bill, as this depends on a number of factors which are outside my control, including the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.</p><p>  At the outset, let me say that the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be &#8220;net annual value&#8221; which is the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date. This is a long standing principle of the rateable valuation system in Ireland and ensures equity and fairness in relation to the values of commercial and industrial properties across a local authority area.</p><p>  The primary purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office. The Bill amends several provisions contained in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6, which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas between revaluations. In both instances, it is envisaged that the Commissioner of Valuation will appoint officers to carry out the tasks in question and the Bill makes specific provision for the appointment of &#8220;revision managers&#8221;. Section 6 of the Bill proposes to amend Section 19 of the Valuation Act 2001 by enabling the Commissioner to appoint persons to carry out the revaluation of entire rating authority areas. Such persons may be an officer of the Commissioner. However, provision is also made for the Commissioner to enter into an arrangement with a person or persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to assist in the performance of the revaluation function. The effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. This is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme. I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot revaluation project which will utilise such external resources.</p><p>  Following enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that revaluation projects can be conducted through the normal <i>direct assessment</i> methodology.  However, the Bill (Section 11, inserting a new Part 5A into the 2001 Act) also provides for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation using elements of <i>self-assessment</i> by ratepayers. This provision is also intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and I understand that, following enactment of the Bill, the Commissioner intends running a pilot project which will utilise self-assessment principles. Finally, I wish to draw the Deputy&#8217;s attention to Section 22 of the Bill which proposes to amend Section 48 of the 2001 Act by providing for the use of general market data or aggregated data (including <i>statistical and computer-aided techniques</i>  ) in determining valuations, where the Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so.</p></reply>

A total of 66 areas along the Shannon, including Cloondara/Clondra have been designated as Areas for Further Assessment under the Study. </p><p>  That assessment is being carried out by Jacobs Engineering, consultants for the Shannon CFRAM Study. Detailed flood hazard maps will be prepared and these will be made available for public consultation. Details of the Study and regular updates can be found on www.cfram.ie. or .  </p><p>  At the Office of Public Work's (OPW) request Jacobs Engineering undertook a review of the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the river Shannon with the purpose of identifying potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term. This review was carried out in advance of the detailed hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling which is being addressed within the overall Shannon CFRAM Study. </p><p>  That report and a non-technical summary of the Report - &lsquo;Understanding Water levels on the River Shannon&rsquo; was circulated to all public representatives in the region, last autumn. The OPW has also facilitated presentations by Jacobs Engineering on its report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and to the Irish Farmers Association.</p><p>  Arising from those consultations, it was agreed, to explore the possibility of carrying out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations, subject to favourable hydrological conditions. It has been agreed to involve the expertise of Jacobs Engineering, in order to advance the water monitoring proposal.</p></reply>

Under the Agreement, redeployment generally takes precedence over all other methods of filling a vacancy and supersedes any existing agreements on the deployment of staff.  It sets out the agreed redeployment arrangements within the Health, Education and Local Authority sectors and within and between the Civil Service and Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies (NCSSB).  It also provides that cross sectoral redeployments will follow the arrangements agreed for the NCSSBs.</p><p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), which has day-to-day operational responsibility for the implementation of redeployment, has put in place a system of Resource Panels of Civil Service and State Agency staff to support the redeployment processes in those sectors agreed under the Croke Park Agreement.  Posts to be filled by redeployment are offered in the first instance to the relevant panel or panels.  It is a matter for the employer to identify the number and grades of posts to be redeployed in the first instance and to upload the posts onto the PAS panels.  Employers can do this early in the redeployment process to maximise the opportunities to place their staff.  There is no set time-limit within which individuals awaiting redeployment must be redeployed.</p><p>  A &quot;Redeployment Toolkit&quot; which gives full details on each stage of the redeployment process has been agreed with the staff unions.  It includes a section setting out responses to Frequently Asked Questions and is available on my Department's website at <i></i><i><i>.</i></i></p></reply>

Against this background, proportionate reductions to existing public service pensions have been given effect through legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The current situation regarding public service pensions is as follows:</p><p>- Public service pensioners (including retired politicians) in Ireland have had their pensions cut. </p><p>- The <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010</i>   provided for the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR). The PSPR, commencing 1 January 2011, imposed significant reductions on public service pensions in payment, using a progressively tiered set of bands and rates with a top rate of 12% on any public service pension amount over &#8364;60,000. </p><p>- I have,  acting on foot of my concern about large public service pensions, amended the legislation to increase the top rate of PSPR to 20% on any public service pension amount over &#8364;100,000 (aside from other taxes and deductions). Initially the PSPR was imposed separately on each public service pension.  However, following an amendment introduced in the <i>Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012</i>, the PSPR will be imposed on the aggregated value of <b>all</b>   public service pensions held by a person who has more than one such pension.</p><p>- Public service pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, including those made by this Government, have impacted progressively so that higher earners have taken the hardest hit.  These pay cuts have been fully reflected in the pensions of persons who retired from 1 March 2012 onward.  The average pay cut imposed has been around 7%, but this extends to more than 20% for the highest earners, of whom senior officer holders are clearly one part. </p><p>- The new Single Public Service Pension Scheme will deliver pensions to future public servants on the basis of career-average earnings rather than final salary; this will impose (by comparison with pre-Single Scheme &quot;final salary&quot; norms) a particularly significant moderation in the level of pension awarded to higher paid public servants.</p></reply>

Such central arrangements are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.</p><p>  The NPS is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and compliance with EU procurement regulations; and enhanced service levels. Surveys carried out into public bodies, which switched from using their own contracts to the NPS contracts, have indicated that savings of up to 50% can be achieved.</p><p>  Prior to issuing tenders the NPS engages with its clients to ensure their requirements are met and that the most commonly bought items are included in the tender. Under the provision of Circular 06/12 it is however permissible for buyers to purchase goods and services from non-NPS suppliers if these goods and services are demonstrably cheaper.</p><p>  However, where a public service body purchases such goods or services it will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangements and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. </p><p>  Systems of internal control within public service bodies are to support compliance with the requirements of the circular. Public service bodies shall make available for review if requested by internal auditors, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Local Government Audit Service or other duly appointed auditors, details of internal controls in place to ensure compliance, and details of goods and services, subject to the mandate, acquired other than under mandated NPS central frameworks and the associated value for money justification.</p><p>  The NPS also has, as part of its education and development remit, an active programme to educate SMEs in how to participate effectively in the public service procurement process.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,500 SMEs nationwide. </p><p>  In NPS competitions, the tender documents explicitly seek to encourage the participation of SMEs. A prime example of this is when the NPS decided to divide the office supplies contract into three individual lots for Stationery, ICT Consumables and Paper. This was to increase the possibility for SMEs to tender individually, or form consortia that could enter competitive bids to win this national contract. </p><p>  Codex Ltd, an indigenous company, won the Stationery contract and are sourcing up to 60% of their products using 136 local agents and manufacturers. Furthermore, the ICT Consumables contract was also won by another Irish SME, Datapac Limited.</p></reply>

Ireland, in common with 12 other Member States including Germany and the United Kingdom, chose not to give effect to this option.  Accordingly, it is not unlawful per se for traders in Ireland to impose charges on consumers for the use of a particular method of payment.</p><p>  Article 19 of Directive 2011/83/EU provides that Member States &lsquo;shall prohibit traders from charging consumers in respect of the use of a given means of payment, fees that exceed the cost borne by the trader for the use of such means.&rsquo; Though this Article does not prohibit payment charges as such, it aims to ensure that such charges reflect the real cost of payment instruments to the trader and are not used as a source of additional revenue.  </p><p>  Shortly after the adoption of the Directive, I stated my intention to give early effect to the provisions of Article 19 and Article 22. To this end, my Department issued the consultation paper on the implementation of the two Articles referred to above. One of the issues raised by the consultation has required my Department to seek legal advice from the Attorney General and the European Commission. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of the legal issue concerned, it remains my intention to give early effect to Articles 19 and 22.</p></reply>

All job creation initiatives are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. This is a multi-annual process which has the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 new jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. </p><p>  The Action Plan is a whole of Government approach with a national focus across all regions and contains a comprehensive range of job creation initiatives. These include legislation to reform statutory wage setting mechanisms, a reduction or freezing of charges levied on business by Government across a large range of Government Departments and agencies, the enactment of the Legal Service Bill which will place downward pressure on insurance costs, the &euro;90m Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, the &euro;450m Credit Guarantee Scheme, the &euro;120m second call under Innovation Fund Ireland and the &euro;150m Development Capital Scheme. The combined effect of initiatives such as these is to sustain existing jobs and to create new ones. </p><p>  The Enterprise Development agencies are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs and continue to ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and jobs growth. In 2012, 6,570 net new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies and 2012 was the agency&rsquo;s third consecutive year of growth in net employment. IDA&rsquo;s client base now employs 152,785 people, a level last recorded before the global financial crisis began in 2008. 2012 saw the creation of 3,338 net new jobs in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI), the highest net new jobs figure since 2006. The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) created 417 net new jobs in 2012.</p><p>  The Government published on 1 February 2013, the fourth and final quarterly progress report under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. This Report shows that 249 - or 92% - out of the 270 measures committed to be implemented in 2012 by all 15 Government Departments and 36 Agencies under the Action Plan for Jobs, have been delivered. </p><p>  I am currently finalising the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, which will be published in the coming days.</p></reply>

Donegal.  In the same period, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s client companies created 739 new jobs in Donegal.  At present, there are   14 IDA Ireland client companies in Co. Donegal employing 2,228 people of which 178 are part time positions.  Details of the number of site visits and new jobs created in each of the years 2008 to 2012 are set out in the attached tabular statements.</p><p>Donegal&rsquo;s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity.  IDA Ireland is actively encouraging new investment in Donegal in knowledge   based industries and is actively promoting Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  In October last KeyedIn Solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over three years.</p><p>IDA&rsquo;s commitment to delivering business to Letterkenny and Sligo in the North West Region continues in line with IDA&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Horizon 2020&rsquo;.  Also, in line with &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020</i>  ,&rdquo; IDA works with corporate and local management in existing client companies to improve competitiveness and efficiencies, enhance their use of technology, up-skill employees, engage in RD&amp;I and develop their business processes so as to ensure the maintenance of the existing jobs provided by these companies in Ireland.</p><p>IDA prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.</p><p>Another primary focus for IDA Ireland in Donegal is the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ). The NWBTZ is aimed at promoting the linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.</p><p>I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have, accordingly, raised this matter with the CEO of IDA Ireland with a view to exploring what further initiatives can be taken to influence potential investors to invest in such locations.</p><p><b>Table showing the number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland Client Companies in County Donegal in each of the years 2008 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Employment</th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2008</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2009</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2010</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2011</div></th><th bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>2012</div></th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Number of New Jobs created </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>67</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>63</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>152</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>271</div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div>186</div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA sponsored site visits to County Donegal in each of the years 2008 to 2012</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Site Visits</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-02-19a.751.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013021900082#WRO03700"><p>The same supports are provided to carers regardless of their residence with just one difference. Since April 2012 those in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment are not entitled to household benefits in their own right.  For those who do reside with the person being cared for, the person is likely to already have an entitlement of their own to household benefits.  Approximately 31,000 carers receive a household benefits package.</p><p>  My Department provides a number of supports to carers. The two main weekly income support payments are the means tested carer&rsquo;s allowance (including half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance) and the PRSI based carer&rsquo;s benefit. In addition to either of these payments, non-resident carers continue to be entitled to the annual respite care grant and free travel.</p><p>  In general, to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit, the carer must live with the person being cared for. However, where the carer is not resident with the person they are caring for, the circumstances may still be suitable to allow them to provide full time care and attention.  In these cases, there must be a system of communication between the carer&rsquo;s residence and that of the care recipient such as telephone or an alarm type system. The care recipient must not already be receiving full time care and attention within his or her own residence from another person. </p><p>  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant; and &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance. </p><p>  There are over 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Of these, over 23,000 are getting half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance in addition to another social welfare payment. There are approximately 1,700 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  </p><p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is the most generous within the social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for maximum payment carer&rsquo;s allowance which such a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate and may also qualify for the household benefits package. A person receiving carer&rsquo;s allowance is also entitled to a free travel pass. </p><p>  The annual respite care grant is paid automatically to those in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and domiciliary care allowance in June of each year. The grant is not means tested and is also available to those people who are not in receipt of a one of the above payments but are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs this care.</p></reply>

Persons are engaged for 19&frac12; hours per week to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  The scheme currently provides work opportunities for around 2,600 participants and 130 supervisory staff.  I have no plans to increase the number of places available on this scheme.  The funds allocated for 2013 amount to &euro;45m, which should enable the scheme to continue as in previous years but does not allow for the recruitment of additional participants above the numbers stated above.  The Department of Social Protection has recently published a review of employment support schemes which, together with the outcome of the focused policy assessment of the RSS which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has indicated it intends to conduct this year, will inform future policy developments of the scheme.</p></reply>

Amongst the supports available is the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) and the part time education option (PTEO).  These supports may be available to persons on qualifying social welfare payments.</p><p>  One of the conditions for receipt of BTEA is that a person in receipt of a jobseekers payment, under the age of 21 years of age, must be out of formal education for at least two years.  BTEA is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid in lieu of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.</p><p>  However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while retaining their jobseekers payment under PTEO of the back to education programme.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.</p><p>  The person in question is not in receipt of a social welfare payment or has never received a social welfare payment in their own right.  The Department of Social Protection does not offer specific income supports for students outside of the Back to Education programme.</p></reply>

One of the ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and on their nomination, a replacement member was appointed from 24th October 2011. All appointments were due for renewal on 4th October 2012. Four members of the previous board and one new person, nominated by IBEC, were appointed to the new board effective from the 5th October 2012.</p><p>  Legislation provides that the four ordinary members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the two relevant bodies, ICTU and IBEC.  Both bodies forwarded their nominations and were duly approved and appointed by me.  The Chairperson is sourced by the Department of Social Protection by way of a recommendation from the Labour Court with regard to a particular candidate&rsquo;s suitability.  The Chairperson, who was re-appointed in 2012, has held the position since 2003.  He is a former Rights Commissioner with extensive experience in dispute resolution and has been proven to hold all of the qualifications, skills and competencies necessary for the position.  </p><p>  The revised Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies does not apply to the Social Welfare Tribunal due to its structure and purpose.</p></reply>

These administrative arrangements were initially introduced to encourage persons to take up employment as a home help at a time when the remuneration from such employment was low.  This is no longer the case as the status and salary levels were formalised in 2000.  As the salary scale is now well ahead of the national minimum wage, there was no longer a basis for this special treatment.  The change advanced the objective of treating all income in the same way for means testing purposes with no special arrangements depending on the type of employment.</p><p>  Since January 2012, persons working as a home help benefit from the standard earnings disregards and tapering arrangements which apply to the assessment of earnings.  These vary across schemes and the current arrangements are now outlined in the case of one parent family payment, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance: </p><p>-	  One-parent family payment: the first &euro;110 is disregarded in full and amounts between &euro;110 and &euro;425 are assessed at 50%.</p><p>-	  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance: the first &euro;20 per day, subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, is disregarded in full and 60% of the balance assessed.  </p><p>-	  Disability allowance: the first &euro;120 per week of earnings from a rehabilitative nature is disregarded, any balance between &euro;120 per week and &euro;350 per week is assessed at 50% and any remaining balance is assessed in full.</p><p>  Where the spouse/partner of a jobseeker&rsquo;s or disability allowance recipient is in employment the first &euro;20 per day of his or her earnings, subject to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, is disregarded in full and 60% of the balance assessed.  </p><p>  The arrangements which applied in relation to the assessment of home help earnings prior to January 2012 varied across schemes.  For example, the treatment of the earnings of a qualified adult as a home help varied in the case of disability allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; it was disregarded in full in the case of disability allowance and assessed in the same way as all other earnings in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p><p>  Disability allowance was introduced in 1996 and replaced the Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance (DPMA) which had been administered by the Health Boards. In the case of the latter scheme, earnings arising from the employment of a claimant&rsquo;s spouse/partner as a home help were disregarded if full.  These arrangements were continued in the Department of Social Protection, on a non-statutory administrative basis until the change outlined above was introduced in January 2012.</p><p>  If a person feels that the assessment procedures outlined above were not correctly applied to their claim before or after January 2012, they may request their local social welfare office to review their claim.  If it is established that their means were incorrectly assessed, any arrears due to them will be paid.</p></reply>

As advised by my colleague, Richard Bruton, T.D., Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in response to Parliamentary Question 6485/13, the National Employments Rights Authority (NERA) investigates complaints in relation to breaches of employment law.  Any complaints received by NERA in relation to au pairs would first be examined using the &ldquo;Code of Practice for Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&rdquo; in order to determine whether or not the person is in fact an employee.</p><p>  If the person is determined to be an employee, they enjoy the full protection of Irish Employment Law and the NERA inspection and enforcement procedures operate in the normal way.  A Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes (S.I. No. 239 of 2007) is in place and can be accessed on NERA&rsquo;s website.  Where people have concerns that employees may be exploited, or may be receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.</p><p>  Section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a legal contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a legal contract of employment.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under such a contract of employment in another person&rsquo;s home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under law as all other employees.</p><p>  Employments in the State under a contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, may be insurable for social insurance purposes.  A person aged over 16 years and under pensionable age (currently 66 years) may be regarded as an employed contributor for social insurance purposes and, subject to payment of the appropriate PRSI contributions and satisfying the other qualifying conditions, may qualify for the full range of long and short- term social insurance benefits.  For Class A employees, PRSI at the rate of 4% is payable based on their weekly earnings.  In addition, employers are required to pay PRSI at the rate of 10.75% in respect of their employees.</p><p>  In addition, as Minister Burton advised, the Department of Justice and Equality operates the student visa scheme and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have responsibility for childcare matters.  Accordingly, any issues in regard to these matters should be addressed to those Departments.</p></reply>

The key elements of this package are to add an additional 2,500 places to JobBridge; 2,000 places on community employment; 2,500 to T&uacute;s &#8211; the community work placement initiative - and the development of a new initiative with local authorities to provide 3,000 opportunities in 2013.  Development work on this new initiative has commenced with local authorities and I hope to be in a position to agree a number of pilot projects to inform the design of this important initiative in the coming weeks. The focus of this new scheme will be on those on the live register for 24 months or more.</p><p>  People with disabilities and on related disability payment schemes from the Department of Social Protection are eligible to apply for a number of schemes, the details of which are available on the Department&#8217;s website &#8211; .  In addition, there are also a number of practical supports and allowances available to employers to proactively assist the participation of people with a disability in the workforce. Funding can be provided to employers who wish to retain an employee who has acquired an impairment or illness and to employ a person with a disability. The Department also funds the EmployAbility service nationwide, which is designed to enable jobseekers with a disability to secure open labour market employment with assistance of tailored individual supports provided by job coaches. Given the opportunities that currently exist, I have no plans to consider opening up more schemes to those on disability payments.</p></reply>

In December 2012, there were approximately 14,400 customers in receipt of SPT.</p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for changes to State pension age. From 1<sup>st</sup>  January 2014 the abolition of SPT will standardise the age for payment of a State pension to 66 years.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2021 and to 68 years from 2028.   </p><p>  The abolition of SPT removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive for people to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment. There is no retirement condition attached to the SPC.  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 may apply for another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p><p>  In February 2012, my Department held meetings with the representative groups for older people to outline the changes to SPT and SPC. Feedback was sought from these groups and included in an information pack that was prepared to further publicise the changes to the scheme.  The finalised information pack was published in early March 2012 on the Department&#8217;s website,  and was also made available through the Citizens Information Board website   .  A link to the information pack was also tweeted to the Department's followers on Twitter. It was widely circulated to customer representative groups including those representing older people, working age groups, farming groups, trade unions, employer groups, accountancy bodies etc. It was also forwarded to all members of the Oireachtas.  Presentations on the introduction of these changes were also made at the Department&#8217;s regular briefings with customer representative groups and to members of the public over the course of the year.  A further information campaign is planned for quarter 2, 2013 to continue to raise awareness of the changes.</p></reply>

However medical eligibility does not automatically transfer across to a different scheme. Although the legislation in regard to medical eligibility for carer&rsquo;s allowance is very similar to that of carer&rsquo;s benefit, they are not identical. Section 179(4)(b) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 relating to carer's allowance is significant here. It states that &quot;a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where the person has such a disability that he or she is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months&rdquo;.</p><p>  In carrying out the assessment of the case, the medical assessor considered all evidence presented and expressed an opinion based on findings. The medical assessor expressed the following opinion in regard to this case on the 4th  December 2012: &ldquo;While care recipient clearly needs additional care and attention, however based on all medical reports and evidence available to me at this time, I am of the opinion that the need for continuous care and attention does not comply with the criteria for eligibility for CA&rdquo;.  Taking all material into account, the deciding officer decided to disallow carer&rsquo;s allowance.</p></reply>

SPT will cease to be paid from 2014 which will standardise the payment of pension at age 66.  In addition, the age at which State pension (contributory) (SPC) will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028.</p><p>  In December 2012, there were just under 14,400 SPT recipients compared to 312,300 recipients of SPC.  Only 1,700 people, or 12% in all, were awarded SPT directly from employment while almost half were already in receipt of another social welfare payment.</p><p>  A person who retires from work on reaching age 65 and who does not have sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for SPT may apply for  another social welfare payment, depending on their individual circumstances.</p><p>  The abolition of SPT in 2014 removes the retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment.   The continued participation of older people in the labour market must be encouraged and facilitated to meet the challenge of an ageing society.  Employees and employers need to be persuaded to change their attitudes to working longer.  In the workplace, employers should try to retain older employees and create working conditions which make working longer both attractive and possible for the older worker.  At present, my Department is working with other Departments and relevant State agencies who have a role to play in identifying and breaking down barriers to remaining in work past the age of 65.</p><p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Raising State pension age and the abolition of SPT is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future and to address the challenges of changing demographics such as increasing life expectancy.</p></reply>

Actions have included the closure of the mixed stock drift net fishery, the closure of individual rivers and catchments to exploitation where salmon production is shown to have fallen below their conservation limit, together with a significant investment programme in salmon habitat restoration.  It is my intention that the continued focus on conservation based management and investment in habitat restoration will help to restore salmon stocks to their historic levels.</p><p>  Since 2007 Ireland has managed salmon stocks on an individual river-by-river basis, with exploitation of salmon only permitted where salmon in that catchment are above their conservation limit.  In a situation where a catchment has a surplus of salmon available for exploitation, the available surplus may be allocated between the commercial fishery and recreational anglers, based on the analysis of local stakeholders and the decision of local management following recommendations from the local Fishery District Committee.</p><p>  As rivers with surpluses have been identified on an individual river basis by the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon, following careful analysis of a wide range of data, I am confident that draft netting of part of the surplus of salmon for a particular river does not pose a problem to the sustainability of the stock.</p></reply>

This will determine whether it is beneficial for both countries to enter into an Inter-Governmental Agreement under the Renewable Energy Directive to provide for renewable energy trading.</p><p>  If an Inter-Governmental Agreement is entered into, there are potential significant employment opportunities.  As an example, employment creation arising from a 3,000 MW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  There would also be additional jobs created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20-year operating life.  Further employment opportunities could arise if turbines or components were to be manufactured in Ireland.  Policy certainly is important in that regard.  Additionally, all relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, would have to coordinate their activities early in the process to ensure employment potential of export projects is maximised.  This opportunity has already been identified by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.</p></reply>

This investment will provide significant choice to the consumer.  While fibre to the home (FTTH) is currently not widely available to homes and multi-dwelling units (MDUs) in Ireland, broadband networks, which are serviced by fibre, are increasingly providing high speed services to the home:</p><p>- Eircom is currently investing up to &euro;500 million in a phased deployment of fibre to the cabinet infrastructure, which is planned to make high-speed broadband available to 1.15 million premises by December 2014.  The network has already reached more than 200,000 premises and is expected to be launched in 2013,</p><p>- UPC is investing &euro;500 million its cable and fibre network, which is delivering speeds of up to 150 Mbps to homes and MDUs.  UPC Aims to have this service available to 700,000 homes by 2015.</p><p>- BT is trialling Fibre to the Cabinet technologies that will deliver broadband at up to 80 Mbps.  BT provides this infrastructure to Vodafone and Sky.</p><p>- Mobile telecommunications operators will be rolling out advanced mobile broadband products in 2013, following the recent multi-band spectrum auction with the explosion in the use of smart phones and tablet devices, the use of advanced mobile broadband is of increasing significance and it is expected that fibre connections will be required to service many of the base stations that transmit mobile signals.</p><p>  Many of these developments were signaled in the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last.  The commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70 Mbps to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  In this context, the Government is committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

The Council conclusions on last year&rsquo;s Commission renewable energy communication invited the Commission to present non-binding guidance to further improve national support schemes in order to achieve further cost reduction and market integration, as well as separate guidance on the implementation of the cooperation mechanisms provided for in the Renewable Energy Directive.  The Commission is expected to publish its report in May and the Irish Presidency will facilitate discussions on it.  The Energy Council in June will deliver Council conclusions on the Internal Energy Market Communication.  This communication sets out actions to drive towards the achievement of the internal market for energy.  The aim of achieving this internal market is to benefit customers, promote competition, achieve sustainability of supply and to decarbonise the electricity industry through increased renewable energy penetration and the improvement of infrastructure.</p><p>  Another area to be progressed during the Presidency is the revision of the Energy Tax Directive in order to promote energy efficiency and use of more environmentally friendly energy sources including renewable sources.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency is also progressing discussions on the proposal to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive to take into account the indirect land use change impacts of biofuels.  These proposals include measures which would incentivise the production and use of next generation biofuels.  There will be orientation debates at the February Energy Council and March Environment Council and it is the Presidency's aim to produce a Progress Report for both Councils in June.  Finally, last month the Commission published a draft Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure.  The aim of this proposed directive is to reduce dependency on oil throughout the EU by ensuring that adequate infrastructure is available in Member States both for the supply of alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas, hydrogen and biofuels and for the charging of Electric Vehicles.  The Commission will present on its proposal at the Transport Council on 11 March and there will be a first exchange of views by Member States.</p></reply>

The Regulation will now be the subject of agreement by the Council and requires the consent of the European Parliament before it is adopted.  While the proposed cut to the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is regrettable, I do not anticipate that there will be any significant impact on Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious plans, as set out last year in the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP).  The plan aims to ensure that all premises in the country, irrespective of location, will have access to high-speed broadband in line with the targets set by the EU in the Digital Agenda for Europe.  It did not specifically envisage support from the CEF, which is targeted at enhancing the case for commercial investment.</p><p>  As the NBP outlines, most of the investment in broadband roll-out is expected to come from the private sector and there is strong evidence of this investment now taking place.  For example, both UPC and eircom have ongoing ambitious capital investment plans and the mobile operators in the Irish market recently made very significant investments in acquiring newly-released spectrum which was auctioned by ComReg and will be used to roll out advanced mobile broadband services.  The State will only intervene in those parts of the country which are not deemed commercially viable for commercial investment.  My Department has recently advertised for technical, economic and financial assistance to identify this market gap and design an appropriate procurement process, in line with the ambition as expressed in the NBP.</p></reply>

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between the above factors.  Under the EIA Directive, it is not possible to permit a project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact.  In this context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has commenced a process to issue a public call inviting interested parties to tender for the offer of funding from both the EPA Strive Programme and my Department to conduct detailed research on the use of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, in particular with regard to the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) technology.  The study follows on from the preliminary research into the environmental aspects of shale gas extraction, conducted by the University of Aberdeen, which was published by the EPA in May 2012.</p><p>  The proposed terms of reference for this study have been developed and are currently the subject of a Public Consultation Process which was launched on 11 January 2013.  Interested parties have been invited to submit written comments by 8 March 2013.  Further details are available from the EPA website (). The final results of this study are expected in early 2015.  As I have confirmed to the House on a number of previous occasions, no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of this further EPA research.</p></reply>

The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.</p><p>  In an important milestone towards delivery of the commitments in the Plan, the Government recently launched a tender for experts to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to in the Plan, to ensure that all parts of Ireland will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

Network costs are reviewed every five years and used to establish maximum allowed revenues for BG&Eacute;'s transmission and distribution activities for a given year of the five-year period.  The allowed revenues are used to determine the network tariff for each year.  In August 2012, the CER published a Decision Paper on gas transmission revenue and tariffs for the period October 2012 to September 2013.  This Decision has resulted in increases in the transmission tariff paid by shippers.  These increases were based on the forecast bookings for capacity submitted in April 2012 by Bord G&aacute;is Networks (BGN), based on demand estimates.  Since then there has been a persistent decline in primary capacity bookings on the gas transmission system.  This, in turn, puts further upward pressure on unit tariffs required to remunerate investments in the system.  In November 2012, the CER published its decision on the 5 Year Gas Networks Tariff Review (PC3) which set the revenues BGN is allowed over the period.  The decision took account of the emerging significant reductions in forecast primary bookings supplied by BGN.  These forecasts indicated a fall of approximately 18% in bookings from BGN&rsquo;s original forecast for the five year period of the review.</p><p>  The CER is currently undertaking an interim review of BGN Allowed Revenues and gas transmission tariffs for 2012/2013, as determined in the August 2012 decision.  A consultation is currently under way and will close on 22 February.  The review involves detailed assessment of BGN&rsquo;s own recent proposals, followed by a consultation on the CER&rsquo;s proposed decision which envisages a 13.2% increase in the transmission tariff with effect from April 2013.  While some increase in the transmission tariff charged by BGN to shippers with effect from April 2013 may be unavoidable, it is not anticipated at this stage that there will be an increase in the regulated retail tariff to end customers from April.  The CER will also be consulting on a number of other means of addressing the decline in the primary bookings on the transmission system which has persisted and indeed grown in recent times.</p></reply>

It is unlikely that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 energy and climate change targets can be met through the provision of state incentives alone.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.</p><p>Energy suppliers have the option of either signing a voluntary energy savings agreement with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) or being subject to a statutory Energy Efficiency Notice issued under the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2012.</p><p>The following 16 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements in lieu of an Energy Efficiency Notice for the period 2011-2013:</p><p>-Airtricity</p><p>-Bord G&aacute;is Energy</p><p>-Bord na M&oacute;na</p><p>-Energia</p><p>-Electric Ireland</p><p>-VAYU</p><p>-Irish Petroleum Industry Association (includes ConocoPhillips, ESSO, Inver, Maxol, Valero, Tedcastles, Topaz)</p><p>-Calor</p><p>-Arigna Fuels</p><p>-Stafford Fuels.</p><p>Energy suppliers that have signed voluntary agreements with the SEAI are known as Participating Energy Suppliers (PES).  These companies account for over 90% of the overall Energy Supplier Target that needs to be achieved by the end of 2013.  The SEAI is in the process of finalising the 2013 Annual Plans from these companies.  The Department and the SEAI are also in discussions with a small number of additional energy suppliers who have not yet finalised voluntary agreements.</p><p>A three year programme target of 2,000GWh was set for the period 2011-2013; to be achieved by a combination of energy supplier-led initiatives and SEAI programme activity.  The target for 2011 was 500GWh, which was met (533GWh were delivered).  The combined target for 2012 and 2013 is 750GWh.</p><p>It is not possible to provide the specific energy savings achieved by individual energy suppliers, as targets are based on commercially sensitive energy sales data, provided to the SEAI for analysis on a confidential basis.  Table 1 provides a breakdown of energy savings, as opposed to CO2 savings, achieved by sector on an annual basis for all savings achieved; Table 2 provides a breakdown of energy savings achieved by sector for savings achieved in the residential sector. Projects from 2009-2011 were bundled into one group as energy suppliers were permitted to report historic savings and count these against the 2011 target.</p><p>The energy credits available for each measure in residential properties is outlined at Table 3.</p><p>It is not possible at this time to provide a cost per kWh for energy suppliers to achieve their target, as this will vary depending on the delivery method and the sector.  However, the Department and the SEAI are engaged in an economic analysis of the programme at present.</p><p>Information supplied by the SEAI shows that 81% of the target for 2011 and 2012 was achieved by the end of 2012.  While this is a positive start, and indicative of a start-up period during which energy suppliers had to set up internal systems, there will need to be a substantial increase in engagement from energy suppliers in 2013 in order to achieve the necessary energy savings targets.</p><p>Legislation is already in place requiring energy suppliers to offer homeowners energy saving products.  Where a Participating Energy Supplier is not complying or is not likely to comply with the terms of a voluntary agreement, the Minister may revoke his approval of a voluntary agreement and issue an energy efficiency notice under Section 11 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012.  In this case, or in cases where a voluntary agreement between an energy supplier and the SEAI is not in place, the provisions of Section 11 (2) allow the Minister to require the energy supplier to take appropriate steps to address the deficiency.</p><p>Failure to comply satisfactorily with an energy efficiency notice may result in the Minister issuing a direction under Section 11 (7), specifying the remedial action the energy supplier should take and the timeframe this should be completed in.  In the event of continued non-compliance following a direction, the Minister may apply to the High Court for an order directing the energy supplier to comply with the direction.</p><p>The publication of the Energy Efficiency Directive in November 2012 provides for Member States to establish Energy Supplier Obligation Schemes. This is a standing item for discussion with energy suppliers at the quarterly governance meeting chaired by my Department. Decisions on a replacement for the existing programme, including mandatory targets, will be informed by the economic analysis currently being undertaken, performance of the energy suppliers and the distance to target that remains to be delivered at the end of 2013.  I expect to be in a position to communicate my decision regarding the replacement programme later this year.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Energy savings achieved by sector </b></p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Industry Sector*</b></div></th><th><div><b>2011 (GWh)</b></div></th><th><div><b>2012 (GWh)</b></div></th><th><div><b>Total (GWh)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Electricity </td><td><div>96.43</div></td><td><div>55.67</div></td><td><div>152.09</div></td></tr><tr><td>Gas</td><td><div>53.07</div></td><td><div>25.52</div></td><td><div>78.59</div></td></tr><tr><td>Oil</td><td><div>13.15</div></td><td><div>50.02</div></td><td><div>63.17</div></td></tr><tr><td>Solid Fuel </td><td><div>27.2</div></td><td><div>49.56</div></td><td><div>76.76</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div><b>189.85</b></div></td><td><div><b>180.77</b></div></td><td><div><b>370.62</b></div></td></tr></table></p><p>*As industry is split into sectors depending on their majority business, a company which sells 60% electricity and 40% gas is recorded as electricity.</p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Domestic and non-domestic energy savings</b></p><p><table><tr><th><div></div></th><th><div><b>2011 (GWh)</b></div></th><th><div><b></b><b>2012 (GWh)</b></div></th><th><div><b></b><b>Total (GWh)</b></div></th></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>Domestic</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>28</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>32.89</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>60.89</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Electricity</div></td><td><div>4.35</div></td><td><div>7.67</div></td><td><div>12.02</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Gas</div></td><td><div>21.66</div></td><td><div>0.13</div></td><td><div>21.79</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Oil</div></td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>24.6</div></td><td><div>24.6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Solid Fuel</div></td><td><div>1.99</div></td><td><div>0.48</div></td><td><div>2.48</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>Non-Domestic</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>161.84</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>147.88</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>309.71</b></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Electricity</div></td><td><div>92.08</div></td><td><div>47.99</div></td><td><div>140.07</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Gas</div></td><td><div>31.41</div></td><td><div>25.39</div></td><td><div>56.8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Oil</div></td><td><div>13.15</div></td><td><div>25.42</div></td><td><div>38.57</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Solid Fuel</div></td><td><div>25.2</div></td><td><div>49.07</div></td><td><div>74.27</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>Total</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>189.84</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>180.76</b></div></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><div><b>370.62</b></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Neither I nor the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the market regulator, has statutory authority to impose regulated maximum retail price limits on service providers operating in a competitive market.  ComReg does have statutory authority to impose a universal service obligation (USO) on one or more service providers to ensure all reasonable requests for a basic set of telecommunications service are available at fixed locations throughout the State.  The current USO, which is addressed to Eircom, limits the amount by which telephone line charges can be increased to the annual change in the consumer price index and includes the operation of a low usage scheme "eircom vulnerable user scheme", which can benefit users who have consistently low usage charges, currently less than &euro;17.21 per month.</p></reply>

Details of broadband services available on a County-by-County basis can be found on the website of the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) at www.callcosts.ie.  The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS.  The Scheme offers a basic broadband service, in line with EU State aid clearance, to fixed residences and businesses located within certain designated Electoral Divisions.  In County Laois, NBS services are available within 28 of its 98 Electoral Divisions.  Under EU State Aid rules, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p><p>  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched in 2011 in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision.  This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the NBS.  Commercial service providers were in a position to offer services to almost all applicants under the Scheme who agreed to engage with them, including applicants from County Laois.</p><p>  In addition to consumer services, there is a State-funded Metropolitan Area Network in Portlaoise.  These networks provide high capacity fibre connectivity for businesses and telecoms operators in the region.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland has met the EU Commission&rsquo;s Digital Agenda for Europe target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013, and the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  Specifically, it commits to: 70Mbps to 100Mbps available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015, At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% and potentially as much as 35% of the population, and A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country.</p><p>  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The commercial sector is already making these investments in high speed services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.  The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.</p><p>  My Department is making preparations to commence a formal national mapping exercise to identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  This will inform the level of Government interaction that may be required and the areas that need to be targeted for a State-led investment.  It will also form a critical input to an EU State Aid application in respect of any State-led intervention.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and business can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including County Laois, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.</p></reply>

This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process which makes very extensive statutory provision for public consultation.</p><p>  The guidelines state that while the designation of an area for protection of natural or built heritage or as an amenity does not automatically preclude wind energy development, consideration of any such development in or near these areas must be subject to Ireland's obligations under the Habitats Directive, the Birds Directive and the EIA Directive.  Clear guidance should be available in development plans on policy and objectives on the natural and built heritage, and the information contained therein on location and status should be accurate and up to date.</p></reply>

Grant aid of &euro;900,000 was approved and drawn down in respect of the Ballymahon project with the final payment being made in October, 2011.  In addition, my Department provided &euro;80,000 for the purchase and fit out of a library vehicle in 2010.

To ensure effective targeting of resources, loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only. Income limits are also in place, distinguishing between single and dual income households and a maximum loan limit is applied.  In assessing loan applications local authorities take account of the household&rsquo;s ability to finance the loan based on their net household income.  While, as a general rule, the credit policy provides that loans are not available to those in receipt of unemployment/social welfare benefits, an exception may be made where there is a primary income of a permanent waged/salaried nature, and where the secondary income is from the Department of Social Protection.  In such cases long term social welfare payments can be considered, provided the long term nature of the payment is confirmed.  The final decision on whether to grant/refuse an applicant lies solely with the relevant local authority. All local authorities must satisfy themselves on the financial risk they are undertaking.</p></reply>

Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the domestic water metering programme and for the collection of water charges from households from 2014.</p><p>  The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them.  As the metering programme will still be underway in 2014, an appropriate approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will need to be put in place before then; this will be the subject of a public consultation process this year as part of the regulatory process.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.</p><p>  The social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;332.7m in 2012, with an anticipated outturn of some &euro;299m for 2013, and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities have been operating, a tentative out-turn in the order of 4,000 housing units was achieved in 2012.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply, it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.</p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as social leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.</p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are working closely with NAMA with the aim of ensuring that a significant number of housing units are made available in this way by NAMA in the current year and beyond.</p></reply>

Air quality monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that the ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin and the ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas. The ban currently applies in twenty cities and towns.</p><p>  The main legislative provisions that apply inside specified smoky coal ban areas are as follows: a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel; requirement to sell smokeless coal in sealed bags with a printed notice; requirement to maintain a register if storing bituminous fuel for the purpose of placing on the market or on sale at a separate location outside the ban area; bituminous fuel can only be transported in minimum quantities of 3 metric tonnes in Dublin or 1 tonne inside other ban areas; and drivers of vehicles transporting bituminous fuel must hold a record detailing the type of fuel on board, who supplied it and where it is being transported to.</p><p>  On 31 August 2012, following a public consultation process, I gave effect to new consolidating solid fuel regulations, the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012. Some improved and updated provisions were introduced that will help to ensure that the Regulations remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.  These are as follows: most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account; seven new  towns will be added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel was provided for, to complement the established ban on its marketing, sale and distribution.</p><p>  The Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.  This consolidates the environmental and related human health benefits achieved by an earlier voluntary agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG), representing the majority of major coal importers.</p><p>  Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in bituminous coal must be registered with the EPA.  Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of bituminous coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from bituminous coal.  However all retailers who trade in bituminous coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number.</p><p>  The Regulations continue to be enforced by local authority authorised persons.  Authorised persons may undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel as well as collect samples.  A local authority may bring a prosecution under section 11 of the Air Pollution Act 1987 for breaches of the Regulations.  The maximum penalty for breaches of the Regulations is a fine of &euro;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months on summary conviction.</p></reply>

My Department received a delegated sanction from the Department of Finance in August 2009 for implementation of this general moratorium on the filling of public sector posts across all local authorities.</p><p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for County and City managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained within budgetary and staffing constraints.</p><p>  Where vacancies arise, local authorities must consider all options for reorganisation and reallocation of work to meet requirements.  Any exceptions to the moratorium require sanction from my Department.  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need further to reduce overall staffing levels in the local authority sector.  My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure that key posts are filled.  In this regard, the majority of the sanctions granted are for the filling of posts in frontline service areas such as fire and emergency services, water services, roads maintenance, housing, community and enterprise, and in relation to capital projects.  Of the 585 requests received in respect of Fire and Emergency service posts since 2009, 480 have been sanctioned, 8 have been withdrawn, 3 have been refused and 94 are pending.</p><p>  In view of the financial position facing local authorities, and the country as a whole, it is necessary to continue to focus on achieving the greatest possible savings.  In this context, my Department and local authorities will continue to make every effort to ensure that further efficiencies and savings are attained by the sector while an appropriate level of service to the public is maintained.</p></reply>

In a February 1995 report to my Department, <i>Identification of the Outer Limits of Estuaries in Ireland</i>, the EPA, in consultation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, established the outer limit of the estuary of the Foyle river in that context.  The objective criteria used in the establishment of these limits were geomorphic and chemical (i.e. salinity) factors.  I understand that alternative criteria were used by the UK authorities in establishing the limits in the Severn and Humber estuaries.</p><p>  The outer limit of Lough Foyle was subsequently used in the identification of the estuary as a transitional water under the Water Framework Directive and the remaining waters of the Lough outside this boundary as a coastal water, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 7 of the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations, 2003.  All surface water and groundwater bodies have been classified in accordance with these Regulations which give effect to the Water Framework Directive.</p><p>  The Water Framework Directive is an overarching Directive that establishes a framework for the management of water resources in the European Union.  It requires, <i>inter alia,</i> the achievement of good ecological status in all surface waters, the definition of which includes both transitional and coastal waters.  As regards environmental objectives, the Water Framework Directive draws no distinction between transitional waters and coastal waters; there is no question of a looser environmental protection associated with the classification of water bodies as either transitional or coastal waters.  The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is one of the basic measures of the Water Framework Directive.</p><p>  Discussions regarding the question of jurisdiction over the Foyle and Carlingford Estuaries are a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I understand these discussions are ongoing.  While resolution of the jurisdictional issues should further assist in the implementation of environmental law, including relevant EU Directives, there is already excellent ongoing cooperation between the authorities in both jurisdictions on matters relating to the environment, many of which are mandated to the North South Ministerial Council established under the British Irish Agreement.</p><p>  The designation of sites under the Ramsar Convention is a matter for my colleague the nister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I understand that Ireland currently has 45 designated sites (almost 67,000 hectares) under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.  I also understand that Ireland&#8217;s priorities and resources in relation to site designations are currently focused on fully implementing the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive and the EU Birds Directive (EU Nature Directives).</p></reply>

KCS was developed by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department.  The document was prepared through a collaborative process, which included consultation with stakeholders, and it was recommended for adoption as national policy by the Management Board of the Directorate.   </p><p>  It is important that there is a common understanding in relation to terminology in risk management, and relevant definitions are set out in KCS.  In particular, the term &#8220;Risk Assessment<b>&#8221;</b> as used in KCS is one stage of the risk management process.  The National Directorate prepared a series of Task Analyses to show how an initial crew of five may be used safely to undertake tasks normally associated with a range of fire scenarios.  The Task Analysis for the Domestic Dwelling fire situation was circulated during the development stage.   </p><p>  Under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation, the phrase &#8216;risk assessment&#8217; has a particular meaning, and requires employers to carry out risk assessments of their work activities.  Guidance on relevant aspects of risk assessment for fire services, and meeting this legislative requirement, is provided in the Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement (generic risk assessments), in the Fire Service National Incident Command System (dynamic risk assessments) and Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs) (specific situational risk assessments).  Individual fire services will prepare any additional risk assessments, based on the Task Analyses referred to above, which may be necessary to comply with their statutory responsibilities as employers on foot of changes arising from implementation of KCS.

KCS was developed by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department through a collaborative process, which included consultation with stakeholders, and it was recommended for adoption as national policy by the Management Board of the Directorate.  There was extensive consultation with stakeholders, including recognised staff representative organisations (SIPTU and IMPACT).  The unions<b></b>have five and two nominees respectively on the National Directorate&#8217;s Consultative Committee.  Specific meetings were held with SIPTU during the consultative process to discuss aspects of their submission on early drafts of the document. </p><p>  Specifically on fire-fighter safety, KCS recognises the importance of the twin duties on fire authorities under the Fire Services and Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation. A Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) support document is being developed as part of the KCS implementation process to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with recently adopted local government SMS policy.  This follows fire service initiatives which have been developed and implemented in recent years which include the Ancillary Safety Statement Template for Fire Services, the National Incident Command System, Guidance on the Use of Breathing Apparatus and Compartment Fire Behaviour training and assessment, as well as an extensive suite of Standard Operating Guidelines.  Under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, employers are required to carry out risk assessments of their work activities. Individual fire services will prepare any additional risk assessments which may be necessary to comply with their statutory responsibilities as employers on foot of changes arising from implementation of KCS.  The document is available on my Department&#8217;s website at .</p></reply>

In distributing Local Property Tax income to local authorities through the Local Government Fund, I will seek to ensure that a significant proportion of the tax is retained in the local authority area in which it is collected in order to fund essential local services in our communities.   </p><p>  Currently, general purpose grants from the local government fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time: that is, a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.  Local authority cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.  A number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.   </p><p>  In time, local authorities may vary the local rate of the Local Property Tax.  This function will strengthen local authority accountability to local taxpayers.  The tax will alter the relationship between the citizen and his or her local authority in a way which will be altogether beneficial for good governance.  As noted in the <i>Action Plan for Effective Local Government, Putting People First</i>, if local elected members have relatively little responsibility for raising revenue, their rigorousness in prioritising its allocation, overseeing its efficient use and stewardship, and oversight in relation to the performance and management of local authority operations, generally, is likely to be diminished.   </p><p>  Currently, local authorities vary in their degree of dependence on the local government fund.  Differences in population densities and settlement patterns will, of course, have an impact on the extent to which a given local authority will be funded by the Local Property Tax.  In accounting terms, the gearing of funding from local authority to local authority will differ and, as such, equalisation measures may be needed to address such variations.</p></reply>

The Irish Presidency will now engage with the European Parliament to seek its assent to the deal agreed by the Council.  In parallel to these discussions, the negotiation processes for the large range of regulatory instruments required to implement the various parts of the MFF will continue. </p><p>  LEADER is supported through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, which is in place to fund measures under Rural Development or the Pillar II element of the CAP.  Under the proposed regulatory framework for the EAFRD for 2014 to 2020 at least 5% of the total EAFRD contribution to each member state's Rural Development Programmes, RDPs, must be reserved for LEADER.  The agreement on the MFF provides for a strong CAP supporting a strong agricultural base in Europe and indicates that the overall EU level of funding for Pillar II is &euro;84,936 million, including the LEADER element.  However, further negotiations are required at EU and national level in order to determine the breakdown of this funding both for Ireland in general and for LEADER in particular.  In this context, a definitive allocation for the LEADER programme for the 2014 to 2020 programming period is not yet available.</p><p>  Recommended changes to the current arrangements for implementing LEADER are set out in the final report of the Local Government/Local Development Alignment Steering Group, and reflected in the Putting People First &ndash; Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  The report recommended that Socio-Economic Committees should have responsibility for planning, management and oversight of local and community programmes, including the matching of resources to priorities and achievement of value for money.  The report also proposed that appropriately structured Socio-Economic Committees would present the optimum structure for implementing LEADER local development strategies for the 2014 to 2020 EU programming period.  I anticipate the continued involvement of local development companies in programme implementation on behalf of my Department.</p></reply>

These are bodies established for the management of such areas, the membership of which comprise the owners of residential units within the development.    </p><p>  As regards service charges, the position is that section 18 of the 2011 Act requires each OMC to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges to fund the costs of insurance, maintenance and other common or shared services.  These service charges, which are not therefore directly related to the value of residential units in the development, must be calculated on a transparent basis, be apportioned on an equitable basis between unit owners and be approved by the owners at a meeting of the OMC.  In summary, the Act gives residential unit owners a direct role in determining the level of annual service charge, the level of services to be funded and the manner in which such services are to be provided.</p><p>  I should add that section 18 also provides that each owner is under an obligation to pay annual service charges and that section 22 provides that unpaid service charges may be recovered by the OMC concerned as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction, that is, normally, the District Court.</p></reply>

He was informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that a declaration of refugee status had been refused in respect of him on 25 January 2010.  An appeal was lodged against the decision of the Commissioner to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal by the Refugee Legal Services Galway on the 10 February 2010.  On 25 August 2010 the Ministerial Decisions Unit informed the applicant that it was proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was informed of the three options now open him including his right to make leave to remain representations, also included was a Subsidiary Protection application form.  This letter was returned marked &#8216;gone away&#8217; on 26 August 2010. </p><p>  A Subsidiary Protection application and representations pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 were made on behalf of the applicant by the Refugee Legal Services Galway on the 9 September 2010.  A personal statement on behalf of the applicant in support of these applications was submitted by the RLS Galway on the 13 September 2010.  The applicant was informed that his application for Subsidiary Protection was refused on 8 August 2011.  He was informed on 30 August 2011 that it had been decided to make a Deportation Order against him.  Judicial Review proceedings challenging both of these decision were brought before the High Court on 24 September 2011 and are currently ongoing.  As the matter is therefore <i>sub judice</i> I do not propose to comment further. </p><p>  Queries regarding the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&#8217;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This work, inter alia, involves providing assessment reports to the Courts and managing completion of the Orders by offenders.  The use of Community Service Orders generally is monitored but the Courts are independent in exercising their functions. </p><p>  The Probation Service prioritises its workload and allocates its resources in such a way as to maximise efficiency and effectiveness.  This prioritisation includes particular focus on the delivery of front-line services and the supervision of Community Service Orders.</p><p>  The Probation Service has restructured the delivery of Community Service nationally under the governance of a dedicated Community Service Unit.  Besides the 9 dedicated administrative and probation staff, there are 78 Probation Officers working nationally with a range of duties including community service.  The Probation Service also engages community service supervisors to manage offenders undertaking community service on work projects.  As at the end of January 2013, there were 40 community service supervisor posts nationwide. The recruitment of an additional 4 supervisors for which sanction was received is ongoing.  It is expected that these posts will be filled shortly. </p><p>  The Fines Act, 2010 included a number of provisions designed to minimise the level of fine default and to ensure as far as possible that fine defaulters are not committed to prison, including the imposition of community service.  Further measures have been drafted in the Fines (Amendment) Bill 2012 which will introduce the attachment of earnings of a person whose fine remains unpaid.  Section 15 is being amended to provide for the payment of fines by instalments as an automatic right rather than having to apply to the Court for the facility.</p></reply>

The ISI will accept applications only after it has made Regulations under Section 161 of the Act for the purposes of the control and supervision of PIPs and the protection of debtors and creditors. It is expected that these Regulations will be made in the near future.  As I have previously stated, I expect that accountants, lawyers and a broad range of financial advisors may wish to seek regulation as practitioners, but it will not be confined to these professions.

By this definition, the vast majority of Travellers/Roma in the Irish State are indigenous Irish Travellers. There are no official statistics on the number of Roma in Ireland. A figure of 3,000 (approximately 0.07% of the population) has been cited by the Roma Support Group Pavee Point. However, the vast majority of Roma in this State are EU citizens and, as such, in terms of immigration controls, are covered by the provision of the European Communities (Free movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. Such persons are not required to register their presence in the State.</p><p>  Ireland's National Traveller/Roma Strategy was developed following a  communication from the EU Commission entitled &ldquo;An EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies&quot; (April 2011) which requested that member states would, in proportion to the size of the Roma population living in their territories and taking into account their different starting points, adopt or develop further a comprehensive approach to Roma integration.This document thus includes relevant strategies that already exist in the four crucial areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing.  It also mentions initiatives in place in the same areas to assist the Roma community who are citizens of the European Economic Area and are legally resident in the country.  It should be noted that Traveller representatives are active participants on National Committees dealing with policy in all four areas and, in this way, were involved in the development of these policies. The Irish Strategy document is envisaged to be a living document and as time goes on there is nothing to prevent the development and inclusion of new actions in any of the sectors; however the actions in the Strategy are at present generic actions in relation to the population covered rather than Roma-specific.</p><p>  My Department's role in the Strategy is one of coordination while the development of particular policy and implementation including targets, timelines and budgets as referred to by the Deputy are a matter for my Government colleagues in the relevant Government Departments.</p><p>  In the Commission's assessment of the National Strategies, Ireland was identified as having a strong monitoring and review mechanism for adapting the strategy. Based on the assessment of all Member States, a set of policy recommendations in each section points to priorities that all Member States should further address, depending on their national circumstances, in order to meet their responsibilities.In this context it is envisaged that further actions will be developed for Ireland when and where it is deemed necessary.</p></reply>

The constitutional protection afforded to the institution of marriage makes the possibility of effective criminal sanctions highly problematic.  However it is intended,  in the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill, which I hope to republish later this year,  to make a number of provisions that would make it more difficult for persons engaging in a marriage of convenience to benefit from it in immigration terms.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection,  is likewise in the process of looking at possible changes to the Civil Registration Act in order to make such marriages more difficult to contract.  These legislative steps should contribute to reducing the incentive to seek to engage in such marriages.</p></reply>

In that regard, instructions have been issued to members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na emphasising the mandatory requirement to breath test drivers at the scene of both fatal and serious injury collisions taking into account the particular circumstances arising in incidents of serious injury.  I can also inform the Deputy that my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I have since received assurances from the Garda authorities that every effort is being made to ensure the relevant legislative provisions are fully complied with.  These measures include communication with all Garda members through a series of instructions and Directives from Garda Headquarters as well as Monthly Tactical Assessments by Garda management on the level of compliance.</p></reply>

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven, and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders. These initiatives optimise the use of existing structures and local Garda management ensure that all personnel are fully briefed on the initiative, with Divisional Crime Management Teams playing a key coordination and implementation role.</p><p>  I am informed that as of 31 January 2013, 3,903 persons have been arrested and 2,142 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.</p><p>  In addition to this specific operation, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime and is directed and supported each year by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Policing Plan.  Each Garda District and Divisional Officer also configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure that an appropriate policing service is delivered to the area in question, whether it be a rural or urban one. The Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including the Joint Policing Committees, and through programmes such as Community Alert which operates in cooperation with the programme partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, and has led to the establishment of 1,345 Community Alert groups countrywide.</p><p>  It is the Government's intention to ensure that frontline policing services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.

These included the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Jones Lang LaSalle, DKM Economic Consultants, Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence Ireland and the Irish Association of Investment Managers.  Some of the views referred to were published by the organisation concerned.  In a very limited number of cases views were made available to me on a confidential basis, and I have no plans to put the latter into the public domain.  Also borne in mind was the content of the considerable volume of correspondence received from individuals and businesses who generally espoused the views of the retail sector.  Additionally, my Department had available to it an economic analysis of possible policy options in relation to the proposal to abolish upward only rent review clauses in existing leases which had been prepared by the Department of Finance and which formed part of the deliberative process in the context of the Government's consideration of the matter.</p></reply>

The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.  </p><p>  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Edenderry Courthouse will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.

Its function is to provide accommodation and related services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.</p><p>In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for international protection and who seek accommodation until such time as they:</p><p>(i)leave voluntarily;</p><p>(ii)are removed - either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer;</p><p>(iii)are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or</p><p>(iv)are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or by way of special scheme such as the 2005 IBC scheme.</p><p>As I previously outlined, I acknowledge that the length of time spent in direct provision is an issue to be addressed and I have taken a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications including redeployment of resources, establishment of a legal panel to assist INIS in processing a cohort of repatriation cases. Further, I plan to republish the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 to create a single procedure for the processing of applications.  These steps will help reduce the time a person spends in direct provision while they await a final decision on their case.</p><p>As I also explained, I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist INIS  in processing a cohort of repatriation cases, thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the direct provision system.  I would expect to see significant dividends, in terms of cases finalised, from this initiative in the coming months.</p></reply>

Under the 2011 Act, any person wishing to engage in the provision of property services must get a licence from the Authority. The types of property service for which a licence is required are: the auction of property other than land; the purchase or sale of land (including buildings or structures on land); the letting of land; and property management services. Section 99 of the 2011 Act provides that persons, who were lawfully providing a property service prior to the coming into effect of the new licensing system on 6 July 2012, could continue to provide such property services pending a determination of their licence application by the Authority.</p><p>  The initial licensing process has been protracted because a very significant proportion of applications were submitted to the Authority with incomplete information or inadequate supporting documentation, requiring extensive correspondence with applicants. However, I am advised by the Authority that in the majority of cases, the applicant has been advised of a decision to either grant or refuse a licence.</p><p>  My Department will be making a request to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for an increase in the personnel assigned to the PSRA, on receipt of a business case based on the outcome of the first licensing round. In the meantime, my Department will continue to monitor the staffing resources available to the Authority to ensure that it is in a position to fulfil its statutory responsibilities.</p></reply>

The standard certification fee is &euro;950 while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of refugees and stateless persons no certification fee is charged.</p><p>  In November 2011, I signed into law Statutory Instrument 569/11, which introduced an application fee of &euro;175 for new applications for a certificate of naturalisation. The application fee was introduced to contribute towards the costs of processing those applications that do not attract any certification fee and to help reduce the proportion of invalid and ineligible applications being lodged. The Statutory Instrument also introduced a series of changes to the application forms, in particular to facilitate applicants who are the civil partners of Irish citizens.</p><p>  The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  As the Deputy will be aware I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.  </p><p>  I have no plans to alter either the application or certification fee at this time.</p></reply>

The Policing Plan outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network.</p><p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to make a final decision on the date of closure of Stepaside Garda Station and I have no function in that regard.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that Stepaside is in the Blackrock District in the Dublin Metropolitan Eastern Division. It is approximately 8 kilometres from the District Headquarters at Blackrock Garda Station and approximately 6 kilometres from Dundrum Garda Station.  As of 31 January 2013, there are 35 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Stepaside Garda Station. The Commissioner has indicated that these members will, insofar as possible, remain in the Blackrock District.  The majority will be allocated to Dundrum Garda Station and some will be allocated to Blackrock Garda Station.</p><p>  The objective of modernising and re-calibrating the Garda station network is to ensure that Garda resources are used in the best and most efficient way possible, in both rural and urban areas, to the benefit of all law-abiding people who reside in this State.  The freeing up of Garda&iacute; from desk duties in Stepaside Garda Station will increase the number of Garda&iacute; available for frontline policing to the benefit of the community there.  Nationally, revised policing arrangements will result in an additional 61,000 operational policing hours in 2013.</p><p>  The implementation of the reduction in the number of Garda stations and Districts will take place in full consultation with the local communities and staffing interests. Local Garda management have engaged and will continue to engage with communities through the Joint Policing Committees and other fora to advise them of the revised policing arrangements following the closure of any particular Garda station. The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided to the public at all times.</p><p>  Decisions in relation to the provision and deployment of both Garda personnel and transport are matters for the Garda Commissioner. Responsibility for the efficient deployment of official Garda vehicles in each Division is assigned to the Divisional Officer, who may allocate vehicles between stations, as required by operational circumstances.  I understand, however, that of the new vehicles coming on stream, 22 of these will be allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  A more detailed breakdown is not currently available and the Deputy will appreciate that a degree of flexibility in allocating and re-allocating vehicles among stations, so as to best match the allocation of resources with policing priorities, is essential to the efficient management of the Garda fleet.</p><p>  The closure of any particular Garda Station will not affect the procedure for the Garda response to emergency calls which will continue as it is at present e.g. in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (which includes Stepaside) the call to 999 or 112 will initially be taken by BT, who operate the Emergency Calls Answering Service, and then, if the emergency requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, referred immediately to the Garda Command and Control Centre in Harcourt Square.  The Command and Control Centre will direct the necessary Garda resources to the location of the emergency.  This is done without reference to a Garda station.</p><p>  In the case of an emergency requiring an urgent Garda response, such as a danger to life or risk of serious injury, a crime in progress or about to happen or an offender still at the scene or just left, members of the public should call 999 or 112.  Other Crimes should be reported directly to the nearest Garda Station.</p></reply>

This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.</p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid him/herself.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion under the Act and the information sought by the Deputy could not be obtained without a disproportionate use of resources.   Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 54,092 criminal legal aid certificates in 2011 and 49,639 in 2012.  More than one certificate may be granted to any one person.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if he/she cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  In addition, Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will appreciate that the criminal legal aid scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  My overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces. </p><p>  The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army is under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment.  These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.  </p><p>  The Military Authorities have advised that these upper age limits have proven suitable for the requirements for a modern Defence Forces which is actively involved in operations at home and on Peace Support Operations overseas. It is their view that an upper age limit for enlistment of 30 years of age would not be suitable to Defence Forces requirements.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the existing upper age requirements for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force are appropriate.</p></reply>

These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions, including welfare aspects, attached to them.  </p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.

This virus causes mild transient disease manifesting as a drop in milk production, fever and sometimes diarrhoea  in adult cattle. When infection occurs in animals that are not pregnant, the impact is very limited. However if ruminant animals are infected during the early stages of pregnancy, they may subsequently abort or give birth to malformed offspring. </p><p>  It would be impractical to attempt midge control measures, except for valuable breeding stock.  Exposure of non-pregnant animals to the virus may, in fact, be beneficial pending the development of an effective vaccine. Exposed animals develop a strong immunity and are unlikely to suffer any ill-effects if exposed to the virus on a subsequent occasion. If this viral infection becomes endemic, the ill-effects are likely to be confined to younger animals and cows and ewes that have not been previously exposed. Based on Australian experience in vaccinating against a similar virus/disease (Akabane virus infection), the expert view is that vaccination is likely to be an effective tool in control of the SBV infection. The development of a vaccine is in progress and my Department will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

In accordance with EU legislation, testing is carried out at farm level and in the primary processing facilities (slaughterhouses) because these are the most suitable locations for testing for the presence of illegal substances. In particular, where an equine has been treated with phenylbutazone (commonly referred to as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;), the positives for residues of the medicine are more likely to be detected in a fresh meat sample rather than a processed meat sample as this substance is not a very stable compound and breaks down quite quickly. Tests are not routinely carried out at secondary processing plants or prepared products. National Residue testing is carried out on an ongoing basis throughout the year at farm and slaughterhouse level with 19,500 tests completed last year.   In addition, primary processors are required to carry out self-monitoring plans for the detection of residues of substances, veterinary medicines and contaminants. </p><p>  With regard to Phenylbutazone (Bute), testing is conducted every year under the NRCP as part of the testing programme for substances in category B2 (e) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Testing for Bute is carried out in samples from bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine animals as well as poultry, farmed game and milk.   In 2011, 12,575 horses were slaughtered and approx 280 equine samples were tested, 58 for Bute.  Final equine slaughter figures are not yet available for 2012 but approximately 330 samples were tested, 104 for Bute. As in the case of residues generally, testing is not routinely conducted on processed or prepared products. </p><p>  One positive sample for phenylbutazone was found under the National Residue Control Plan in 2010 at a level of 10 parts per billion (10ppb).   While the result was above the minimum limit detectable, it was at an extremely low level in terms of human health risk.  A follow up investigation was conducted by DAFM and resulted in an increase in testing of animals presented by the owner of the animal from which the positive sample was derived. No further positives were detected.  </p><p>As agreed at the meeting which I convened last week, it has been agreed at EU level to introduce an EU wide month programme of control measures, including significant testing of samples for bute.  The intention behind the programme is to publish the findings of the first month&rsquo;s testing on 15th   April following their presentation to the Commission, and then review the programme. The results of this control programme would provide an evidence base for the possible consideration of further risk based measures. </p></reply>

In the case of fishery products there are additional requirements in Council Regulation 104/2000 and Commission Regulation EC 2065/2001. These require the provision of more detailed information to consumers on the provenance of fishery and aquaculture products and also to provide greater transparency on the traceability of all fish<font color="#FF0000">. </font>  The Regulations apply only to raw fish and aquaculture products, processed products such as breaded fillets, crab sticks or ready-to-eat dishes are not covered by those Regulations.   The Regulations make it a legal requirement to provide at the point of retail sale the following information: the common name of the species of fish, the production method (whether the fish is caught or farmed) and the catch area (origin), this applies to products sold loose or in a pre-packaged form, traceability information for all food must also be available at each stage of marketing of the product.</p><p>  Responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling legislation in Ireland rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and is discharged by the official agencies who operate under Service Contract to the FSAI, as part of their supervisory role and enforcement activities<font color="#0000FF">. </font>  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), under service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) enforces the Regulations up to the level of wholesale.

Cork; St Peters, Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath and Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary. I have been advised by the HSE that the files have been transferred to the HSE in their entirety.  Queries are being dealt with in the HSE Regional Adoption Department in order that enquirers can be offered a meeting with a social worker/counsellor to deal with requests as promptly as possible. The HSE is responding to individual queries and encourages anyone seeking their personal data to communicate directly with the HSE South Adoption Unit, St Stephens Hospital, Glanmire, Co.Cork (tel. 021 4858650).</p><p>  Work is continuing  in relation to the preparation of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  The proposed Bill will provide for a structured and regulated approach to providing access to adoption information and will facilitate contact for those affected by adoption, including in circumstances where an adoption order was not effected. </p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have access to all adoption records. The Bill will provide for a National Index of Adoption Records to be maintained by the Adoption Authority containing information as to where all known adoption records are located within the State. It is envisaged that only the Authority, the HSE and accredited bodies will hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. </p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis. The purpose of the Register is to allow persons affected by adoption to register their names with a view to receiving information about a person from whom they have been separated as a result of adoption and will allow for registering a preference, as to whether or not,  they want to have contact with that person.  </p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines which will be set out in regulations. It is intended that the Tracing Service will be made available to adopted persons, birth parents and relatives with the Adoption Authority having the overarching responsibility for the service.  </p><p>  Complex issues have arisen during the course of the preparation of the Bill  including the criteria for balancing an adopted person's right to information about his or her identity as against a birth parent's right to privacy. My own view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries. </p><p>  Consideration of legal and policy issues is ongoing and once these have been satisfactorily resolved, I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill. It is my intention to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2013. </p></reply>

However, in circumstances where the service provider has indicated that s/he is no longer in a position to provide the programme to a particular child, for whatever reason, any funding already paid for the provision of the service in respect of a period beyond the date of cessation must be returned to the Department.

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the Agency can be established as soon as possible. The Agency, upon establishment, will assume full statutory responsibility for a range of child and family services currently provided by three separate agencies; namely the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. </p><p>  The Government's consideration of these matters was informed, by the content and recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency which I published in July 2012.  The Task Force considered that the Agency needs to be as broadly based as possible and should include a range of prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  It is my intention that the Agency will have a role in supporting families and communities. I can assure the Deputy that the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade, and that a community based approach will form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency. </p><p>  Funding of over &euro;23.5 million has been provided to the Family Support Agency (FSA) for 2013. This includes a dedicated provision of over &euro;14 million in respect of the Family Resource Centre Programme in 2013. Under the programme some 106 Family Resource Centres will receive funding from the FSA this year. The FSA, like all other State bodies, has been asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers. In this context the Family Resource Centres have been asked to focus, in particular, on identifying the scope for greater efficiency and for reduction in the administration and overhead costs associated with the day-to-day running of the centres.</p><p>  The composition of the Board of the Child and Family Support Agency is currently under consideration. It will reflect the broad ranging nature of the Agency's responsibilities. In line with best corporate governance, the criteria for Board membership will be focused on ensuring that Board members have the requisite mix of experience and competencies needed to steer such a large organisation providing a diverse range of personal services. </p><p>  The establishment of the new Agency and the wider transformation of children's services represents one of the largest, and most ambitious, areas of public sector reform embarked upon by this Government.</p></reply>

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI); the Family Support Agency (FSA); the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.    With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the Children Detention Schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. </p><p>  Apart from the Ombudsman for Children's Office which does not have a board, I am responsible for all Board of Management appointments.</p><p>  Since I took office in March, 2011 there have been 35 appointments to the Boards of Management under the aegis of my Department. </p><p>   As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. My Department&rsquo;s website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>  The appointment of members to each of these bodies is not a competency-based process. The governing legislation in relation to each of these bodies sets out the composition of the Board either in terms of their qualifications and experience, or the Government Minister or body that is responsible for nominating representatives on them or who must be consulted in the nomination process. </p><p>  For example, the Adoption Act, 2010 requires that the Adoption Authority of Ireland consists of 7 members &ndash; the chairperson must be a Judge, barrister or solicitor and the ordinary members must include a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare, child protection or both, a barrister or solicitor with experience in the practice of law in relation to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person with appropriate training in psychology. </p><p>  On the other hand, the Education Welfare Act, 2000 provides that the Minister shall make appointments to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) from among persons who in the opinion of the Minister have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Board. </p><p>   There are also prescribed bodies to be consulted in appointing ordinary members. The Family Support Agency Act, 2001 provides that the Minister may appoint individuals to the Board who have a special interest or expertise in matters relating to the functions of the Agency. Of the 10 people appointed to this Board, 9 of the 10 people were appointed after submitting expressions of interest.  The other person appointed to this Board was a Departmental representative.</p><p>  The Children Act, 2001 outlines the different Ministers and organisations that nominate persons to serve on the board of management of the children detention schools.   </p><p>  In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  </p><p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not made any appointments to any commercial bodies, state owned banks or the judiciary since taking office. </p></reply>

Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.</p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including child care costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive a subsidy of &euro;95 per week towards full-day child care costs.</p><p>  Approximately 19,000 families availed of subvention under the CCS programme in the September 2011-August 2012 period.  The total number of children availing of the service in this period was approximately 26,300 and the cost of providing this service was some &euro;58 million.</p><p>  Approximately 19,500 families are availing of the CCS programme in the current school year at an estimated cost of &euro;50 million.  It is expected that in the region of 26,000 children will again benefit but these figures can only be finalised when an appeals process, provided for under the programme, is completed.</p></reply>

The HSE established an Intern Implementation Group in 2009 to implement aspects of the Report of the NCMET on the Intern Year and I am aware that this Group has issued two Implementation Reports, most recently in April 2012 (Second Interim Report).  The intern year is an integral part of medical training, and a medical practitioner cannot be fully accredited without it.  There were 572 posts available in Ireland for the July 2012 intern intake, an increase of almost 70 posts since 2007. To date, there have been sufficient posts for all EU graduates from Irish medical schools, and a number of available posts for some non-EU applicants. </p><p>  My Department has been in regular contact with the HSE in relation to the issue of intern places, with the aim, in so far as is possible, of providing a sufficient number of intern places for Irish/EU graduates from Irish medical schools.  In addition, under EU law, intern posts must be open to graduates from other EU countries and the HSE has no control over the numbers applying.</p><p>  The application process for internships closed in November last, but the HSE will not know the final number of eligible applicants for some time. The final numbers that will proceed to the first round match have not yet been determined, as the overseas candidates must pass the entrance test, meet the HSE English language requirements, provide a Basic Life Support (BLS) certificate, and pass their final year medical exams. Candidates applying from within Ireland must provide a BLS certificate and pass their final year medical exams.</p><p>  This year the HSE will have approximately 80 additional posts available for interns commencing their training in July. In total, therefore, there will be in the region of 650 places available for 2013, and the HSE is confident that there will be sufficient capacity and funding to ensure that every EU graduate of the six Irish medical schools can access an internship.</p></reply>

Through the framework of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, the Department of Health is working in collaboration with the relevant statutory agencies to monitor the availability of controlled drugs, including prescription medicines, through illicit channels.</p><p>  The enforcement of the law relating to the sale of drugs, including prescription drugs, continues to be a priority in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling the issue of drug misuse in this jurisdiction.</p><p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription, and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.</p><p>  Furthermore, a person who has in his possession a prescription medicine containing a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation for the purpose of selling or otherwise supplying it, is guilty of an offence under that legislation.</p><p>  As a result of consultations with key stakeholders, draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations are currently being prepared.  These will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly and comments will be invited to be made in the subsequent two-week period.</p><p>  Following this, it will be necessary to seek Government approval to notify the proposed regulations to the EU Commission and other Member States under the Technical Standards Directives because of the implications of the proposed regulatory changes on trade in pharmaceutical products.</p><p>  Subject to successful completion of the EU notification period, which may take up to 3 months, it is anticipated that the new regulations will be introduced in mid-2013.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Commission has noted in working papers that the possibility of any future changes does not mean it will not pursue compliance with present EU law where necessary.</p><p>  The Government is committed to achieving compliance with the Directive in respect of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) by 2014. I have emphasised to the Health Service Executive the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.</p><p>  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by NCHDs with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by NCHDs to other grades and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.</p><p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2013 states that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce. The Executive is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan. is will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken in relation to EWTD compliance. The HSE was asked by my Department in January to ensure that clear responsibility is placed with a hospital CEO and a senior manager and/or clinical lead for the achievement of specified improvements in compliance, such that the end 2014 target will be met.</p></reply>

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out </i>the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.  Area 15 of<i> Reach Out </i>deals with marginalised groups including Travellers.</p><p>  Suicide within the traveller community was shown to be a major problem by the findings of the All-Ireland Traveller Health Study which was published in 2010.  This study determined that in 2007 the suicide rate among male Traveller was 6.6 times that of the general population while for female Travellers it was shown to be 4.9 times higher than the general population.</p><p>  There has been a significant amount of work done with Traveller groups, providing information, conducting training and developing resources.  The National Traveller Suicide Awareness Project (NTSAP) is a collaboration of Traveller organisations, the National Office for Suicide Prevention and Exchange House.  This project is funded by the National office for Suicide Prevention and has been in operation since 2007 to respond to the issue of Traveller suicide.  The project works directly with approx. 500 Travellers per year and indirectly to others through networking at national, regional and local events, and also provides preventative and post suicide supports.  The aim is to develop and implement a community development approach to addressing the issue of suicide in the Traveller community by; acting as a resource both to Traveller organisations and suicide related services in terms of raising their awareness on the issue of suicide in the Traveller community; promoting the development of initiatives to support suicide prevention, intervention and interventions after suicide situations, in a co-ordinated manner and, in so doing, to reduce the number of attempted and completed suicides in the Traveller community.</p><p>  The project aims to reduce the number of Traveller suicides over the next 10 years through the following actions:</p><p>  - Collate up to date data on Travellers who die by suicide and the services available to Travellers and their uptake;</p><p>  - Develop prevention, intervention and interventions after suicide initiatives with Travellers using a community development approach and based on the data collated and the experience of the project to date;</p><p>  - Effect positive policy and social change in the area of Traveller suicide;</p><p>  - Carry out NTSAPs planned work in a timely, efficient and effective manner.</p><p>  Traveller men who have in the past been reluctant to engage with services and two male project workers were recruited in September 2011 with the role of working with Traveller men nationally to focus on engaging Traveller men as well as providing ongoing support to groups in developing appropriate responses to address the identified needs.  In addition bereavement support and the development of more meaningful relationships with mental health services have been addressed.  Overall 14 men&#8217;s groups received funding in 2012.  Networking and awareness raising were carried out and Traveller men did engage with the services.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.</p><p>  The person's contribution towards the cost of their care is calculated based on 80% of their income (which would include any rental income) and 5% of their assets per annum. If the person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets. It was announced in Budget 2013 that the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  The legislation underpinning the Scheme must be amended before this change can take effect.</p><p>  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:</p><p>  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</p><p>  1. The first &euro;36,000 for a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment.</p><p>  2. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care. This three year cap can also apply to family farms/businesses in certain circumstances.</p><p>  3. Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the scheme.</p><p>  4. Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p>  5. If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.  </p><p>6. Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.</p><p>  7. There is a financial review mechanism which takes account of the fluctuating value of assets and the fact that cash assets will naturally deplete over time as payments are made to the nursing home etc.</p><p>  If a person avails of the Nursing Home Loan, the money advanced by way of the loan must be repaid as follows:</p><p>- If the repayment arises because of the death of the person in care, it must be repaid within 12 months of the date of death. Otherwise interest will apply from the date of death. </p><p>- If the repayment arises because the property is sold/transferred during the person in care&rsquo;s lifetime, it must be repaid within 6 months of the date of the sale/transfer, otherwise interest will apply back to that date.</p><p>  If a person's principal residence is sold (whether or not they are availing of the Nursing Home Loan), the proceeds of the sale are treated as cash assets and would not be subject to the three year cap. Cash assets are currently taken into account at 5% per annum for as long as the person remains in nursing home care.  </p><p>  The Scheme includes a five year anti-avoidance mechanism, i.e. any income or assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  This is necessary in order to ensure that the scheme is fair to all and financially sustainable.  </p><p>  It is not clear from the details supplied who is the applicant in the case referred to by the Deputy. I would, therefore, suggest that the individuals in question contact their local Nursing Homes Support Office which will answer any queries the have about the Scheme. A list of the Nursing Homes Support Offices is available on the HSE's website at: .</p></reply>

While no dedicated programme for simultaneous or sequential cochlear implantation is being carried out in Ireland at this time, some bilateral implantation has already occurred for patients, mainly very young children with certain medical conditions such as a history of meningitis or blindness. 	</p><p>  It is estimated that there are approximately 200 children in Ireland today who may be suitable for a second implant. Not all suitable patients proceed with the second implant when appraised of all the issues involved.</p><p>  I am aware that Beaumont Hospital, HSE Management and the HSE&rsquo;s Audiology Clinical Care Programme have met recently to discuss a joint process to identify the options for developing and resourcing a programme of simultaneous and sequential cochlear implantation. An important element of this will be the development of clear clinical criteria to prioritise clients for assessment and follow on implantation.   The introduction of this service is a matter between the HSE and Beaumont hospital and the HSE has advised me that  these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 estimates process.</p></reply>

Charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme.  </p><p>  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</p><p>  There is no provision, under the prescription charge legislation, to accommodate persons who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of the prescription charge.</p></reply>

The Rapid Access clinics are led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs).

In regard to the planned EMU at Beaumont, I am advised by the HSE that, having secured recruitment approval from the National Control Group, Beaumont is progressing the recruitment  of  the posts necessary to support the service development. The recruitment of the necessary nursing personnel is a key element to facilitate phased opening of the unit  as nursing staff come into post. </p><p>  With regard to Cork, the HSE has advised that it is the intention of the Cork University Hospital management to open the EMU in Quarter 3 of this year and this will be included in the HSE South&rsquo;s 2013 Regional Service Plan.</p></reply>

Blood, and the products derived from it, are an integral facet of health care delivery. A major objective of the organisation is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the donors of blood and recipients of blood and blood products. </p><p>  The EU Directive on quality and safety of blood requires that &quot;all necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the health of individuals who are recipients of blood and blood components&quot;. The permanent deferral of men who have sex with men [MSM] of whom a significant majority consider themselves to be gay by the IBTS, is an important safety measure for blood transfusion. e decision is not based on sexuality or orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland.   </p><p>  Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective but there remains a period between infection and detection that could permit the transmission to a recipient.  The medical literature contains well documented examples in the immediate past.  Although no transfusion transmitted infection anywhere is ever acceptable, in Ireland this is considered to be especially so given past experience.  The IBTS works closely with other blood services in Europe and America where this permanent deferral is retained.  Indeed, almost no developed country has no deferral period, and will all exclude sexually active gay men from donation. </p><p>  The UK modified their exclusion criteria to introduce a finite 12 month deferral for MSM behaviour in 2011.  Since then the IBTS has reviewed formally its position and this has been ratified by its Medical Advisory Committee and Board.  With regard to supply, there is a clear distinction to be made between transfusion safety and blood supply.  Safety cannot be compromised by supply concerns.  In addition, the number of donations likely to be obtained from MSM is unlikely to resolve any supply issues.</p></reply>

A person may also access required supports in the community and it is recognised that a modern mental health service is best delivered in a community setting.  In 2012 a special allocation of &euro;35m was provided to primarily strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services and Budget 2013 provided a further &euro;35m for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings including the further ongoing development of community services.</p><p>  Reach Out, Our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention highlights the fact that alcohol and substance misuse are strongly related to deliberate self harm and suicidal behaviour.   In order to counteract the harm caused by the use and misuse of alcohol, real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report, which was published last year. Following consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and liaison with other Departments, my colleague, Minister of State Alex White T.D., intends to introduce specific proposals for consideration by the Government as soon as possible. </p><p>  The Mental Health Act 2001 sets out the criteria for involuntary admission to approved centres.  Subject to certain safeguards, a person may be involuntarily admitted to an approved centre and detained there on the grounds that he or she is suffering from a mental disorder.  Section 8(2) of the Act is clear, however, that an involuntary admission cannot be authorised by reason only of the fact that the person is 'socially deviant' or 'addicted to drugs or intoxicants'.  That does not mean that a person in either of these categories cannot be involuntarily admitted to or detained in an approved centre but for this to happen, the person must be deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder as defined in the Act. </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Steering Group set up to conduct an initial Review of the Mental Health Act 2001, published it's Interim Report in June 2012.  A copy of the Report is available on my Department's website at 'http://www.dohc.ie/publications/int_report_sg_reviewMHA.html'.  During their consultation process, the Group received many representations regarding the detention process set out in the Act.  The Group have recommended, inter alia, that a person should be detained for treatment as a last resort and that the Act should be underpinned by the least restrictive principle, stressing that the patient should not be detained longer than is absolutely necessary.

It is described as a spectrum disorder that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe. The first signs of autism may appear as developmental delay before the age of 3. Many individuals with autism due to the complexity of their presentation may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, current Government policy advocates a mainstreaming approach to the provision of services and supports for people with disabilities including those with autism, whereby people with  disabilities have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate supports and interventions to address individual needs.</p><p>  The HSE completed a review of the autism services provided by the health sector for both children and adults with autism in 2012. Its <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report,</i>   reviews and identifies appropriate pathways of care for individuals with autism, given the existing diverse system of delivering services and varied approaches across the health sector. It recommends a move to a more consistent model of service delivery in line with the Government&#8217;s mainstreaming policy of equal access for people with a disability to the appropriate service for their individual needs. It also recommends a reconfiguration of existing service provision, with access at the appropriate level, depending on need, through the primary care system, school age teams, and specialist intervention services as appropriate. It endorses the reorganisation of services for children and young people under the  Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.  </p><p>  This Programme, established since 2010, aims to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services, so that there is a clear pathway for all children to the services they need regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability or developmental delay. The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised. Implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children, including those with autism, who require access to health related supports.</p><p>  The National Review of Autism Services<i></i>  Report will be implemented, within existing resources and taking account of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the current climate, and within the context of parallel initiatives including the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services published in July 2012 and the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18) Programme.</p></reply>

However, given the multitude of processing centres across the HSE, and indeed within its individual units, in order to meet a 15 day period, it would require the introduction of a single financial and procurement system. Whilst there are plans in this regard, it will be some time before this is in place. Taking into account that over 7,000 invoices are received daily by the Executive across a multiplicity of service delivery units, it has consistently been my Department's view that it is not logistically possible to apply the 15 day payment rule to the HSE at this time. </p><p>  There are significant cost implications in achieving the 15 day target and it has been estimated that it would have an &euro;80m impact on the HSE's cash flow. Given the current severe pressure on the HSE's finances achieving 100% compliance would have a serious impact on services.</p></reply>

In this regard the HSE's National Clinical Programme for Blood Transfusion has reviewed services nationally for haemochromatosis patients with a view to providing a service that reflects best international practice in terms of patient care and value for money. I understand that discussions are ongoing with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and other relevant parties such as GPs to examine options for the improved care of haemochromatosis patients and I look forward to hearing the outcome of these discussions. </p></reply>

Prevention of HCAIs and infection of hospital patients with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (AMR) is a key patient safety and clinical quality initiative for the Irish health care service.The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) / HSE Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIshas established a national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR. The overall aim of the programme is that every health care worker and all parts of the health care system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAI and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance and that our health care systems have processes in place to ensure safe health care is reliable delivered irrespective of the health care setting.</p><p>  The clinical programme's remit includes the development of national clinical guidelines, provision of patient and public information on HCAIs, campaigns on hand hygiene, hospital and community antibiotic prescribing, prevention of medical device related infections, inter-sectoral AMR control and the continuing development of bloodstream infection surveillance in conjunction with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).</p><p>  Recent publication of 14 hospital hygiene inspection reports by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under its National Infection Prevention and Control Standards indicate general satisfaction with hygiene compliance but underline improvements required in certain facilities.HIQA will conduct further inspections during 2013 in a subset of these facilities and the relevant hospitals will continue to be supported in implementing quality improvement plans to further comply with the Standards. Additional hospitals will also be inspected.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures in place to control and prevent HCAIs and AMR in health facilities are yielding the required results (for example the drop of 55% in MRSA rates in the last six years) and that ongoing work programmes will continue to address this central challenge for all health service providers. At present, the Health and Information Quality Authority's remit does not extend to the private sector.Officials of my Departmentare currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers.The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made in the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation.It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised in the near future.</p></reply>

There is a growing appreciation that streets should not just be transport corridors, but rather should be places in which people want to live and spend time. To that end, my Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, is sponsoring the preparation of a Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets. The Manual will outline practical design measures to support and encourage more sustainable travel patterns in urban areas. It is currently being finalised and it is intended to launch the Manual on the 25<sup>th</sup>   of March.</p><p>   The Deputy might wish to note that under my Department&#8217;s Smarter Travel Areas initiative, Limerick City, Dungarvan and Westport have officially become Ireland&#8217;s Smarter Travel Demonstration Areas 2012-2016 representing a city area, medium-sized town and small town. The three areas will see a combined investment of &#8364;23 million to encourage a behavioural switch to more sustainable forms of transport. In addition, under the Active Travel Towns funding programme initiated by my Department in 2012, small grants have been made available to 30 towns to develop walking and cycling strategies and over &#8364;5.2m has been allocated to local authorities to deliver Active Travel strategies in 12 towns.</p><p>   Monitoring and research undertaken by the National Transport Authority in support of sustainable transport objectives are matters that fall within the remit of the NTA. I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply with regard to the second section of the question. Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

For SPSV drivers who own and exclusively operate their own vehicle this is a once-off notification until the vehicle is changed. Where a SPSV is the subject of rental or other sharing  arrangement all changes in the driver operating the vehicle - however frequent - must be notified to the NTA.</p><p>  I understand that free IT tools are availble to facilitate this notification process, The &quot;Taxi Industry Portal&quot; smartphone application can be downloaded onto both Apple and Android smartphones. In addition, SPSV operators can use any PC or laptop to access the Taxi Portal over the Internet.</p><p>   A call centre is currently operating all-day every-day to take telephone notifications.  A call to the centre is charged as a national number from landlines and mobile phones and is included in bundles of free calls from the various companies / operators.  The call centre is operated by the NTA and I have therefore asked the Authority to respond directly to the Deputy with regard to the issues he has raised relating to access to the call-centre. </p></reply>

In doing so I have sought able candidates  with experience or qualifications in finance (including audit capability and/or project assessment), law, corporate governance, marketing, IT, or  with experience relevant to the transport, tourism and sports sectors. </p><p>  I stated clearly that, given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments would not necessarily be confined to those who had made such an expression of interest.  I may also decide from time to time not to fill all existing vacancies. All appointments from 8th April 2011 have followed these procedures. </p><p>  In summary, I have made a total of 96 appointments and 42 re-appointments since March 2011 and a number of other appointments are in the process of being made at the moment. Of the 96, 45 (47%) were from persons who had availed of the opportunity to submit an expression of interest.</p><p>  Also under the new procedures, all new Chairpersons appointed by me have appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee prior to their appointment taking effect. </p><p>  There have been two exceptions where the individual concerned did not appear before the Oireachtas Committee. They were the appointment of Professor Cecily Kelleher as Chairperson of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in April 2012 as this is primarily a technical post, and the appointment in July 2011 of Tom Wall as Chairperson of the Railway Procurement Agency to April 2012 as this was an interim appointment pending the merger of the RPA with the National Roads Authority.</p><p>  To date, the Chairpersons of the following bodies have appeared before the Oireachtas Committee prior to their appointment/re-appointment: </p><p>Road Safety Authority;</p><p>National Roads Authority;</p><p>Railway Procurement Agency;</p><p>Dublin Aviation Authority;</p><p>Shannon Airport Authority;</p><p>Shannon Foynes Port Company;</p><p>Marine Casualty Investigation Board;</p><p>Drogheda Port Company;</p><p>Galway Harbour Company;</p><p>New Ross Port Company;</p><p>Wicklow Port Company; and</p><p>National Sports Campus Development Agency.</p><p>  In addition, the Chairpersons of the CIE companies were appointed on the 29th of June 2011. They did not appear before the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee until the 12th of July 2011 as the Committee was newly established at that point. </p><p>  All future appointments will continue to be made in this fashion.</p></reply>

To this end national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA) with effect from 1st   April 2012, putting such services in a broader transport context.  I also established the National Integrated Rural Transport (NIRT) Committee in April 2012, comprising key stakeholders and chaired by the NTA, to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. </p><p>  I am very aware of the very valuable work done on the ground by the RTP Groups in ensuring that the transport needs of their local community are being identified and delivered within available resources. However, given  resources are limited and that the Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published last year, recommended organisational restructuring to achieve efficiencies and the establishment of better alignment between the RTP groups and local authorities, it is necessary that the current delivery mechanisms and structures are examined and revised. </p><p>   The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved. If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline. I am not prepared to allow that to happen. </p><p>  Work is underway to determine the optimal structure for the delivery of rural transport from an efficiency and service perspective. Discussions are taking place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the County and City Managers Association and the Rural Transport Network in the context of aligning the new structure with the local authority structure. The NIRT Committee is also being kept appraised of developments. I am hopeful that agreement on the revised structure can be achieved in the second half of this year.</p><p>  I want to emphasise however that any future structure for the rural transport programme will be based on community input, local flexibility and involving the voluntary sector.  Rural Transport by its nature is community-based and this will remain under any new structure.</p></reply>

In relation to electric ramps the company advise that due to the variability of the interfaces between trains and platforms (including curved platforms, platforms of different heights) the only possible option for electric ramps is for them to be permanently fitted on board trains.  In effect due to their complexity this would require that they are  built into the train when it is first constructed.<font color="#1F497D"> </font>  The company is committed to such a requirement when ordering new rolling stock in the future.  </p><p>  I am also informed by Irish Rail that they are in discussions with the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) regarding the use of Killester Station by wheelchair users.

Many of the details of these remedies have been reported in the media and as reported, they do not satisfy the Government's concern about connectivity, competition or employment. The Government has made this point on a number of occasions, including in my public statement of the 12th of February 2013.</p><p>  Promoting competition among airlines serving the Irish market is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s aviation strategy and the continued presence of at least two strong competing airlines serving Ireland&rsquo;s air transport needs is regarded as important. At the moment, we are fortunate to have two very strong and profitable airlines operating in Ireland and the competitive dynamic between the two companies has brought significant benefits for Irish consumers.  The Government wants to see continued competition in the market.</p><p>  The deadline for the European Commission's decision in this case is March 6th.  Notwithstanding recent media reports of the outcome of the Commission's investigation, the Government awaits the Commission's formal decision which we expect in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The initiative captures public and media attention across the world generating positive publicity for Ireland and helping create a supportive backdrop against which Tourism Ireland can roll out its targeted marketing programmes. Amongst the landmarks going green this year are the pyramids of Giza, the Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio De Janeiro, the Sydney Opera House and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. More details can be found on Tourism Ireland's website.  In addition, all opportunities to promote Ireland as a tourist destination will be availed of during the programme of overseas Ministerial visits during the St. Patrick's Day period with a particular focus on The Gathering Ireland 2013.</p><p>  With regard to the domestic market, this year's St. Patrick's festival will again aim to showcase all that is best about Ireland and deliver lasting memories for the 1.6 million people who engage with the festival annually. The theme of this year's Dublin parade is &quot;Great Things Happen When We Get Together&quot; and the &quot;Peoples Parade&quot; means that several thousand people from around the world will lead the parade.  </p><p>  In addition and given that 2013 is the year of The Gathering, I am, in conjunction with Minister of State Brian Hayes, encouraging a wide programme of &quot;greening&quot; of public buildings at home. I have also invited my Ministerial colleagues, local authorities, bus and rail companies and airports to green prominent buildings in their care and the Gathering Team are disseminating the concept through their network across the country. A number of high profile buildings have been confirmed already and, together with Minister of State Hayes, I hope to make an announcement on the subject over the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

All ferry companies servicing these routes are commercial companies and, as such, their services are market driven. </p><p>  Competition in the sector is encouraged and I expect services to develop and expand to meet any increased market demands in the future.  In the past, ferry operators have responded to market developments and increased capacity, when required. My Department through its agency, the IMDO, works closely with all existing operators and continues to promote Ireland as a location for new services. </p><p>  The Irish ferry market is also a very important element of the Irish tourism transport network. While the vast majority of our overseas visitors arrive in Ireland by air, research has shown that visitors coming to Ireland by car are very important to our tourism industry as they tend to stay longer, they tend to tour around more (with consequential benefits for regional tourism) and they tend to spend more than those arriving by air. Accordingly, the state tourism agencies have continually targeted this segment. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a particularly important year for Irish tourism with The Gathering Ireland 2013 now underway and over 3,000 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to people overseas that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland. In this regard the agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer. This activity will continue through 2013. </p></reply>

The hosting of major sports events can provide a great showcase for Ireland, drive international visitor numbers and the media coverage of sports tourism events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination. </p><p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the sports tourism sector and in 2012 the Volvo Ocean Race returned to Ireland with its finale in Galway, D&uacute;n Laoghaire hosted the ISAF Youth World Sailing Championship, the Tall Ships and the Bavaria Motor Racing Exhibition event took place in Dublin as well as the Navy-Notre Dame American Football game in the Aviva Stadium.  Tourism Ireland also rolled out a busy programme of promotional activity to target a wide range of potential visitors in the run-up to and during the Olympic Games.  </p><p>  I am supportive of the ongoing efforts of the State Tourism Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support.  On the sporting side, athletes from over thirty countries travelled to Ireland in 2012, for training or participation in Olympic/Paralympic related events before the London Games.  I am aware of a number of sporting events taking place around the country during the year of The Gathering Ireland 2013,details of which are included on the Gathering website.</p></reply>

This is the first step in terms of overall agreement which will now require the consent of the European Parliament. The political agreement on the budget includes overall expenditure ceilings for  various overarching subheads. The agreed Framework does not give a detailed breakdown of financial allocations for smaller programmes and sector specific allocations for areas such as tourism will depend on the more detailed negotiations under the various legislative acts covered by the MFF package.</p><p>  In terms of our position in these discussions, obviously it is our view that tourism as a highly important sector at national and EU level should be appropriately recognised in the specific sectoral programmes. Our priority will continue to be that any future tourism measures at EU level should be clearly additional to national efforts and should have a clear impact on the tourism industry here.  It is likely that tourism can benefit from a range of different EU programmes, with rural development (which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine) likely to be of particular benefit to tourism in Ireland.  Other possible areas which may support tourism include regional and employment measures and also a proposed programme for the competitiveness of Enterprises and SME&rsquo;s (the so called COSME proposal), which may include some  tourism-specific measures and for which my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is primarily responsible.  Our position is that we will look at all tourism measures under the MFF in the round and ensure that all appropriate opportunities to benefit the Irish tourism industry are availed of.</p></reply>
