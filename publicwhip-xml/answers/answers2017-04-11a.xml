    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100059#WRA01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 50 and 70 together. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, my Department provides a range of activation supports and programmes catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.  These include programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.</p>  <p>  These schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  This has to be the ultimate aim.  </p>  <p>  While the live register is falling, the level of support for work programmes has been maintained.  The number of participants on work programmes rose from 25,000 in 2010 and, at the end of December 2016, was just over 32,000.  The OECD has noted previously that Ireland was slow to reduce numbers on work programmes when unemployment fell and employment grew. </p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Department undertook a comprehensive review of CE and other employment schemes.  Overall, it is planned to maintain the overall number of scheme places available in 2017 at 32,000 and CE will account for the bulk of these places.  In addition, the changes to be made over the coming months will widen the range of people who can take part in CE and this will improve the availability of people for the schemes which should help to address problems with filling vacancies.</p>  <p>  Currently, participants can remain on T&uacute;s for 1 year and I have no plans to change this.  </p>  <p>The Government is very mindful of the large number of places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.  In advance of implementing the changes consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated in the coming weeks.   </p></reply>

This includes situations where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide his or her services to an employer but who, though classified as self-employed, is dependent on, and under the control of, a single employer.  It has been suggested that in some cases these type of arrangements may suit both the employer and the worker concerned but that in other cases employers use the arrangements to the detriment of workers.  In both cases, if the arrangement does in fact constitute bogus self-employment, it results in reduced income tax and social insurance contributions.  This is something that neither I nor the Minister for Finance are prepared to allow to continue.</p>  <p>  Having said that it also has to be recognised that new, and legitimate, forms of working arrangements are emerging as the labour markets adapt to the opportunities presented by digitalisation, broadband communications and globalisation.  This includes the emergence of more freelance type working arrangements - known as the gig economy - as well as new forms of trading - known as the sharing economy.  While it is important that policy adapts to provide social protection for workers in these new and emerging forms of work it is equally important that it does not unnecessarily stifle social innovation.  We have to be careful therefore in the steps that we take to tackle the issues that are arising and it is for this reason that we held the public consultation - to gather views of interested parties and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals.  The working group is preparing a report which will present the views of these organisations and individuals, together with an analysis of the issues arising.  I understand that the working group is currently finalising the report.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the report and I will then consider, along with my colleague the Minister for Finance, what changes might be required.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100059#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 86 together.</p>  <p>  Community Employment (CE) Supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector.  The period for which a CE Sponsor contracts with the Supervisor is, therefore, a matter between those two parties. In general, it is important that supervisor contracts reflect that the positions are subject to continued funding from the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Supervisors (and participants) are excluded from the Section 9 provisions of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 as they are &ldquo;employees with a contract of employment which has been concluded within the framework of a specific public or publicly-supported training, integration or vocational retraining programme&rdquo; under Section 2 of this Act.  This means contracts for CE Supervisors cannot be of indefinite duration.</p>  <p>  Given that CE Supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector, the State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for such employees even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  It is open to individual CE supervisors to make provision for a pension by way of PRSA which all employers are obliged to facilitate. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should be aware that the issue of CE Supervisors&rsquo; pension provision is currently being looked at by a Community Sector High Level Forum which has been  convened by the Department of Public Expenditure.  My Department is represented on this group, as are IMPACT and SIPTU, the Department of Environment and Pobal.  The Forum last met on 7 April, 2017 and I understand their work is ongoing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100059#WRA02200"><p>Maternity leave is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Maternity Benefit is paid by my Department for the duration of statutory maternity leave and is based on payment of PRSI contributions while working.</p>  <p>  The current entitlement to maternity leave is 26 weeks paid with 16 weeks additional unpaid maternity leave also available.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to increasing paid parental leave in the first year of birth.  Legislation currently provides for the postponement of maternity leave for up to six months when the child is hospitalised.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure or an urgent needs payment (UNP) to people who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources where no alternative is available. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Deputies Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan tabled a Private Members Motion which was discussed by the D&aacute;il on Wednesday 5 April 2017.  The motion called on the Government ~"to extend the period of statutory maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies, by the length of time between the delivery date of the baby and either the date the baby would have been delivered if full-term or the date of the baby leaving hospital, whichever is later".</p>  <p>  The Government did not oppose the motion, but in responding, signalled our intention to address the substantive issue in the context of the Family Leave Bill, which is being developed by my colleague Ms. Frances Fitzgerald T.D., T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  My Department will be consulting closely with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health and others in the formulation of precise legislative proposals.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.25.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100059#WRA02400"><p><i>54.</i> To ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection his views on the fact that changes to the contributory State pension introduced in 2012 will result in tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of workers, receiving in some circumstances, a pension of 60% below the full contributory State pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[17756/17]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100059#WRA02500"><p>The current rate bands applying to the State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing the rates introduced in 2000.  The new rate bands reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person more closely, although alternative payments are available for those with small additional means.  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands would cost at least &euro;60 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  Since the new rate bands came into effect, less than 2% of new contributory pensioners are paid a contributory pension at the minimum 40% rate of &euro;95.20.  Four years after their introduction, this has amounted to 2,000 pensioners, and so it will in no way reach the levels suggested in the question.</p>  <p>  Most people with a yearly average of 10-14 contributions may qualify instead for a non-contributory pension, the maximum rate of which is &euro;227, or 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Over 70% of these are paid at the full rate.  If someone does not qualify at a rate greater than &euro;95.20, it is because they have been assessed as having household means in excess of &euro;160, in addition to their State pension.  </p>  <p>  Otherwise, they may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult on their spouse's state pension, based on their personal means.  This is up to &euro;213.50, or 90% the rate of the contributory pension, and over 80% of recipients are paid at that full rate.  For such a person to be paid more on a 40% contributory pension, they would have to have additional personal means of more than &euro;118 per week.</p>  <p>  Those who receive a 40% rate pension are generally, therefore, among the minority of pensioners with very significant household and personal means.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include the JobPath service and employment programmes such as the Community Employment (CE) scheme and T&uacute;s.  It is worth highlighting that CE and T&uacute;s have always been outsourced to private providers.</p>  <p>  JobPath aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment.</p>  <p>  CE and T&uacute;s schemes are a stepping stone back to employment but are not full-time sustainable jobs.  People who have completed their year long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE or a T&uacute;s scheme after they have been assessed by a Departmental case officer.</p>  <p>  In general, people are not allowed participate in two separate schemes at the same time.   Given the need to manage the allocation of places to all schemes in an effective manner, my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  However, I recently announced changes which will widen the range of people who can take part in CE, including reducing the entry age to 21 and giving a second opportunity to people who have already taken part.  These changes will be rolled out following a consultation process with stakeholders in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that the work being done through programmes like CE and T&uacute;s is highly valued and recognised by Government and I believe that the changes I have outlined will affirm this. </p></reply>

Employment is central to independence and social integration and offers the best protection against poverty.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to helping more people with disabilities to enter the workforce and move from welfare to work.  My Department provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities, which are voluntary in nature.</p>  <p>  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, which is targeted at employers to encourage employment of people with disabilities and the EmployAbility service, which supports people with disabilities who wish to work through the provision of a dedicated job coach. My Department also provides a range of grants under the reasonable accommodation fund, which comprises employment supports to assist people with disabilities to access and retain employment, and the partial capacity benefit payment. The combined cost of these programmes is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The overall direction of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving the employment rate of people with disabilities is outlined in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for people with disabilities. Under the CES, my Department has responsibility for a range of commitments, which seeks to address the multiple barriers faced by people with disabilities in obtaining and retaining employment. </p>  <p>  As part of delivering the CES, an interdepartmental group was set up to identify any significant disincentives for people with disabilities in taking up or returning to work. Just last week, this group published its findings in the report, &ldquo;Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities&rdquo;. The report sets out 24 key recommendations aimed at improving the employment and retention of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  At the launch of the report, I announced that some of the recommendations are already being acted upon. The first change is that people on a long-term disability payment, including disability allowance, will be able to keep their Free Travel Pass for five years after taking up work. This goes beyond the report&rsquo;s own recommendation of three years. The Department is also launching a protocol to allow people to return to disability allowance seamlessly if work doesn&rsquo;t work out within a year.  Implementation of these recommendations and those assigned to other Government Departments and agencies will make a real difference to people with disabilities and help them to achieve their employment ambitions and economic independence. </p>  <p>  The full report, as well as Easy to Read and Plain English versions, is published and available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.welfare.ie </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It aims to do this by restructuring the governance arrangements from 93 local company boards to a reduced 16 regional company board model.  This will allow resources to be redirected from the current heavy administrative burden to front line service delivery.  The changes will be at local company board level only and no closures or changes will occur at service delivery points.  In other words, the frontline services provided by Citizens Information Services (CIS) and Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) will continue to operate as they do currently regardless of changes implemented at board level.</p>  <p>  The Board fully acknowledges the tremendous contributions that members of local boards have made to the development of CIS and MABS companies over the years, and appreciates that some of these individuals are keen to continue playing an active role.  In recognition of this, and to continue to encourage this ethos, CIB plans to set up Local Advisory Groups.  In addition, current local board members will be able to go forward for selection as members of the new regional boards.</p>  <p>  The reduced company model will better support direct engagement with and by CIB, to implement new initiatives consistently, and facilitate greater interaction with fewer boards.  This in turn will deliver faster responses to the modern day needs of service users.  Those availing of CIS and MABS services will be assured that where they live does not impact on the level or quality of service they receive. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  The new model will better assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, its compliance with the Code of Practise for Governance of State Bodies, and implementation of recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports). </p>  <p>  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  The planned structural  changes in no way threaten the continuing access to, or extent of, information and assistance provided by locally based front line services to those who need it.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single person and &euro;40 for a couple.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs to ensure that the payments under the scheme target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or income increase.  Income from employment and family income supplement (FIS) in excess of the standard SWA weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable (vouched weekly rent or mortgage costs of up to this amount are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment payable). Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, it is assessed under rent supplement using the formula as outlined.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the conditions of the rent supplement scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.  </p></reply>

The tax and social welfare system is continually reviewed, in the budgetary process and otherwise, in terms of its impact in redistributing income while ensuring the maintenance of incentives for people to contribute to society through employment.  We are aware that limited experiments with what might be referred to as &ldquo;partial&rdquo; basic income approaches are underway or planned in other countries.  We will follow the outcome of these experiments with interest to see if they provide any lessons that might be applied to aspects of the Irish system.  </p></reply>

An Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund is currently being carried out, which will assess the financial "health" of the Fund in the coming years, and this will inform decisions on expenditure relating to the Fund.  It should be remembered that the fund does not just finance pensions, but also includes a range of payments for people of working age.</p>  <p>  The current rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing the previous bands which had been in place since 2000.  They more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person, and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. </p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded based on the average yearly contributions made during a working life.  Those with a yearly average of 48+ contributions receive a 100% pension, where, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions receive an 85% pension (not means-tested). </p>  <p>  It is estimated that reverting the contributory pension rate bands, to the percentages effective from 2000-2012, would cost over &euro;60 million next year, and this annual cost would rise at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  If such a change was introduced, it would mainly benefit pensioners with additional income above the State pension, and not those solely dependent upon it.  It would also significantly reduce the funds available for across-the-board pension increases, which were instead introduced in the 2016 and 2017 Budgets, and which benefit all pensioners, including those most at risk of poverty. </p>  <p>  Reforms and increases in the pension age have safeguarded the pension system and its core rates, despite huge demographic pressures and the economic crisis.  By achieving this, even in such difficult circumstances, the Government has shown its commitment to supporting older people, as evidenced by CSO figures which show pensioners far less likely to experience consistent poverty than the general population. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;227 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension). </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The project aims to provide all public bodies with a substantial level of assurance as to the identity of customers that present and to provide customers with a simple, easy-to-use, secure means of verifying their identity to public bodies.  In this way customers should have a consistent way of proving who they are and not have to repeat laborious identity verification processes each time they avail of a public service.</p>  <p>  The SAFE project was initially developed by an interdepartmental committee in the early-mid 2000s.  While at that juncture it was envisaged that the project would be rolled out by 2013, a range of factors impacted on this in the mid-late 2000s.</p>  <p>  Firstly, arising from the economic downturn from 2008 onwards, my Department experienced a rapid and unprecedented increase in demand for services and customer numbers.  As a result of then Government Decisions, it was also required to undertake the integration of two other organisations and introduce significant new processes.  These matters took priority over all other projects resulting in some delay to the SAFE project.</p>  <p>  Secondly, these significant new demands, customer numbers and associated staff increases required the Department to upgrade and expand its central technical infrastructure which obviously took priority over all other technical projects, including the PSC project.  This meant that the new PSC functionality could not go live until autumn 2011 at the earliest.</p>  <p>  Finally, plans for the PSC also included a free travel variant for those with that entitlement so that the insecure paper free travel pass could be replaced.  The development of this variant of the PSC was dependent on the availability of a suitable technical specification from the Railway Procurement Agency for it to work with the integrated ticketing system (ITS).  This specification did not become available until the latter part of 2013 resulting in the free travel variant of the PSC not issuing until December 2013.</p>  <p>  Given that these delays were outside the control of the project itself and its management, the project is on schedule to be completed with thin the 4-5 year period originally envisaged for its duration.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

SAFE registration, based primarily on a face-to-face engagement, is the most robust identity registration process in the State and consequently provides a substantial assurance of a person&rsquo;s identity.  Successful registration leads to a verification of a person&rsquo;s Public Services Identity (PSI) data (which includes elements such as a person&rsquo;s PPS number, name, address, date of birth, place of birth, nationality, photograph, signature, etc.).  It also results in the issue of a Public Services Card (PSC) incorporating the person&rsquo;s photograph and signature.  Accordingly, possession of a PSC gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder.   The PSC was introduced to assist people in accessing a range of Government services.  This card was designed to replace the free travel pass and the social services card of my Department and to enable other providers of public services to verify the identity of their customers.</p>  <p>  Built on top of the PSC infrastructure, a new online identity service called MyGovID provides an easy-to-use, safe and consistent way to securely access online Government services.</p>  <p>  In addition to Social Welfare schemes, SAFE registration is now a requirement for both first time adult passport applicants in the state and for citizenship applicants.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has also started making SAFE a requirement for some of its services.  Later this year SAFE will be required for Driver Theory Test applicants and adult passport renewals in the state.  In 2018 the requirement will roll out to Driving Licence Applicants and applicants for Student Universal Support Ireland.  Other public bodies are also examining how they may be able to use the SAFE infrastructure for their identity requirements.</p>  <p>  Section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the legal basis for the administration and exchange of PSI data.  Persons are required by section 262(4) to provide their PPS Number to Specified Bodies for the purpose of a transaction.  Provision is also made in the section for sharing a person&rsquo;s PSI data between Specified Bodies and such Specified Bodies are expressly authorised to use a person&rsquo;s PSI data in the performance of their public functions insofar as they relate to the person concerned.</p>  <p>  To ensure proper governance of PSI data and to ensure that public bodies comply with the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and data protection law, a Memorandum of Agreement is signed between each Specified Body and my Department regarding access to the Department&rsquo;s records and the obligations of the body with regard to such access.  In addition all organisations provided with access must nominate a Compliance Officer.  The Compliance Officer has a number of responsibilities including, the nomination of named users; ensuring that these users understand their responsibilities under the relevant legislation, agree an access protocol and sign a data protection declaration; carrying out random audits; and ensuring that only named users have access to the data.  Separately, all accesses are recorded and are subject to audit.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It replaced the former smallholders&rsquo; unemployment assistance payment.  In line with the then existing arrangements for unemployment assistance (including smallholders) and pre-retirement allowance, the income of farm assist recipients was exempt from class S PRSI for self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  Recipients of farm assist who had previously paid Class S social insurance had the option of paying voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record, provided they satisfied the qualifying conditions.  Since 1 January 2007, the exemption from class S PRSI has been removed and those receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend legislation regarding the State pension (contributory), to award a maximum rate payment to pensioners who had such a period during 1999-2006 when they were exempt from PRSI. </p>  <p>  However, a person aged over 66 with limited PRSI contributions over the course of their life may claim a State pension (non-contributory) if they have an income need, and this entitlement is not based on payment of social insurance contributions.  The maximum weekly rate is &euro;227, i.e. over 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and over 70% of such pensioners are paid at the full rate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

All social welfare payments, including pensions, continue to be paid as normal.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, social security arrangements between the UK and the EU27 also have not changed.  The future operation of arrangements will, of course, be determined as part of the complex process of negotiating the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.</p>  <p>  Clearly, a key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social security schemes, including pensions, and services between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.  The Government's long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights and social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area (CTA), are safeguarded and maintained.   </p>  <p>  To that end, I have strongly emphasised the importance of this in my meetings with  my counterparts in the UK and other EU member states</p>  <p>  In addition, as a member of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, I will take every opportunity to protect and advance this objective as will my officials.</p>  <p>  There are 10,250 customers of the Department in receipt of British Retirement Pensions (BRP) who are in receipt of State pension non-contributory (SPNC). Separately there are 152 customers, who are in receipt of BRP, and are qualified adults on their spouse&rsquo;s SPNC.  As this is a means tested pension and the level of their pensions is adjusted to take account of their BRP, the amount of their payment has been impacted as a result of currency fluctuations.  Where requested by the customer and in an effort to minimise any hardship, the Department urgently reviews the pension payable in line with current EU regulations governing currency conversion rates.  Such reviews, however, involve a full assessment of the customer&rsquo;s means. An increase in SPNC might not always be warranted when all means are updated and reassessed.  A total of 445 such requests have been made by customers in recent months.  </p></reply>

In doing this I sought to balance the improvements to social welfare payments with measures designed to make sure that the system also works for people who are in employment, including self-employed people.</p><p>On Budget Day, I announced the first general increase in all weekly rates of payment since 2009.  A &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments took effect in March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment.  Approximately 1.5 million people are benefitting from this increase.</p><p>I am also extending social insurance benefits for the self-employed.  Since last month, self-employed contributors can now avail of the Treatment Benefit scheme, which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids and contact lenses.</p><p>I also introduced changes to improve the financial benefit of work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the One Parent Family Payment and Jobseekers&rsquo; Transition payment increased by &euro;20, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing, in part, previous reductions.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents.  For example lone parents earning &euro;110 per week or more, saw their take-home income rise by up to &euro;15 per week from January 2017.</p><p>A number of Budget 2017 measures will take effect from later this year, most significantly, from December, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension.  For the first time, this will give self-employed people access to the safety net of a guaranteed income support if they have the misfortune of experiencing a debilitating illness or injury that prevents them from working.  </p><p>Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits to both employees and people who are self-employed. </p><p>In addition from the commencement of the next academic year in September, a &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to and remain in, education.</p><p>Also from September, young jobseekers under age 25 will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;193 per week when they engage in educational activity under the Back to Education Allowance scheme.  This is an increase of &euro;33 or 21% on the current level of payment. </p><p>Finally, also from September, Budget 2017 provides for the inclusion in the School Meals scheme of an additional 80 schools not currently part of DEIS but deemed to require this support following the recently launched <i>DEIS Plan 2017</i>by my colleague, the Minister of Education and Skills.  In addition for the first time in many years, School Meals will be extended to schools outside of DEIS, with the phased extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools from September 2017.</p></reply>

The one-parent family payment (OFP) and jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) schemes require the claimant to make efforts to seek maintenance in order to qualify for their payment.

Depending on the outcome and whether maintenance recommences this could involve an additional review of the payment by the Intreo Centre.  </p></reply>

Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need has transferred to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

There are currently some 20,000 active HAP tenancy arrangements in place, with 6,500 of these direct transfers from rent supplement.  As of 31 December 2016, there were approximately 16,500 active HAP tenancies, of which 5,670 were direct transfers from rent supplement.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities to facilitate the ongoing transfer of cases from rent supplement. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The RSS is a supplementary income support scheme. </p>  <p>  The following changes have been made to the RSS since 2011:</p>  <p>  - September 2012 - the eligibility conditions that applied to an increase for a qualified adult of a rural social scheme participant were revised. From that date, the rate of increase for a qualified adult is based on the family rate of the underlying qualifying payment.  Prior to that date, an increase for a qualified adult was only payable if their gross income was less than &euro;310 per week.</p>  <p>  - January 2016 - the personal rate increased from &euro;208 to &euro;210.50 and jobseekers benefit was removed from the list of qualifying payments.</p>  <p>  - February 2017 - an additional 500 places on the RSS were made available with effect from 1 February 2017.</p>  <p>  - February 2017 - entrants to the RSS must be 25 years of age and over and a 6 year overall participation limit was introduced for new entrants.  This ensures that a throughput of places is available and that younger people have an opportunity to explore other training or education options before participating on a long term-work programme.  RSS participants who commenced prior to 1 February 2017 may remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions. These new conditions only apply to new RSS participants.</p>  <p>  - March 2017 - the personal rate of payment increased from &euro;210.50 to &euro;215.50.</p>  <p>  I have seen at first-hand myself from visits to various schemes around the country over the past few months how programmes like CE and the RSS deliver both for participants and for their communities.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to these programmes is clearly demonstrated by the announcement of the additional 500 RSS places in Budget 2017, the first increase in places since 2006.  Furthermore, I recently announced changes which will widen the range of people who can take part in CE, including reducing the entry age to 21 and giving a second opportunity to people who have already taken part.  These changes will be rolled out following a consultation process with stakeholders in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This is to prevent so called &lsquo;parking&rsquo; of clients. </p><p>Providers are obliged to accept all clients referred by the Department and have no role in the selection of clients which prevents &lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo; of the employable jobseekers in preference to jobseekers that are more distant from the labour market.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual jobseeker is 52 weeks.  Participation is mandatory for those who are referred. </p><p>Fees are paid on the basis of performance.  With the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment. </p><p>The service providers are subject to regular audits and inspections.  In addition my Department will commission regular Customer Satisfaction Surveys to ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily. </p><p>The first JobPath Performance report, which includes the results of the first Customer Satisfaction Survey, was published on 17 January this year and is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash;</p><p>.</p><p>It is important to note that failure to achieve satisfactory customer ratings and/or failure to achieve employment placement targets may result in reductions of fees paid via the use of retention fees &ndash; in effect these are penalties that reduce fees paid by up to 15%.  Where Contractors do not address the issue that gives rise to use of retention fees to the satisfaction of the Department, the Department has the right to terminate the contract. </p><p>The Department will publish the next Performance Report in the coming weeks. </p><p>Regular on-site checks and inspections are carried out to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with the contract.  To date, 29 on-site inspections have been carried out at provider service delivery locations around the country, 14 to Turas Nua and 15 to Seetec locations.  </p><p>The inspections monitor compliance with the service level agreement and the contract generally, including the suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing levels, Irish language compliance, customer service and customer feedback.  Inspections may be notified or un-notified and will be conducted for the duration of the JobPath contract.  The JobPath providers are registered with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the provisions of data protection legislation.  The providers are obliged to observe the principles of data protection, which requires that personal data is used solely for the purposes for which it is collected.  Any breaches or suspected breach of the data protection legislation, in addition to being investigated by my Department, may also be referred to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that significant effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to reducing the length of time taken to finalise an appeal and that as a consequence processing times have improved quite considerably.</p>  <p>  For example, the time taken to process appeals requiring an oral hearing has reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and 24.5 weeks to date in 2017.  Processing times for appeals determined by way of summary decision have also improved from a peak of 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016 and 18.3 weeks to date in 2017.</p>  <p>  The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages which is to the benefit of the appellant.</p>  <p>  Basic supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) may be paid to a person who is awaiting the outcome of an appeal for their primary social welfare payment.  Any persons who consider they may have an entitlement under the SWA scheme should contact their local Intreo office.</p>  <p>  Continued entitlement to rent supplement is not linked to entitlement to other Department of Social Protection schemes, however the rent supplement claim may be reviewed following a decision to disallow a primary social welfare payment as there may be a change to the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances that could affect eligibility.  During a review of a rent supplement claim, the Community Welfare Services (CWS) officer will engage with the claimant to establish continued eligibility as quickly as possible and limit any delay to payments.  Any person in this situation is encouraged to contact the office responsible for their rent supplement claim to discuss their situation.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It would not be lawful or appropriate for me, as Minister, to seek to intervene in such a decision, taken by the Board.  Furthermore, the Office of the Attorney General has confirmed that Section 9 of the Citizens Information Act, 2007 does not give me such power.</p>  <p>  CIB has not taken this operational decision lightly.  It follows almost 5 years of extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The new arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  </p>  <p>  The decision reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place, which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  </p>  <p>  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  The reduced company structure will better assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, its compliance with the Code of Practise for Governance of State Bodies, and implementation of recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may already be aware, the Board of CIB is made up of people who represent people with a sense of community ethos, people with physical and mental disabilities, victims of abuse and those with advocacy needs.  It also includes representation of CIS and MABS services. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Board of CIB, mindful of the fact that all the activities of CIS and MABS are entirely funded by the Exchequer, would not take a decision that would be detrimental either to the valuable services provided locally by CIS and MABS, or to the staff and volunteers who provide them.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the Board of CIB has made what it believes to be the most appropriate decision in the best interest of the citizens of Ireland, whom it serves. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is all done with a view to helping them access a job in the open labour market.</p>  <p>  During the year, if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.  Jobseekers who are engaged on JobPath are ineligible for CE for the duration of the JobPath intervention.  However, people who have completed their year-long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE Scheme, after they have been assessed by one of my Department&rsquo;s case officers.</p>  <p>  CE schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  However, it is important to note that CE placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Once a person has been offered a place on CE by a sponsor and has a start date within 4 weeks of the date that they were referred to JobPath, they can proceed to commence on CE instead.  If there is a delay beyond 4 weeks due to awaiting Garda vetting, this 4 week period can be extended provided the Garda vetting application date precedes the JobPath referral date.</p>  <p>  In general - and JobPath and CE are no exception - job-seekers are not allowed to participate in two employment activation supports at the same time.  Given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.</p>  <p>  Any CE scheme that is experiencing difficulties in recruitment should contact their local DSP Intreo office for assistance.</p></reply>

Accordingly, there can be no question of differential treatment for particular categories of ratepayers.  The outcome for each ratepayer, whether an SME or a large company, depends on the particular circumstances of their property.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation, who has statutory responsibility for the revaluation programme and is independent in the operation of his statutory functions, that the revaluation in County Kildare has now reached the stage where Proposed Valuation Certificates have issued to each ratepayer.  Each ratepayer has a statutory right to make representations to the Commissioner within 40 days of issue of the certificates.  At this stage, the revaluation process is a work in progress and is confidential between each occupier of rateable property and the Valuation Office.  Anticipated reductions or increases in rates are not finalised at this stage.  When all representations have been considered by the Valuation Office and various adjustments made to individual valuations, as may be merited by the evidence available to the Valuation Office, each ratepayer will receive a Final Valuation Certificate in September 2017, in relation to which they will have a right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal, within 28 days.  On 15 September 2017, the Commissioner will publish the new valuation list for the Kildare County Council rating authority area containing the finalised valuations upon which rates for 2018 will be levied.  The actual amount levied in 2018 on each ratepayer will be the Net Annual Value (finalised by the Valuation Office for that particular property) multiplied by the actual Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) set by the elected members of Kildare County Council at its budgetary meeting in late 2017.</p>  <p>  Revaluation is a nationwide programme and the results from the local authorities completed to date (Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County, Fingal County, Limerick City and County, South Dublin County and Waterford City and County) have shown a general trend whereby approximately 60% of ratepayers received a reduction in rates and approximately 40% of ratepayers have received an increase.  The actual outcome can only be assessed at the end of the revaluation process when representations have been considered, any merited adjustments made and the new valuation list is published.  The actual ARV set by each Council will also have an important bearing on the outcome for ratepayers in that rating authority area.  In relation to the local authority areas currently being revalued, including Kildare County Council, this will, as indicated above, occur in late 2017.</p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that Tubbercurry Garda Station forms part of the Sligo/Leitrim Division and that the Garda strength of the Sligo/Leitrim Division on the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 301 members of whom 9 were assigned to Tubbercurry Garda Station.  There are also 21 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians attached to the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  In addition, support is provided by the Divisional Traffic Corp, Regional Support Unit, Divisional Drugs Unit and Detective Units which are regularly detailed for duty in the area concerned.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 13 of whom have been assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end, an increase of 500 from the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Sligo/Leitrim Division, in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

That station forms part of the Coolock Garda District which is within the wider D.M.R. North Garda Division.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the D.M.R. North Division on the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 685 and the strength of Coolock District was 208 of which 72 were assigned to Swords Garda station.  There are also 49 Garda Reserves and 42 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, at the request of the Policing Authority, is carrying out a review of the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities.  In this context, I understand that the Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:</p>  <p>  - the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;</p>  <p>  - the views of local communities;</p>  <p>  - the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and</p>  <p>  - relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the review should be completed within the first half of 2018 and I look forward to receiving the report from the Authority in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, some 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of some 700 in the total Garda strength since recruitment recommenced.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Code clearly defines principles to guide the decisions that those in policing make in everything they do.  The emphasis of the Code is on what good policing looks like and how police officers and staff should behave.  These principles are captured under the following headings:</p><p>- Duty to uphold the law;</p><p>- Honesty and integrity;</p><p>- Respect and equality;</p><p>- Authority and responsibility;</p><p>- Police powers;</p><p>- Information and privacy;</p><p>- Transparency and communication;</p><p>- Speaking up and reporting wrongdoing; and</p><p>- Leadership.</p><p>The Code has a statutory basis under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) and was developed by the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with a range of stakeholders and is an important milestone.  I particularly welcome the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Policing Plan 2017 to embed this Code into the day to day thinking and actions of the organisation, so that it becomes rooted in police culture, throughout the ranks and throughout the organisation.  Adherence to this Code is a declaration to the public that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acting in the public's interests, and believes in a culture that embraces integrity and the highest ethical standards.</p><p>The Authority will oversee the implementation of the Code and will review it periodically to keep it up to date with policing standards.  A copy of the Code of Ethics can be accessed on the Authority's website at <i>www.policingauthority.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The role of the Inspectorate is to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Inspectorate undertakes analysis of policies and procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and benchmarks them against the best practices and standards of comparable police services.  To date, the Inspectorate has completed 11 reports.  Their two most recent reports were the <i>Crime Investigation</i>report (2014) and the <i>&quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot;</i>report (2015).</p><p>The Garda Inspectorate has no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports.  However, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work.</p><p>However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report.  Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.</p><p>It should be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports, including the two most recent Inspectorate Reports referred to above.  Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set.</p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.  I have received the first such progress report from the Policing Authority.  Their next progress report is due by the end of April.</p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that at the Government meeting last week I received approval to begin the process of establishing a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect that the Commission will have regard to appropriate structures for oversight and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

It does however contain a number of Articles which provide Member States with a limited margin of flexibility, mainly in respect of the public sector.  Work is ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of a General Scheme of a Bill to give further effect to the GDPR and also to transpose the Data Protection Directive (Directive (EU) 670/2016) which deals with the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties.  The GDPR will come into effect on 25 May 2018 and the Directive must be transposed into Irish law by May 2018.  The Department of Justice and Equality has been in regular consultations with other Departments and public bodies and agencies in the course of preparation of the draft legislation and awareness has been raised significantly through this process.</p><p>  The GDPR encompasses a 'risk-based' approach which means that individual data controllers and data processors are required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals, is in compliance with the GDPR.  The GDPR provides for the establishment of supervisory authorities at national level with a wide range of functions and powers, including the promoting the awareness of controllers and processors of their data protection obligations.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which has already been in existence for almost 30 years, is the supervisory authority in this jurisdiction.</p><p>I am advised by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner that promoting and building awareness of the GDPR is a top priority for 2017 and beyond, using a broad range of communications channels, techniques and platforms.  These include conferences and speaking events; engagement with the media and social media; GDPR guidance; and information awareness raising campaigns.  The Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and other senior staff are engaged as speakers at a number high-level, high-impact events in 2017, focusing on GDPR awareness and circulating guidance through representative bodies.</p><p>  The Data Protection Commissioner issued an information document about the GDPR at the end of 2016 entitled &quot;The GDPR and You&quot;.  I understand that further GDPR guidance will be published over the course of 2017.</p><p>I should add that I established the Government Data Forum in 2015 which brings together a wide range of expertise and experience including legal and data protection professionals, representatives from SMEs and multinationals as well as sociologists, psychologists and education specialists.  The Forum&rsquo;s membership has been designed to enable a broad discussion of some of the key issues concerning the processing of personal data in the digital age.  Preparations for the GDPR and increasing awareness of data protection among the broader population are two key areas of focus for the Forum for the year ahead.  The centrepiece of the Forum&rsquo;s activities for this year is the Data Summit that will take place on 15 and 16 June in the Convention Centre in Dublin.  Preparations for the GDPR will be a core theme for the Summit with a series of presentations and practical &lsquo;how to&rsquo; sessions integrated throughout the programme.</p></reply>

This is one of the main statutory functions of the Commissioner of Valuation who is completely independent in the operation of his statutory functions.  The revaluation programme is the first of its kind since the mid-nineteenth century and has been a policy objective of successive governments for several decades.  The programme has gained momentum following the enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act which was initiated by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and passed into law by both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2015.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the costs incurred in the period 2005 to 2014 in respect of the revaluation programme was &euro;33 million.  The costs incurred for 2015 and 2016 (taking into account the 2015 Act) are of the order of &euro;8 million in total.  I am advised that these costs are apportioned on a pro-rata basis for the ongoing statutory and non-statutory work carried out by the Office and that these estimates are derived from the overall expenditure incurred in running the Valuation Office, taking account of staffing and other relevant costs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing costs of an organisation such as the Valuation Office would typically account for 75 - 80% of the total cost of running the organisation.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Act has enabled the Valuation Office to adopt a series of new approaches to revaluation not supported by the previous legislation, including the outsourcing of work, the use of "self assessment" principles known as 'Occupier Assisted Valuation' and more extensive use of statistical analysis.  These are being piloted during the REVAL 2017 phase of the overall programme.  Accordingly, the costs for the period from 2017 to the anticipated completion of the first revaluation programme in 2021 are likely to be significantly determined by the success or otherwise of these pilot projects and the Valuation Office is not in a position to provide an estimate of such costs until the outcome of these pilot projects is apparent.</p></reply>

It also requires that provision be made by law for securing, as far as practicable, that in all such proceedings in respect of any child who is capable of forming his or her own views, the views of the child shall be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children in family law proceedings which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.</p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as amended by section 45 of the 2015 Act, provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.</p>  <p>  The best interests of a child are to be determined in accordance with the new Part V of the 1964 Act, inserted by section 63 of the 2015 Act.  Part V, entitled &ldquo;Best Interests of the Child&rdquo;, contains two important sections.</p>  <p>  Section 31 sets out an extensive list of factors and circumstances to be taken into account by a court when determining the best interests of a child.  These include the views of the child that are ascertainable (whether in accordance with section 32 or otherwise).  The court can ascertain the views of the child in person or through an expert.  Section 31(6) provides that in obtaining the ascertainable views of a child, the court shall facilitate the free expression by the child of those views and endeavour to ensure that any views expressed by the child are not expressed as a result of undue influence, and may make an order under section 32.</p>  <p>  Section 32 facilitates the hearing of the voice of the child by enabling the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.</p>  <p>  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children and also give the courts the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is currently finalising the drafting of regulations under section 32(10) of the 1964 Act.  These regulations will specify the necessary qualifications and experience of child views experts appointed in private family law proceedings and the fees and expenses that may be charged by such experts.  The fact that regulations have not yet been made under section 32(10) does not restrict a court's power to appoint a child views expert under section 32 or otherwise to hear the voice of the child in family law proceedings.</p></reply>

In accordance with the transitional provisions of the International Protection Act, these cases are being processed under the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  All 21 appeals have been assigned to members of the Tribunal and are at various stages of processing.</p>  <p>  Regarding the numbers of persons that have been granted asylum in Ireland since 1 January, 2017, I can inform the Deputy that to date 47 individuals have been granted asylum and 27 individuals have been granted subsidiary protection in Ireland this year.</p>  <p>  The commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 at the beginning of this year represents a fundamental reform of the system for assessing the applications of those seeking international protection in Ireland.  The new system will ensure that all aspects of a person's claim (Asylum, Subsidiary protection and Humanitarian Leave to Remain) are considered together rather than sequentially as heretofore.  The new single application procedure under the International Protection Act 2015, will, in time, significantly accelerate the protection determination process and by extension will reduce the length of time which applicants spend in State provided accommodation.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling Syrian refugees from Lebanon. </p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais. Twenty-one UAMs have thus far arrived in Ireland under this initiative and are in the care of Tusla.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p>In summary, to the end of March 2017, the numbers of persons that have arrived under both the programme refugee resettlement strand and the relocated asylum seeker strands of the programme are set out in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively:</p><p>Table 1: Programme Refugees<table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>627</td><td>310</td><td>362</td><td>111</td><td>197</td><td>54</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 2: Relocated Asylum Seekers<table><tr><th>Total People</th><th>Adults</th><th>Minors</th><th>Age 0-4</th><th>Age 5-12</th><th>Age 13-17</th></tr><tr><td>380</td><td>219</td><td>161</td><td>59</td><td>76</td><td>26</td></tr></table></p><p>Further numbers will of course arrive under the relocation programme over the coming months.  Full details on the two primary strands of the programme are set out below for the information of the Deputy.</p><p>Resettlement strand of the programme</p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.</p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in 2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin. 260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016. 152 have arrived with remaining due in the coming weeks. Most of these refugees are also Syrian. A further selection mission to Lebanon is taking place to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme. </p><p>Relocation strand of the programme</p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to date taken in a total of 380 people from Greece under relocation. A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme.</p><p>Ireland has agreed to take up to 20 UAMs under the IRPP.  Fundamentally, Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the child and family agency. 6 UAMs (by the Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme. However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort.  All UAMs that have arrived to date are in the care of Tusla. </p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States. Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission and it is hoped that a resolution can be found in the coming weeks.</p><p>  The total target for relocation EU-wide in the two Council Decisions for relocation also includes an allocated portion which in the case of Ireland amounts to  910 persons. These numbers have not yet been allocated as between Greece and Italy.  It is understood that the European Commission are examining allocating this &quot;unassigned&quot; portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them. </p><p>Table 3 sets out the position regarding the assignment of the 4,000. </p><p>Table 3: Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision<table><tr><th>Relocation Strand</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>2,022</td></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation</td><td>2,622</td></tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10/11/16)</td><td>200 (up to)</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4000</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. </p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. </p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February January 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. </p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.</p><p>The Convention creates no new rights, but rather requires that people with disabilities be treated on an equal basis with others.  I should make the point that service standards and funding are subject to what the Convention describes as &lsquo;progressive realisation&rsquo; and are subject to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.  Issues around the allocation of resources are matters for each annual Budget and are for the individual Departments involved.  Insofar as the Department of Justice and Equality is concerned, there are no cost implications from ratification of the Convention.</p></reply>

It is provided on a shared care arrangement between the maternity hospital to which the patient is referred, and the Healthcare Team in the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p><p>Pregnant women attend a maternity hospital, and the babies receive the same care from Public Health Nurses as that provided to a baby born outside prison. The D&oacute;chas Centre provides a 24 hour nursing service, and has daily access to a Prison Doctor. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service has confirmed that there is a Mother and Baby Unit in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  Provision is made in the D&oacute;chas Centre to facilitate new mothers keeping their infants with them so as not to disrupt early bonding.  Each mother and child are provided with their own single room with en-suite facilities on their return to the D&oacute;chas Centre after giving birth.  Required items such as cot, baby food, nappies, etc are also provided.  As there is no mother and baby unit in Limerick Prison, any woman who needs to be accommodated in such a unit is facilitated with a transfer to the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service does not record data in the format requested in this question.  However, it can confirm the number of children born to women in custody for the years 2010 to date is included in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of babies </th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The 2016 Act provides for a new requirement for the presiding judge to ask a driver convicted in court for a driving offence to produce his/her licence to the court. The court will then record the licence details, or the fact that it was not produced, with failure to produce a licence an offence. This provision will tighten up existing procedures to enable penalty points to be matched to driving licence records following conviction in court. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that Section 33 of the Act of 2016 will be commenced on 13 April 2017. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the report referenced by the Deputy was received in November 2016.

The conduct of and decision reached in any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  Therefore, I cannot comment or intervene in any way on the conduct or decision of any individual case which is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the recent decision referred to by the Deputy in his question.  Inherent challenges will always exist in a system with a scope similar to the Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS), however the high payment rate on receipt of Fixed Charge Notices (FCNs), which I am informed stands at around 70%, must be similarly acknowledged.  At the same time, because of the reach of the FCPS, it is important to ensure that there are no loopholes that can be availed of and it is also vitally important that the operation of the FCPS has the confidence of the judiciary that interact with the system.</p>  <p>  While the majority of FCNs are paid, consideration has been given to those who, for whatever reason, do not pay within the 56-day period, but do not wish to have their case proceed to Court.  Arrangements for the commencement of Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which provides for the Third Payment Option, are underway in both my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This section, once commenced, will provide a person who is served with a summons in respect of a fixed charge offence, the opportunity to pay a fixed charge, not later than 7 days before the date of the Court on which the charge is to be heard, and a FCN is included with the summons to this effect.  If a person takes up the third payment option, proceedings in respect of the alleged offence will be discontinued and the person need not attend court.  It is envisaged that this Third Payment Option will be implemented by the third quarter of 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department jointly chairs the multi-agency Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Working Group is charged with overseeing and facilitating the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate's report on &lsquo;The Fixed Charge Processing System &ndash; A 21st Century Strategy&rsquo; (February 2014).  Some 22 of the 37 recommendations have been fully implemented to date, with 5 additional recommendations on track for delivery by Summer 2017.  Work on the remaining recommendations is ongoing and the majority of these recommendations are medium-long-term in nature.  The Working Group is scheduled to meet again later this month and I can assure the Deputy that the matters raised in relation to the issuing of FCNs will receive attention at this forthcoming meeting.</p></reply>

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.  The following table below provides the number of legal aid certificates issued by District Court area.  Figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown of the number of applications for free legal aid granted in the Circuit Court.  Total expenditure on criminal legal aid for each of the past three years is as follows - 2014 - &euro;49.890 million; 2015 - &euro;50.879 million; 2016 - &euro;52.998 million.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.274.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100064#WRF01800"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the HTB incentive was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'. This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current housing crisis, of which the HTB incentive is just one. The comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector. While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy (HTB) scheme should be considered. Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan. The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases. Therefore, the impact of the HTB incentive on property prices should not be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply. In my view, it is the lack of supply that is primarily responsible for driving house prices higher and I would point out that increases in house prices prevailed long before the introduction of the Help to Buy incentive. I would also point out that the HTB is targeted towards new build homes only, and to first-time buyers only, and it would be simplistic to designate this incentive as being the sole or the major contributor to house price increases. Furthermore, the incentive is designed to help first-time buyers obtain the deposit required to facilitate the purchase of a home. Therefore it helps first-time buyers to meet the loan to value requirements of the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules. However, the loan to income requirements of those rules must also be satisfied and the HTB pays no role in relation to that aspect.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including movements in property prices. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the incentive which will look at, among other issues, its potential impact on property prices. The contract for this assessment, following the completion of a competitive tendering process, will be awarded shortly.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that in Budget 2017, I halved the rate of USC applying on the first &euro;12,012 of income from 1% to 0.5%, and reduced the rate of USC on the next &euro;6,760 of income from 3% to 2.5%.  Therefore Budget 2017 has further reduced the USC step to just under &euro;85 annually, or &euro;1.63 per week.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that exempting the first &euro;13,000 of income for USC for all taxpayers would have significant cost implications. It is estimated that the full-year cost of exempting the first &euro;13,000 of income from USC for all taxpayers, with USC applying at current rates on amounts above &euro;13,000, would be approximately &euro;175 million.</p>  <p>  The current Government has committed to continuing the process of phasing out the USC in future Budgets.  It is intended that this will occur as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners and limits the benefits for high earners.  In this regard the Income Tax Reform Plan developed for consultation with the Oireachtas and published by my Department in July last year, may be of interest, and is available at the following link: www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/Income%20Tax%20Reform%20Plan-FINAL_0.pdf.</p></reply>

As I have pointed out before, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives periodically in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and, if necessary, re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them. The OPFTC was reviewed by the 2009 Commission on Taxation, which acknowledged that the credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However in its recommendations the Commission concluded that the credit should be allocated to the primary carer only. The restructuring of the OPFTC into the SPCCC achieved such an outcome. I would also point out that there is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code, therefore married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the OPFTC cost to the Exchequer in 2013, its final year, was &euro;141.6 million in respect of 104,100 claimants. The SPCCC cost to the Exchequer in 2014, the latest year for which data are available, was &euro;94 million in respect of 71,100 claimants.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that it is possible for a qualifying Primary Claimant to surrender his or her entitlement to the credit in favour of a Secondary Claimant where the child resides with that Secondary Claimant for at least 100 days per year. It should be noted that a Secondary Claimant does not qualify for the SPCCC in his/her own right. Rather it is the primary carer of the child who is entitled to the credit subject to meeting the qualifying criteria and, should he/she choose, may subsequently surrender the credit to a Secondary Claimant who has care of the child for at least 100 days in a year. </p>  <p>  Where the child's primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the SPCCC, on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person, and therefore no credit is available to be relinquished to a Secondary Claimant.  However should the Secondary Claimant become the primary carer of the child in the future, he/she may be entitled to apply for the SPCCC in his/her own right. I am satisfied that the SPCCC in its current form is targeting limited resources to where they are most needed.</p></reply>

These regulations transpose the EU Directive "Solvency II"  into Irish legislation. Secondly, the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the supervision of conduct of business in Ireland, also referred to as consumer protection.  All insurance undertakings operating in Ireland, whether authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland or a competent authority of another EU state, are subject to conduct of business supervision by the Central Bank of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland operates an assertive risk based approach to supervision which is supported by a credible threat of enforcement. Its enforcement strategy is aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour in regulated entities and those that work in such entities.  The relevant enforcement tools including penalties for non-compliance are set out on the Central Bank of Ireland's website: www.centralbank.ie/regulation/how-we-regulate/enforcement.</p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to your last point, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is therefore a commercial matter for insurance companies.</p></reply>

When bond yields fall, the market value of debt issued at higher rates goes up. This means it would cost the NTMA more to buy that debt from the investors who hold it than the NTMA originally borrowed. Put simply, a holder of a bond that is paying an annual coupon of 5% will not exchange that bond for a lower coupon without charging a significant premium.</p>  <p>  To buy back the bonds that are due to mature in 2019 and 2020 would require the NTMA to issue approximately 15 per cent more par debt. This would add to the existing stock of public debt, which is already elevated.</p>  <p>  However, the NTMA has taken advantage of the opportunities presented by lower borrowing costs by actively lengthening the maturity of Ireland's debt and by pre-funding in advance of major redemptions.  Today, Ireland has one of the longest average maturities in Europe.</p>  <p>  The NTMA has also built up a significant amount of cash as it has pre-funded ahead of its future obligations.  Cash balances were over &euro;15 billion at end-March.</p>  <p>  Along with the actions mentioned above the NTMA has accelerated the buyback of the Floating Rate Notes to lock in today's market rates which is effectively the NTMA taking out insurance against rates rising into the future.  In addition, it has executed bilateral switches redeeming early short-term bonds in exchange for longer-term bonds and reduced the bond refinancing requirement by over &euro;2.5 billion.</p>  <p>  The net impact of all NTMA actions, including the early repayment of loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has been to reduce the size of the refinancing obligation out to end-2020 from &euro;70 billion to close to &euro;40 billion, when account is taken of Exchequer cash balances.</p></reply>

The CcyB is a time varying capital requirement and is designed to make the banking system more resilient and less pro-cyclical; essentially the CCyB will increase the capital requirement of banks when credit growth is "excessive".</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's framework for macro prudential policy elaborates the aims of such policies, which are to: </p>  <p>  -  strengthen the resilience of the financial system so that it can withstand adverse movements in credit and property cycles or the impact of other economic shocks; </p>  <p>  -  reduce the potential for vulnerabilities that could lead to the accumulation of financial distress. (Many of the vulnerabilities arise through the pro-cyclicality of the credit cycle). </p>  <p>  Both of these aims are key priorities of the Central Bank in its dual mission to 'safeguard stability and protect consumers'. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank keeps credit conditions in the Irish economy and it macro prudential policy instruments under review, and calibrates them as considered appropriate.  The Central Bank reviews its mortgage lending measures on an annual basis (details are available at www.centralbank.ie/financial-system/financial-stability/macro-prudential-policy/mortgage-measures and the most recent changes to the lending rules came into effect from the start of this year) and it calibrates its CCyB on a quarterly basis (its quarterly assessments are available at www.centralbank.ie/financial-system/financial-stability/macro-prudential-policy/countercyclical-capital-buffer).</p>  <p>  These measures are also complementary to existing micro prudential supervision, and to lenders' own risk management practices. The introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014 brought about a fundamental change to the supervision of banking in Ireland and in other participating Member States.  The SSM approach to supervision is risk-based. It takes into account both the degree of damage which the failure of an institution could cause to financial stability and the likelihood of such a failure occurring. Where the SSM judges that there are increased risks to a credit institution or group of credit institutions, those credit institutions will be supervised more intensively until the relevant risks decrease to an adequate level. The SSM approach to supervision is based on qualitative and quantitative approaches, and involves judgment and forward-looking critical assessment. In this context it can be noted that credit risk is a key priority for the SSM in 2017. </p></reply>

Costs relating to the purchase and disposal of an asset are allowed in calculating the amount of CGT due. In addition, indexation relief is available up to and including the year 2002. This relief ensures that gains that relate to inflation up to the end of 2002 are not charged to CGT. </p>  <p>  CGT is chargeable in the situation outlined where individuals sell a portion of their farm to build a family home for themselves.  The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in a tax year is exempt from CGT. The rate of CGT is currently 33%. </p>  <p>  There is insufficient information provided in order to give a view as to whether a relief may be available. However, depending on the circumstances of the individuals concerned, a relief known as CGT retirement relief may apply to them. This relief applies where individuals owned and used land for farming purposes for a minimum period of 10 years up to the time that the land is sold.  In certain situations, land which was let can qualify for relief provided that, immediately before the land was first let, it was owned and used for farming purposes by the individuals selling the land. Where the individual disposing of the land is aged between 55 and 65 and the disposal is to a person other than his or her child, full relief from CGT applies where the market value of the land does not exceed &euro;750,000.  In the case of individuals aged 66 or over, the threshold is reduced to &euro;500,000. Marginal relief may apply where the market value of the land does not greatly exceed either &euro;500,000 or &euro;750,000, as the case may be. </p>  <p>  Where the individual is aged between 55 and 65 and the disposal is to a child of that individual, full relief from CGT applies.

However, data published by the CSO show that manufacturing output prices increased by 2.4 per cent in February year-on-year, compared with a decrease of -0.7 per cent in 2016 as a whole.  This suggests that manufacturing firms were able to offset some of their cost pressures by raising output prices.  These price rises are lower than those for the euro area, where industrial producer prices increased by 4.5 per cent year-on-year in February.  This producer price inflation reflects, inter alia, the impact of rising oil prices globally. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless,  price inflation can put pressure on the competitiveness of these firms which is not desirable over the long term.  In this regard, it is important that, at firm level, overall costs do not get out of line with our competitors and that pay moves in line with productivity developments.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that my Department continues to monitor Ireland's price and competitiveness developments closely and will continue to maintain competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Fund service providers are allowed to outsource certain activities, but the fund service provider ultimately remains responsible for those outsourced activities.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that when reviewing a Fund Service Provider's control environment, assessment of the governance and oversight of outsourcing arrangements is a key area of supervisory focus. The Bank robustly assesses and challenges governance and oversight of outsourcing arrangements. This is achieved by the Bank through regular engagement at individual firm level, industry thematic reviews on outsourcing and off-shore inspections of outsourcing services providers. </p>  <p>  In a recent thematic review of outsourcing, the Bank found that outsourcing in larger fund service providers is extensive and observed good governance arrangements where risks were being managed adequately. The review also found some weaknesses and a letter has been sent to all Irish regulated Fund Administrators outlining examples of good practise and making a number of recommendations.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the letter, I have been informed by the Bank that it intends to issue guidance to supplement the Investment Firm Regulations (Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48(1)) (Investment Firms) Regulations 2017). The regulations and upcoming guidance will include provisions to further enhance fund service provider's oversight of outsourced activities. This will ensure that the Central Bank can subject fund service providers to a strong regulatory framework, and that the good practises found by the Bank in its recent review are more widely followed.  </p></reply>

The income is then taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution) as the investor will pay tax as appropriate in the investor's country of residence or establishment.  Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle or Fund.  </p>  <p>  The essence of the regime is that there is no tax on the income and gains accruing to the fund but that an exit charge is imposed on chargeable events, i.e. payments to certain unitholders as distributions of income/capital gains and on gains realised by them on disposal of their units.  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.  Where the investor is not resident/ordinarily resident in Ireland no exit tax should be deducted provided appropriate declarations are in place.</p>  <p>  Irish resident investors subject to the exit tax are also subject to an 8 year deemed disposal rule.  If an Irish resident investor has invested in a fund, then every 8 years exit tax arises in respect of that investor.  This prevents open ended funds rolling-up their profits indefinitely and ensures that the tax deferral cannot be indefinite.  </p>  <p>  I want to state that Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  We only want real and substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment.  Ireland has not been and will never be a brass plate location. </p>  <p>  The OECD has made a series of recommendations, as part of the BEPS process, which are designed to give tax authorities the tools necessary to ensure that profits are correctly attributed to the country where the economic activity which generates them takes place.  The BEPS recommendations will greatly enhance the ability of participating countries to ensure the correct alignment of tax and substance and Ireland is playing its part in the implementation of these recommendations.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS project and I believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning. Ireland will now play an active part in the work to implement the BEPS recommendations globally.  The post-BEPS environment will see companies seek to better align the amount of tax that they pay with their substantive operations.  The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has long been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy.</p></reply>

The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.  The 'Gross Roll Up' regime is the term applied to the mechanism whereby investment funds are not subjected to taxation on their income and gains within the fund.  That allows the income of the fund to 'roll up' on a gross basis within the fund.  The fund may thus grow without deductions for taxation.  The fund may, however, suffer withholding taxes on its income or gains and is investors will pay tax as appropriate in the investor's country of residence or establishment.  I believe that this is a more appropriate model for taxing funds rather than through a levy.</p>  <p>  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation at fund level is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation, that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution.  Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle or Fund. </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the leading jurisdictions in the world for the establishment and servicing of internationally distributed investment funds.  The international funds industry employs over 13,000 people in Ireland.  It is a major element of the International Financial Services (IFS) industry which employs over 38,000 people in the State. </p>  <p>  In the Finance Act 2016 I introduced the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime to address the issue of non resident investors, who had been investing in Irish property through fund structures.  An IREF is an investment undertaking in which 25% or more of the value of the assets is derived from IREF assets or where it is reasonable to consider the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the investment undertaking is to acquire IREF assets or to carry on IREF business.  The IREF must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions. </p></reply>

By deciding to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the ASTI has placed its members outside that Agreement and has decided that the Agreement&rsquo;s benefits and protections will not apply to its members.  The protection from compulsory redundancy that public servants have arises from commitments given by the Government under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  Another benefit of the Agreement is the continuation of the Ward Report measures in relation to contracts of indefinite duration and a revised sequence for filling posts &ndash; both of which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the redeployment scheme for school surpluses is to deal with situations where teacher surpluses arise without the need for compulsory redundancies.  The process of identifying staff surpluses takes place in the first half of each year and takes effect from the start of the following school year. The process operates and deals with any surplus for the following school year.  </p>  <p>  The process for the 2017/18 school year is currently under way in the Department. 60 secondary schools were identified as possible surplus schools for the 2017/18 school year.  These 60 schools received a letter notifying them of their surplus and were given an opportunity to respond to same. This represents the total number of schools where potential surpluses could arise. </p>  <p>  However, at this stage of the process it is too early to say what the final position as regards the level of surplus will be, either generally or in particular schools.  The level of surplus is influenced by many factors including retirements, career breaks, job-sharing etc. and additional allocations for the forthcoming year in respect of demographics.  This continues to evolve as new information is received from relevant schools.  Given that Budgets 2016 and 2017 did not negatively impact on teacher allocations, it would not be surprising that the level of redeployment would be lower than in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The Department expects to know the final position in relation to the number of surplus teachers shortly. This is no different to what has transacted in previous years.</p></reply>

The application was considered in the context of the very significant challenges facing my Department in prioritising available capital funding for essential mainstream classrooms to meet the demand for extra school places and in cases where additional teachers have been appointed.  The school has not been sanctioned an additional teaching post and on that basis, my Department was not in a position to provide grant to the school.  My Department wrote to the school last December explaining the position.  </p>  <p>  With regard to prefab replacement, over the lifetime of my Department's Capital Programme, it is my intention to replace all purchased temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation, where the need is established.  To enable this development, my Department will be carrying out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in all schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers, to deliver the curriculum.  This will also determine whether or not individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school.  When completed, this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced.</p></reply>

Provision under the scheme is made for those pupils whose degree of disability is such that without such technological support it would not be possible for them to access the school curriculum.  </p>  <p>  The criteria which must be evidenced to qualify for support under the scheme are that the professional reports state that the equipment is essential for the effective education of the child, illustrating how the recommended equipment is to be used for educational purposes throughout the school day and that the needs outlined in the professional report cannot be met from within the school&rsquo;s existing school I.T. equipment. </p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at pupils with specific educational needs and provides equipment of a direct educational benefit which has been recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) as being essential for those pupils to access the school curriculum.  </p>  <p>  An application for assistive technology support for the child in question was initially refused by my Department on the basis that the device is recommended for communication purposes; the professional report submitted sets out that the equipment will provide an augmentative means of communication for the child in question.  Funding is provided by my Department, under the Assistive Technology scheme, for equipment for educational purposes, whereas communication devices are provided for by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through its Aids and Appliances scheme.  The equipment recommended is to enable the child in question to communicate not only in school, but in the broader social context.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware officials at my Department meet cross sectorally with officials from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the NCSE, on a regular basis, in order to consider issues in relation to the provision of educational services for children with special educational needs.  The purpose of such cross sectoral meetings is to enhance co-ordination and cooperation between the health and education sectors in planning for the education of children and related matters across a range of service areas.  This matter will, therefore, be raised with the interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team.</p></reply>

Since then, at the request of the Teaching Council, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills has operated probationary inspections arrangements for newly qualified teachers.  This was agreed in order to allow the Teaching Council time to develop, trial and put in place more appropriate induction/probation arrangements to enable teachers gain full registration with the Council.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Teaching Council has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme promotes ongoing, sustained professional development through an initial period of in-school induction and mentoring and gives effect to one of the Teaching Council&rsquo;s primary functions &ndash; that of peer regulation and setting the standards of entry into the profession and registration as a teacher. </p>  <p>  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016.  The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.  Inherent to this policy is a structure to support the growth and development of Droichead over a number of years, whereby the availability of the traditional Inspectorate route to gaining full registration with the Council (known as probation) will be phased-out in favour of the new Droichead path for the early professional development of teachers and their induction into the profession.  The growth and development phase of the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Droichead policy has identified teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting to be the first cohort of teachers for whom Droichead would be the only route available to achieve full registration with the Council during the 2016-17 school year.

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new DEIS Identification Model used to assess the level of disadvantage among the pupil cohort of a school has been applied fairly using centrally held data adopting an objective and scientific approach which has been uniformly applied for all schools in the country. </p>  <p>  Full details of the process involved in the assessment of schools is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/.</p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model including details of how the datasets are used to determine a schools level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date information to my Department's online pupil databases.   </p>  <p>  In terms of the process to date, as I have already pointed out, the position in relation to the new model is that, in its initial application, it has identified that there are schools not previously included in DEIS, whose level of concentrated disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, I am moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this is a first step in a process and the fact that a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date should the assessment indicate a level of disadvantage that warrants additional supports.  As I have also previously stated, I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.  The completion of this work will inform ongoing provision and consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p></reply>

The Working Group will be required to present a full report to the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s (HEA) Finance Committee in the third quarter of 2017.  It will be engaging with the Local Enterprise Office, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, as well as the Implementation Committee of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs West which is charged with overseeing the delivery of 25,000 jobs across Mayo, Roscommon and Galway over the lifetime of the Plan.  GMIT is also represented on the Atlantic Economic Corridor Steering Group, which is a key part of the Action Plan on Rural Development. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA recognise the particular challenges attached to multi-campus provision in both GMIT and other institutes of technology.  A major review of the funding allocation model of higher education has commenced and the review will look at how the future model can take account of the additional costs associated with these arrangements.  My Department and the HEA are committed to such multi-campus provision, including Castlebar. </p>  <p>  The HEA and GMIT Governing Body have re-confirmed to my Department their commitment to implementing a viable development plan for the Castlebar campus as part of this process and GMIT has appointed an Interim Head of the campus in Castlebar to lead this process.  </p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me, particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so &ndash; an issue which is clearly set out in the Report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding for Higher Education, which is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration. However, in seeking to address the issue in the short term, I have for the first time in nine years secured additional funding for the sector with &euro;36.5m additional being made available this year and &euro;160m additional overall over the next three years. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  It is estimated that the mechanism, which proposes an increase in the national training fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional &euro;200 million revenue in 2020.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Department by 5 p.m. on Thursday, 13 April.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments.  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors.</p></reply>

The recent Budget contained measures to deliver on this. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the Public Service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. </p>  <p>  The new Junior Cycle has been developed over several years and is now in the process of being implemented.  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health.  Third year students will sit the new Junior Cycle English examination in June of this year, which is the first new subject specification to be introduced under the Framework for Junior Cycle. </p>  <p>  I welcomed the guidance from the State Exams Commission which was issued to schools earlier this month.  It provided an important reassurance for Junior Cycle students and their parents that all students sitting their final examinations this year will have access to the full 100% of marks available for their English examination.  An ASTI statement provided further reassurance in this regard. Schools have been notified of a second calendar window in the 2016/17 school year to allow for the completion and submission of the Junior Cycle English Assessment Task by students who were prevented from meeting the initial deadline.  This Assessment Task is externally assessed (which was always the case) and forms part of the final examination marked by the State Examinations Commission (SEC). </p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours are part of wider productivity measures introduced under the Public Service Agreements that require all public servants to work additional time for no additional payment. </p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours represent a real reform with significant benefits for parents and children.  In schools, the Croke Park hours are 33 additional hours a year at post primary (36 hours at primary) worked by teachers.  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.</p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.  Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.</p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.</p></reply>

The report noted, however, that this is an indicative estimate and that it is unrealistic to assume that the report can predict exactly the quantum of future student demand of SNAs.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing an additional 100 SNA posts would be in the region of &euro;3.38 million based on current costs.</p>  <p>  In total, the number of SNAs available for allocation to schools to June 2017 is 13,015 posts, which represents an increase of almost 23% or 2440 posts since 2011/12, when 10,575 posts were available.  Last year alone I secured an increase of almost 1000 SNAs.  </p>  <p>  The extent of funding required to provide for SNA support in future years will therefore take into account the actual demand which transpires annually, while also taking into account the significant increases in SNA numbers already provided.</p>  <p>  The FPA report recommended that the NCSE provide an End of Year Statement of Demand and a forecast of future demand in mid-April each year, with an updated forecast by mid-June to take account of trends arising during the current year&rsquo;s application process. </p>  <p>  The SNA demand for 2017/18 school year will be known when this process has been completed.</p></reply>

Delivery on this commitment is underway in 2017 with an additional ten NEPS psychologists due to be recruited by the commencement of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  In answer to the Deputy's particular question, the direct cost of providing 100 additional NEPS psychologists would be approximately &euro;7.3m per annum.   </p></reply>

The complex needs component of the profile will form one part of the profiled allocation with the extent of allocations being made to any component of the model being relative to each other and the number of qualifying pupils in each category. </p>  <p>  There are currently approximately 7000 posts allocated to schools in the Low Incidence/Complex needs component of the school profile, at a current cost of approximately &euro;420M. </p>  <p>  Assuming no other changes were made to this base allocation level, or cost, the estimated cost of increasing the low incidence/complex needs proportion of the special needs allocation to schools under the new resource allocation model by 5%, would be &euro;21M per year, by 10% would be &euro;42M per year, by 15% would be &euro;63M per year, and by 20% would be &euro;84M per year.</p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. </p></reply>

In schools, the Croke Park hours are 33 additional hours a year at post primary (36 hours at primary) worked by teachers.  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.</p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer. Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.</p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.</p></reply>

These arrangements are mainly focused at post-primary level. It is fair to say that before the moratorium, due to the way the allowances were structured, notwithstanding the fact that one out of every two teachers held a management allowance the workload issue and the pressures on Principals and Deputy Principals existed.  The estimated cost of lifting the moratorium on posts of responsibility and restoring them to pre-moratorium levels would be in the order of &euro;50m. </p>  <p>  School leaders have a key role to play in determining the shape of our schools and student outcomes. Leading on curricular change and change management are key challenges for every school leader.  The challenge for schools and the Department is therefore to build a leadership partnership that is fit for 21st century Ireland and school context.</p>  <p>  We have reviewed the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be freed up from teaching time and be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  This has been structured in a different way to what existed before the moratorium.  At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school and effective from the start of the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school.  With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts to lift the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts in both the primary and post-primary sector.  A Department circular is due to issue shortly in relation to these new arrangements.</p>  <p>  Strengthening leadership in schools is a major priority of mine and these announcements are initial steps to support and enhance leadership and management in our schools.</p></reply>

Improvements to the staffing of these schools were announced for the 2015/16 school year.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical policy area.</p>  <p>  The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a schools&rsquo; level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a &lsquo;multiplier effect&rsquo;, whereby students attending a school with a concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background.  Research in the area of educational disadvantage indicates a strong evidence base in the Irish context that the social class mix of a school matters, providing a rationale for prioritising supports for schools which cater for high concentrations of pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds. </p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, I am moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.  It is important to note therefore that this is a first step in a process and the fact a school has not been included now does not preclude its inclusion at a later date.  </p>  <p>  Further work will be required to refine the application of the new model in terms of resource allocation.  The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out details of the work that will be carried out to ultimately reach a point where the new identification model and the process of resource allocation will ensure that resources in schools are appropriately matched to the identified need within the school.</p></reply>

In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.</p>  <p>  In relation to the development of a curriculum for Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics in primary schools, as recommended by the Forum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment recently published a consultation report which outlines the key messages arising from the consultation process that they conducted in 2015/16 and the implications for the development of a curriculum.  The Consultation Report describes a way forward for the development of integrated provision for ERB and Ethics as part of the newly-developing primary curriculum. </p>  <p>  As a step in advancing the recommendations of the Forum on Patronage in this regard, the NCCA has formed a network of schools to gather and share examples of good practice in the area of ERB and Ethics for schools to use in supporting and developing their practice in this area.

There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.  In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.  The reconfiguration process for primary school patronage will be open to application from all patrons offering multi-denominational or non-denominational school models.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.  My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.  I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.</p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons.  I believe that the reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system. </p></reply>

In its concluding observations the Committee welcomed measures taken to improve women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; access to quality education in Ireland and particularly welcomed the new short course in Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).  In relation to the recommendation on education on sexual and reproductive health and rights, referred to by the Deputy, Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE) is included as part of SPHE, which is a mandatory programme at primary level.  At primary level, SPHE provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him/her to create and maintain supportive relationships and become an active and responsible citizen in society.  Through an SPHE programme that is planned and consistent throughout the school, children can develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their decisions and actions both now and in the future.  As children progress through an SPHE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues, including relationships, sexuality and child abuse prevention.  The SPHE curriculum is structured in such a way that these issues are not explored in isolation; rather the emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all issues, with specific information provided where necessary.</p>  <p>  SPHE is also a mandatory programme at post-primary junior cycle level.

Special Classes and Special Schools are staffed with a lower pupil&ndash;teacher ratio ranging from 6-1 to 12-1, on the basis of disability categorisation of pupils attending the school.</p><p>There are currently 1,152 special classes nationally, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 126 are ASD early intervention classes, 526 are primary ASD classes and 236 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes. 125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it, from infants to eighteen years of age.</p><p>With regard to Co. Dublin (city and county), the NCSE has advised that there 119 ASD special classes attached to mainstream primary schools.</p><p>The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas. </p><p>In this regard the NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools in opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision and in order to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand.</p><p>Parents/guardians may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on <i><font color="#2F2F2F">www.ncse.ie.</font></i></p><p>As details relating specifically to the area referred to by the Deputy are not readily available in my Department, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources including my Department&rsquo;s own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  My Department is not in receipt of applications for additional accommodation from any of the 8 primary schools in the Skerries school planning area.</p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for the Skerries school planning area is being kept under review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases in this area. </p>  <p>  The outcome of this review of demographic changes and school capacity in the school planning area will determine the means by which any additional school places which may be required will be met. </p></reply>

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2013 and 2015 as set out in Section 3 of the Circular applies to all other teachers employed in such schools.</p>  <p>  As is the norm with public service collective agreements, the Lansdowne Road Agreement was negotiated with trade unions which are recognised as representing staff in the public service (including teachers).  It is normal practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade/sector.  This context does not allow for acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there is no proposal at this time to treat teachers separately based on the fact that they are not a member of a trade union.  However, since the announcement of the ASTI ballot result my Department has received a number of queries from both ASTI members and teachers who are not members of a trade union about union membership.  Therefore, having regard to the circumstances of the dispute with the ASTI, this is an issue that I will keep under review going forward.</p></reply>

The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally.  The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for higher income thresholds for larger families.  In addition to this, further increases in the income thresholds are provided for where additional family members are attending further and/or higher education at the same time.</p>  <p>  The current system of student supports is underpinned by the Student Support Act, 2011.

A key priority of the Strategy will be to address the broadband connectivity issues experienced by primary schools owing to infrastructural deficits and the dispersal of primary schools.  My Department is collaborating with the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment on this issue, having regard to the National Digital Strategy.</p><p>Through the current Schools Broadband Access Programme, the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary, post-primary and special schools.  The overall policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with technical solutions available in the market and within required financial parameters. </p><p>The Department has upgraded more than 1,000 school connections to fibre broadband in fibre broadband enabled areas.  Under the current programme, the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, within the parameters of the programme and in compliance with procurement and contractual obligations.  Connecting schools to fibre broadband where and when available are considered in that context.</p><p>Currently, 3G/4G services are not available on the DES Schools Broadband Network due to the fact that Service Providers cannot guarantee bandwidth and contention across their networks as outlined in the Department specification of service requirements, and generally their service comes with a restrictive download limit.  Connections supplied through the Schools Broadband Network have no download limit.</p><p>The Strategy recognises the issues schools face in relation to ICT infrastructure, and funding of &euro;210m is committed to address these requirements over the period of the Strategy.  The first tranche of funding of &euro;30m in respect of the 2016-2017 school year has been issued to all eligible primary and post-primary schools.

Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.

To ensure effective targeting of limited resources, local authority loan finance continues to be available to first-time buyers only for the purpose of purchasing or building a home.</p>  <p>  My Department does, however, fund a range of housing supports for persons with a disability, living in both privately-owned housing and local authority housing.  The Disabled Person Grant Scheme provides funds to local authorities to undertake adaptations and extensions to homes to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability, or to address serious overcrowding.  The Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme for Older People and People with a Disability is also delivered by local authorities with funding from my Department.  It assists other people and people with a disability in private houses to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.684.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100073#WRP00700"><p>The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (July 2016), which is available at the following link,<i></i>, is focused on increasing supply, across all tenures, to achieve total housing output of at least 25,000 homes per year by 2021 and beyond, effectively doubling the output of 12,600 homes recorded in 2015.</p><p>While still at an early stage of implementation, there is already strong evidence that the focus on increasing and accelerating housing supply in Rebuilding Ireland is starting to work.  The latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to strengthen.  Completions for the 12-month period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the twelve month period to end January 2017, up 44% year on year.  </p><p>Importantly, at the end of 2016, there were 144 active sites in the Dublin region, which will deliver approximately 5,500 new homes.  My expectation is that some 18,000 homes will be completed nationally this year.</p><p>While increasing supply, we also want to increase choice for all segments of the housing system including, inter alia, first-time buyers, renters, students, older people and indeed expanding families wishing to trade up.  The various housing segments are of course interlinked and interactive. </p><p>An important feature of the new supply is the development of key State-owned sites in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  The Dublin local authorities are all well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing with projects advancing that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed tenure homes in Dublin.  The final model for each site is the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. </p><p>In bringing proposals forward, local authorities are cognisant of the need to provide housing across the spectrum.  In this regard, in providing more choice for older people, perhaps living alone, to trade down to a more manageable sized home, this should provide more opportunities for those families seeking to trade up to larger homes.  My Department is actively engaging with local authorities bringing forward such proposals.</p><p>Identification and development of key sites in the major urban areas where demand is greatest and the recent announcement of &euro;226 million of enabling infrastructure investment to facilitate construction of some 23,000 homes by 2021 are further initiatives that will significantly boost supply.</p><p>In addition, to reduce the risk and impact of future housing cycles, under Pillar 4 of Rebuilding Ireland I published the Strategy for the Rental Sector (December 2016) to promote a well-developed rental market as a genuine alternative to ownership.  While many households may continue to strive to buy rather than rent, I want to ensure that a real option to rent exists.  A more developed rental market will also help moderate the property cycle and reduce household exposure to house price fluctuations.</p><p>The Government has also taken a number of steps to assist homeowners who wish to 'up-size' from the starter home they purchased but find themselves in negative equity. In appropriate cases, the Central Bank is allowing banks to provide new mortgages to people to move home, even if the homeowner is currently experiencing negative equity.  In addition, housing loans for borrowers in negative equity, who wish to obtain a mortgage for a new property, are not included within the scope of the LTV limits. </p><p>Through the range of actions currently being progressed through Rebuilding Ireland to increase the supply of homes across all tenures, the Government has created the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market, capable of providing homes, at affordable price points to buy or rent, where and when they are needed for all segments of the housing system. </p></reply>

This legislation requires all housing authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households in receipt of such support that have been approved for a transfer to another dwelling provided by a local authority or approved housing body.</p></reply>

The Irish Water Business Plan is based on the domestic charging regime as provided for in the Water Services Act 2014.  The Plan was considered by Government in October 2015, and was approved subject to normal regulatory and budgetary review.

Development contributions can only be levied as capital funding for public infrastructure and facilities and as such, cannot be used to pay current costs.  Income from development contributions must be ring-fenced to pay for facilities servicing new development, for example, for roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces and it is a matter for each local authority to determine the allocation of those incomes, having regard to the provisions of sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that local authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and therefore recognise income and expenditure as incurred relating to the period, regardless of the cash transactions.  The Annual Financial Statements (AFSs), therefore, do not show cash movements or cash on hand in relation to development contributions but show the invoiced income and the amount of development contributions due to local authorities.  Information on the monetary value of development contributions collected and unspent by local authorities at year end is not available in my Department.  My Department is currently reviewing management information being collected from the local government sector, including in respect of development contributions, and may make some changes to requirements in the coming year, following consultation with local authority Directors of Finance. </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for monitoring the local government sector&rsquo;s compliance with fiscal rules set out as part of the management of the Stability and Growth Pact.  These include the contribution of the local government sector to the General Government Balance (GGB) and also controls to be exercised under the Expenditure Benchmark requirements.  Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the General Government Deficit limit, local authorities have been directed that, similar to the revenue account activity, capital expenditure should not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves.  However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for the expenditure of built-up capital balances and own resources funded by development contributions on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department.  In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently. </p></reply>

The Government decided that 80% of the estimated LPT liability in each local authority area for a given year is retained in that area to fund public services, notwithstanding any local variation decisions.  The remaining 20% of LPT is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to those local authorities that have lower property tax bases, due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  This reflects the fact that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources.</p>  <p>  In accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of LPT funding, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it known as the LPT baseline.  There are variances across the country in terms of LPT levels but it is important that all local authorities in the State receive at least this minimum funding level to ensure they can deliver services.  The LPT funding baseline in 2017 is linked to previous General Purpose Grant amounts and Pension Related Deductions retained by authorities in 2014. </p>  <p>  The needs of local authorities vary significantly across the State, depending on a complex range of factors.  My Department keeps the allocation mechanism under review to ensure equitable treatment of all local authorities.  Matters relating to equalisation and allocation methods for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

The work undertaken to date has been to produce a first draft revision of the Guidelines.</p>  <p>  I considered it essential to broaden the review of the Guidelines to a more formal public consultation, both for quality assurance and to address the need for openness and inclusiveness.  A wide-scale formal public consultative process commenced on 1 December 2016 and closed on 28 February 2017.  My Department is currently reviewing the feedback received through the process before submitting the findings to me. I would expect to be in a position to conclude the consideration of this matter later in Q2 2017.</p></reply>

While there is no specific mention of car wash facilities in water pollution legislation, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts do provide that nobody should discharge or cause or permit the discharge of any trade effluent or sewage effluent to any waters except where licensed by a local authority.  Local authorities have a general responsibility for the monitoring, management, protection and improvement of water quality.

The plan sets out the strategic objectives for the delivery of water services by Irish Water over the 25 year period up to 2040.  It details current and future challenges which affect the provision of water services and identifies the priorities to be tackled by Irish Water in both the short and medium term.</p><p>The plan includes a number of key targets and indicators so that implementation of the plan can be monitored.  These include targets for achieving compliance with drinking water quality standards, targets for addressing legacy failings in relation to urban waste water treatment, targets for reduced leakage rates and lead management as well as targets for improving operational and capital efficiencies identified by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p><p>The Water Services Strategic Plan was approved by the then Minister in October 2015.  It provides the first real opportunity to take a long-term view of water services investment at a national level, to ensure that investment is strategically targeted towards priority needs and to put in place an asset management approach towards investment in water services that gives the optimum balance between capital and operational spend to ensure the required service delivery to the people of Ireland over time, and at least cost.  The Irish Water Business Plan <i>Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021</i>was also published in 2015.  It outlines Irish Water&rsquo;s planned investment and financial targets for the 7-year period to 2021 and provides the basis by which Irish Water will implement the first phase of the Water Services Strategic Plan.</p><p>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has produced a framework to monitor Irish Water's performance over time. Performance metrics cover the areas of customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply security of supply and sewerage service.  In addition, Ervia's Annual Report and Accounts and Irish Water's Financial statements are submitted to me each year and are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These publications enable further assessment of the progress made by Irish Water towards delivering the Water Services Strategic Plan and Business Plan targets.</p><p>Delivering the targets set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan will however be dependent upon ensuring the required levels of funding identified in the Irish Water Business Plan to 2021 and ongoing commitment to the required funding levels beyond then.</p></reply>

I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks, outlining the timelines for implementation of the various elements. </p><p>As part of the overall review, and having regard to a recent ECJ Judgement in Case C-290/15 on the Belgian/Wallonian wind energy regulatory order, it is proposed to undertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the proposed revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines before they come into effect. This assessment will be in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.</p><p>SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>The SEA process comprises a number of stages including: screening, scoping, environmental assessment, public consultation and implementation.  </p><p>Screening is a process which considers whether a particular plan or programme, other than those for which SEA is mandatory, would be likely to have significant environmental effects, and would thus warrant SEA.  Scoping is the procedure whereby the range of environmental issues and the level of detail to be included in the SEA Environmental Report are decided upon, in consultation with the prescribed environmental authorities.  The environmental assessment stage identifies, describes and evaluates any likely significant effects on the environment of implementing the proposed plan or programme.  Following this, the SEA Environmental Report and draft Plan (i.e. the Draft Revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines) are put out to public consultation, which is likely to be for a period of 6 to 8 weeks in this case.  The outcome of the public consultation must then be taken into account, together with the integration of environmental considerations, prior to the plan or being finalised and adopted. In the case of the Wind Energy Development Guidelines, a SEA Statement (Information on Decision) will then be published by my Department when the plan is formally adopted.</p><p>It is currently estimated that the SEA process in relation to the proposed revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines will take approximately 6 months.</p><p>There have been a number of SEAs recently carried out on national-level plans and programmes across a number of sectors, such as the SEA conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine for the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020, as well as the SEAs that my Department is presently undertaking in relation to the proposed National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040 - Our Plan and the Draft River Basin Management Plan for Ireland (2018-2021).  </p><p>In line with the requirements of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), any procurement undertaken by my Department in respect of the SEA process on the Wind Energy Development Guidelines will comply with national and EU procurement rules and procedures as advised on the OGP website , and in accordance with associated guidelines provided on the eTenders website , which is managed by the OGP.  It is expected that it will take approximately 3 months to complete the tender process in this regard.</p><p>In light of the these requirements, which it is estimated will take approximately 9 months in total, it is likely that while the draft proposals for revised Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines themselves will not be finalised and come into effect until the end of the year.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for a consolidated Rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.  Among the measures being considered for inclusion in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support specific national and local policy objectives. </p>  <p>  My Department's work on the General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage and, subject to Government approval, I hope to be able to submit proposals to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny shortly.</p></reply>

Such employees are treated in exactly the same way as other employees. This ensures that people employed as carers (and employees paying Class A generally) have access to short-term social insurance benefits, such as jobseekers or illness benefits in the event that they become unemployed or ill, as well as ensuring that they can establish entitlement to longer term benefits such as the contributory state pension.  </p>  <p>  Exempting such employments from a PRSI liability while at the same time granting PRSI contributions and associated rights to benefits and pensions (as if the contributions had been paid) would represent a major departure for the social insurance system.

In view of the ongoing difficulties in the rental market, my Department provides a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits, which were increased in July 2016.  In addition, the Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold is operational in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Kildare, Dublin, Cork, Meath, Wicklow and Galway City.  Since the introduction of this flexible approach, almost 11,500 tenants at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments. </p>  <p>  Continued entitlement to rent supplement is not linked to entitlement to other social welfare schemes, however the rent supplement claim may be reviewed following a decision to suspend or disallow a primary social welfare payment as there may be a change to the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances that could affect eligibility.  During a review of a rent supplement claim, the Community Welfare Service (CWS) officer will engage with the claimant to establish continued eligibility as quickly as possible and limit any delay to payments.  Any person in this situation is encouraged to contact the Department&rsquo;s CWS responsible for their rent supplement claim to discuss their situation. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an additional 500 places on the RSS.  These places have been available with effect from 1st February 2017.  This is the first increase in places since 2006 and will expand the overall number of participants from 2,600 to 3,100.</p>  <p>  My Department also delivers community employment (CE) which is part of a range of schemes that are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  CE schemes provide part-time temporary work in their local communities, including opportunities for training and development as a stepping-stone back to employment, for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments, including those on a long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  </p>  <p>  I have no plans to include a formal training element in the RSS scheme as there is an opportunity for training provided under CE, as outlined above.  However, my Department is committed to continuing to enhance the effectiveness of RSS.  It recognises the benefits the RSS provides for participants and their families, including enhancing existing skills and developing new skills through the scheme, as well as the valuable contribution the scheme is making to the provision of services in communities across Ireland. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The activation services and schemes are provided directly by the Intreo Case Officers; by private companies such as the JobPath companies, the Local Employment Services and Job Clubs or through Community Employment Schemes such as CE and T&uacute;s.  The aim of activation is to help the jobseeker secure and sustain full-time employment.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a policy of referring jobseekers to JobPath in preference to CE Scheme.  However, Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to allow the scheme and service providers time to work with the participants to achieve the best outcome for the person, it also ensures that the best use is made of places available across all the activation supports available. </p>  <p>  The JobPath service is provided for jobseekers that have been unemployed for at least a year; Selection for JobPath is based on a random selection of eligible jobseekers who are not engaged with another activation support at the time of selection.  Where a person is selected for JobPath, and they already have received an offer of a placement on a CE Scheme which is commencing within four weeks, my Department will facilitate the customer to take up the placement, similarly a person on a CE Scheme will not be available for selection for JobPath until their placement on the CE scheme is complete.  </p>  <p>  Each person referred to the JobPath service is allocated a personal advisor who provides intensive individual support and assistance.   When a jobseeker with JobPath finds employment, they will be supported by the JobPath Company for at least the first 13 weeks and up to a year until they are settled in the job.  This is in contrast to the Community Employment schemes that provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments.  Community Employment does not, nor is intended to provide full-time sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  The referral period for the JobPath service is typically for a year.

To facilitate this more intensive engagement, caseloads were reduced.  The number of local employment service mediators also increased from (circa) 163 in 2015 to (circa) 170 in 2017 and there is no plan to replace them.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Public Employment Service (PES) is managed by my Department and delivered directly by its own Intreo service as well as by contracted private companies i.e. the JobPath companies, the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.</p>  <p>  The LES engages primarily with long-term unemployed jobseekers but may also engage with short-term unemployed jobseekers where a local need arises.  Jobseekers are referred directly to the LES by Intreo offices.  Jobseekers may also request services from the LES on a &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; basis.  Other groups, to whom the LES offer services, include people with a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, ex-offenders, members of the travelling community and refugees.  Where these people initially present at an Intreo office they may be sent to the LES for activation services.</p>  <p>  For 2017 my Department has contracted 22 private contractors for the provision of LES in 26 locations.  The funding for LES has been maintained at &euro;20m and there is no plan at this time to reduce expenditure. </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Intreo and JobPath my Department had a total of (circa) 300 case officers (including LES) working with over 460,000 people on the live register, i.e. a caseload of over 1,500 people : 1 Case Office against international benchmark of less than 200:1.  My Department has increased the number of case officers to approx. 1,250, including i Intreo and JobPath services.  With the reduction in the unemployment rate from a peak of 15% (Feb 2012) to 7.2% (Jan 2017) and the live register now at approx. 276,000 people, the average caseload today is around 230:1.  My Department is seeking to maintain LES and JobPath caseload ratio of 100/125:1 which is in line with OECD caseload benchmarks.</p></reply>

Management of Ireland&rsquo;s European Social Fund (ESF) Operational Programme, which includes the YEI, is carried out by the ESF Managing Authority, within the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The YEI is integrated into ESF programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF co-financed Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  PEIL includes proposed allocations for over 20 activities, including the YEI, being implemented across a range of bodies, and contains a total budget of &euro;1.153 billion for the period 2014-2020 comprising ESF and Exchequer contributions of &euro;542.43m each and the YEI budget contribution of &euro;68.145m. </p>  <p>  Seven actions were originally selected for YEI funding, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge (now closed to new participants from October 2016); JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach, Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and Momentum.  </p>  <p>  The YEI and related ESF funding is available for drawdown before the end of 2018, and while a claim for funding has not been made to date it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down.  The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and can re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  The PMC has agreed in principle to the inclusion of Community Training Centres, which are funded by the Education and Training Boards in consultation with SOLAS, as an approved activity under the YEI with effect from 1 January 2017.   </p>  <p>  I am informed that while no claim for funding has been made to date, the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer and there is therefore no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.</p>  <p>  Under the ESF Regulations, initial and annual pre-financing is provided by the Commission, resulting in receipts of &euro;51.8m for the PEIL to date.  Of this &euro;51.8m, &euro;28.3m relates to ESF advances and &euro;23.5m relates to YEI advances.  &euro;20.4m (&euro;18m ESF and &euro;2.4m YEI) of these receipts have been distributed, while the remaining &euro;31.4m (&euro;10.3m ESF and &euro;21.1m YEI) has or will be reimbursed to the Commission in the absence of a claim being made.  Work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Education and Skills expects that this designation work will be completed in the coming months and that it is proposed to commence the preparation of a first interim claim for payment from the Commission once the process of designation has concluded.  This claim will be made within the EU Regulatory deadlines to ensure no loss of ESF or YEI receipts.</p></reply>

Therefore the overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs. </p>  <p>  The payments made are in respect of registration fees, paid for clients who have engaged with the service, and fees paid for sustained employment outcomes of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks duration.

The additional capacity was and is essential, to facilitate meaningful engagement with all those who are unemployed &ndash; in particular the long-term unemployed (who need more intensive levels of engagement).</p>  <p>  Given the nature of the resourcing requirement, that contracted service provision is common practice in EU/OECD countries and given that the use of contracted service provision was suggested by the NESC and OECD, among others, and given the constraints on Exchequer finances, it was concluded that a contracted, payment by results model, was the most appropriate approach. </p>  <p>  In November 2012, following a public procurement competition, the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (&lsquo;CESI&rsquo; a UK based leading not-for-profit company dedicated to tackling disadvantage and promoting social inclusion in the labour market) was appointed to provide the Department with expert advice and assistance relating to the design and delivery of an employment service model (&ldquo;JobPath&rdquo;) </p>  <p>  Based on its knowledge of the operation of contracted employment services in other States, CESI provided advice with regard to the design of the JobPath model including detailed financial modelling of a payment by results approach in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The JobPath contract model was designed over an extended period taking account of advice from Irish and international experts on contracting of employment services and inputs received following a number of public stakeholder consultations/briefings. </p>  <p>  On 12 December 2013, the Department published a contract notice inviting tenders for the provision of JobPath services.  The Tender documentation was published on www.etenders.gov.ie  while information on JobPath was published and continues to be available on www.welfare.ie. </p>  <p>  The Request for Tenders (RFT) details all aspects of the JobPath Service, including the fact that it is intended to function as a payment by results model.  This means that all initial outlay expenditure, such as costs of premises, staff recruitment and training, etc.  are borne by the  provider companies.</p>  <p>  The RFT advised that the successful tenderers must have the ability to satisfy the Service Contract requirements in terms of scale and duration, and were therefore required to demonstrate a cash generation sufficient to undertake the provision of the JobPath Service, and be in a sufficiently robust position to service debt obligations and contingencies or other liabilities which may arise over the term of the Agreement.  Potential tenderers were advised that they may rely on the financial resources of other entities for the purposes of demonstrating their economic and financial standing, but they must demonstrate that they had the capacity to raise the finance required to deliver the service.</p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, participation by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the procurement exercise was specifically referenced in the introduction to the RFT.  Per paragraph 1.5 on page 5 of the RFT it is stated that SMEs who believed that the scope of the procurement was beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Through such relationships they would be enabled to participate in and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements arising from the competition.  In addition, larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be involved in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts  resulting from this particular public procurement competition.</p>  <p>  The RFT did not, therefore, preclude the submission of tenders by any company, or amalgamation of companies, and it is not the case that the intention was to award contracts exclusively to large private companies. </p>  <p>  Contracts were awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on the following criteria (i) cost, (ii) implementation of services, (iii) delivery of services and (iv) contract management and governance.  Full details of the JobPath procurement requirements and evaluation criteria used during the tender process are set out in the &ldquo;Request for Tenders for the Provision of Employment Services (JobPath)&rdquo;, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/JobPath.aspx. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the two companies can and do engaged with a range of other companies for the provision of various services and they employ some 600 people either themselves or through sub-contracted relationships.</p>  <p>  Finally as in previous years, for 2017 the department has contracts in place with in excess of 60 companies for the provision of the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  In addition, the Department also contracts with other companies for the delivery of community employment schemes and community service programmes.  The Department therefore has and continues to have contracts for the provision of services with a wide variety of organisations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to around 627,000 families in respect of some 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2017. </p><p>Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for Child Benefit from 19 years to less than 18 years.  A value for money review of child income supports, published by the Department of Social Protection in 2010, found that the participation pattern of children in education supports the current age limit for Child Benefit. </p><p>Changing the guidelines of the Child Benefit payment to include 18 year olds that are still in school to be in receipt of the payment would not be a targeted approach given the universality of Child Benefit.  The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>-  qualified child increases (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>-  family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children; </p><p>-  the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second level education rate). </p><p>I am satisfied these schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p></reply>

Two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have been contracted by the Department to deliver the JobPath service.</p>  <p>  Clients receive support for 52 weeks but this period may continue for up to 130 weeks e.g. where a person engages in further education/training (for up to 26 weeks) prior to securing employment and for at least 3 months and up to up to 52 weeks, while in employment.

However, CE and T&uacute;s placements are not full time sustainable jobs.</p>  <p>  A person who is referred to JobPath, who has a start date for commencement on T&uacute;s or CE within four weeks, is not required to take up the place on JobPath.  In addition people who have completed their year long engagement with JobPath may, if eligible, apply to partake in a CE Scheme after they have been assessed by a departmental case officer. </p>  <p>  Any CE or T&uacute;s scheme experiencing issues with recruitment can contact their local Intreo office for additional assistance.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each person referred to the JobPath service is allocated a personal advisor who provides intensive individual support and assistance.  When a jobseeker with JobPath finds employment, they will be supported by the JobPath Company for at least the first 13 weeks and up to a year until they are settled in the job. </p>  <p>  This is in contrast to the Community Employment schemes that provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments.

At present, entitlement to the contributory pension is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (i.e. the period between when they first entered insurable employment and the year of pension age).  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  Payment rates are banded, e.g., someone with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20-29 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. </p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a significant cost.  The main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who don&rsquo;t therefore qualify for a means-tested payment.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform</p>  <p>  The forthcoming independent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options available under the Total Contributions Approach currently being developed.  Following the analysis of that data, it is intended to have a public consultation, in mid-2017, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.</p>  <p>  People claiming supports under the SWA scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment (ENP) or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement.  The availability of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.  However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events, local management assesses the response required to ensure that supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  This may include provision of emergency or out of hours services and may be supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls.</p>  <p>  My Department may provide an ENP to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) can be paid as a once-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time, for example in the aftermath of a domestic fire or other event where the people affected have an immediate need for support.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for ENPs and UNPs in 2017.</p>  <p>  There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP, it is payable at the discretion of the Department&rsquo;s representative, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.</p>  <p>  Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP scheme, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  Some 2,900 ENPs for assistance with funeral and burial costs issued in 2016 at a total cost of approximately &euro;5 million.  This compares with some 3,000 payments at a cost of &euro;5 million in 2015.</p>  <p>  Any persons who consider that they have an entitlement to assistance under the SWA scheme should contact my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that the SWA scheme is kept under review to ensure that the CWS continues to support those most in need of assistance.</p></reply>

The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need and reflects the position that persons with reasonable amounts of income, capital and property are in a position to use that resource to support themselves.</p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme is supporting some 44,800 tenants for which the Government has provided &euro;253 million for in 2017.  The scheme is generally available to people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and do not have alternative accommodation available.  Rent supplement&rsquo;s means test is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are required, subject to income disregards, to contribute a proportion of assessable means towards their accommodation costs.  As part of this means test, a capital assessment is completed which includes savings, investments, property (other than the family home) and would include any monies realised following a settlement outlined by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The Department has no role in financial and other settlements made between couples on separation, divorce or otherwise.  Any capital owned by a person involved in such a settlement is assessed in the normal way for the purposes of means tested schemes and the appropriate disregards apply.

The rate of payment to a person is related to the number of contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Entitlement levels are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.</p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.</p>  <p>  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for a means-tested payment.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.</p>  <p>  Following on from the proposal in the National Pensions Framework (2010) that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020, officials of my Department are currently working on its detailed development, with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

According to the records of the Department, he has a total of 1,575 reckonable paid and credited contributions from that date of entry into insurance to end-December 2016 (the last complete contribution year prior to reaching pension age).  This gives a yearly average of 32, which qualifies him for a reduced-rate state pension (contributory) of 90% of maximum rate, with effect from 8 April 2017.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  59.2% of the 23,220 appeals finalised in 2016 and 56.25% of the 5,000 appeals finalised to date in 2017 had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 16,990 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 3,641 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers to the end of March 2017, 1,526 (41.9%) were determined following an oral hearing.  (61.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong.</p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.  This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 and some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>In addition, where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing.  An example of this would be where the appeal question relates to PRSI contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.</p><p>I trust this

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.991.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100083#WRZ00400"><p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 13.9% (29,700 persons) in March 2017 estimated by CSO, as compared to 17.3% (33,700 persons) in March 2016 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012.</p><p>While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes for all programmes, some indicative figures are available for people aged under 25 at a national level.  For example:</p><p>- The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey. Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).</p><p>- JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefiting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.</p><p>- In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, out of a possible maximum of 5.  Results from the 2016 Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.</p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. </p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth. Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020</i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment:</p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;</p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;</p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers</p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  </p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.</p><p>I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people.</p></reply>

On Budget Day, I was pleased to announce a number of important measures which will benefit the self-employed. </p>  <p>  From the last week in March, the self-employed now have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended, for all workers including the self-employed, from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017. For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  These measures will affect more than 300,000 self-employed contributors.</p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports. </p>  <p>  All of the self-employed improvements were introduced without any increase in the 2017 rate of PRSI contribution paid by self-employed workers.</p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets. In this regard, in 2017, my Department will carry out detailed work to establish how to provide a better safety net for self-employed including, for example, access to schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

Reports about this man&rsquo;s health are a matter of the utmost concern to the Government.  In light if these concerns the Government took the unprecedented step last month of making arrangements for an Irish doctor, nominated by the Chief Medical Officer, to visit him in prison and to make an assessment of his health.</p>  <p>  While the doctor&rsquo;s findings are, of course, a private and confidential matter, I can confirm that the Irish doctor shared his assessment and recommendations with the prison authorities who have a clear responsibility to ensure this man&rsquo;s welfare while he remains within the Egyptian prison system. The Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have consistently underlined our concerns in all contacts with Egyptian interlocutors and made clear that we expect them to fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this man&rsquo;s welfare and well-being.  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Cairo is continuing to follow up on these matters.</p>  <p>  I have been concerned by persistent reports that the citizen in question is pursuing a hunger strike.  The Government has consistently stressed to him and to his family that he should not pursue such a course of action, which will only be damaging to his well-being and his cause, and that he should look after his health by eating properly and cooperating with medical tests and investigations that are arranged on his behalf.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has in recent days renewed the Government&rsquo;s appeal to the Egyptian President to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay.  This is the Government&rsquo;s objective, and we are working day-in and day-out to seek to secure that outcome. </p>  <p>  The court case in which this person is accused is now moving forward at a much more accelerated pace.  At the most recent hearing in the case, on 5 April, 11 more witnesses were called and cross-examined.  Also at that hearing, lawyers representing our Irish citizen made a request for his release on health grounds and the presiding Judge undertook to examine the matter.  The same judge has previously ordered on a number of occasions, that there should be medical evaluations of this man&rsquo;s health.  The next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 26 April.  Officials from the Irish Embassy will again be in court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing in the case to date.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador and his team in Cairo have done exceptional work on this case with an unprecedented number of consular visits being undertaken to ensure that this citizen&rsquo;s health and welfare is monitored and that any concerns are immediately followed up with the responsible authorities.</p></reply>

My EU counterparts and I also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Abou El Gheit.  The conflict in Syria is causing untold suffering and displacement of civilians on the ground. At the Council meeting, I and my EU counterparts condemned once again the continued systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, especially the Syrian regime.  We made clear that the Syrian regime has the primary responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population, and call upon the regime and its allies, notably Russia, to undertake all efforts to ensure a full cessation of hostilities; the lifting of sieges; and full unhindered sustainable country-wide humanitarian access.</p>  <p>  Ireland's humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Syria crisis reached &euro;76 million as of March 2017, and we pledged a further &euro;25 million at the recent conference on &ldquo;Supporting the future of Syria and the region&rdquo; which was held in Brussels on Wednesday 5 April.  This is Irish Aid's largest response to a single crisis in recent years, which is indicative of the level of priority we attach to the issue. </p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers also discussed the severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is also of grave concern.  I have previously discussed Yemen with my counterparts in the Gulf region, and raised concerns about the humanitarian situation and attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.  I and my EU colleagues reiterated our strong support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to achieve a resumption of negotiations and called on all parties to urgently agree on a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by the UN as a first step towards the resumption of peace talks under UN leadership. Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since the conflict began and will maintain our support in 2017.</p>  <p>  The Council also discussed the political situation in Libya, and the urgent need for a political solution that would unite the country under the Libyan Peace Agreement.</p>  <p>  This was the first meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council since the UK formally triggered Article 50 on 29 March and the circulation of the draft negotiation guidelines on 31 March.  I continued my extensive engagement with EU counterparts by having bilateral meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Austria respectively to discuss ongoing preparations for the upcoming Brexit negotiations and Ireland&rsquo;s priority issues, namely the economy, Northern Ireland, the Common Travel Area and our vision for the future of the EU.</p></reply>

I was horrified to learn of the apparent chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun last week which killed scores of civilians and seriously injured many more.  The attack was simply barbaric, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families. I condemn unreservedly the attack and those responsible.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of course of the US missile strikes on Shayrat Airfield in Syria.  I understand that the US intention was to prevent further chemical attacks.  The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, issued a statement on behalf of EU Member States in response to those missile strikes.</p>  <p>  The attack in Khan Sheikhoun further underlines the need for accountability and a genuine political transition in Syria. The search for a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict, and, as part of that, ensuring full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria, is a top foreign policy priority for Ireland.</p>  <p>I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria with EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council last week. My EU colleagues joined me in condemning the continued widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, especially the Syrian regime.  We also agreed the new EU Strategy for Syria, and reiterated our position that there can be no EU support for reconstruction until a comprehensive, genuine and inclusive political transition, owned by the Syrian people, is firmly under way.     </p>  <p>  Minister of State McHugh attended the Conference on supporting the future of Syria and the Region in Brussels last Wednesday at which Ireland pledged an additional &euro;25million in humanitarian assistance for Syria and the neighbouring refugee hosting countries in 2017.  Ireland has already contributed &euro;76.5 million to the humanitarian effort in Syria.  This is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest response to a single crisis in recent years, which is indicative of the level of priority we attach to this issue.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led Geneva peace process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura and remains committed to supporting efforts towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  It remains to be seen how the events of the past week will impact on these efforts.</p></reply>

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.  In this context I am representing the Government in the ongoing intensive talks in Belfast.  The talks have two objectives. Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.  These current discussions structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments follow on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.</p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved - including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.</p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent days, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the new Executive will be in place as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.</p>  <p>  I will continue to participate in the discussions in Belfast this week as required, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement the Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and protect its institutions.</p>  <p>  While time is extremely tight, I remain hopeful of a positive outcome to the discussions, and strongly urge all parties to work intensively and cooperatively, to secure the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and ensure effective devolved government, as was so evidently voted for by the people in Northern Ireland in the recent election.</p></reply>

Applicants are advised that this is a target rather than a guarantee of service and that turnaround times will vary depending on factors such as seasonal demand.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a surge in passport applications in recent months. Between 1 January and 31 March over 250,000 applications were received, representing an increase of 26% over the same period last year. The average processing time for renewal applications submitted through the An Post Passport Express service is 16 working days, one day over the target 15 working day turnaround and this has been notified to An Post.</p><p>First-time applications and those for renewal of lost or stolen passports are subject to longer turnaround times due to the extra verification steps involved (current turnaround time is 24 working days).  My Department keeps An Post apprised of changes to the advised turnaround times for each category of applicant and these are updated weekly on the Passport Service website.  In all cases, applicants are strongly encouraged to allow at least six weeks for the processing of a passport and to submit their application through Passport Express only if they have no immediate travel plans i.e. if they are travelling in three weeks or more.</p><p>The new online passport application service for adult renewals will result in considerable efficiencies and will alleviate pressure on passport processing.  This service offers a target turnaround of ten working days (two weeks), plus postage.  It is convenient and secure and I would urge the Deputy to encourage eligible applicants to use this channel via the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dfa.ie.</i></p><p>I would also ask the Deputy to promote the Passport Service&rsquo;s free email reminder facility, which alerts a passport holder when his or her passport is coming due for renewal.  The service can be accessed at: <i>www.dfa.ie/passports-citizenship/top-passport-questions/when-should-i-apply-for-a-new-passport/.</i></p></reply>

Ireland has focused in particular on settlement expansion, and on related issues demolitions, evictions and expropriations, but also on a broader range of concerns such as the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli security forces, restrictions on the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need, and restriction of access to water supplies.

I also urge the Government of Paraguay, the members of the Paraguayan Congress and Senate and the Supreme Court to ensure that any amendment to the national constitution is carried out in manner consistent with the rules and procedures set down to that end and that due attention be paid to the concerns of civil society and the public at large.</p>  <p>  Paraguay has over the last ten years undertaken important reforms which have created the basis for economic growth.  I hope that current political tensions will de-escalate and attention will focus once again on the future development of the State and the economy for the benefit of all its people.</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Asuncion, the situation in Paraguay is being followed closely by the accredited Embassy in Buenos Aires.</p></reply>

The attack was simply barbaric, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families.  I condemn unreservedly the attack and those responsible.</p>  <p>  My EU colleagues and I have denounced the attack, both individually and as a group.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have remained in constant contact with our EU counterparts over the past week. We have also had engagement with many other governments at official level through our network of missions abroad.</p>  <p>  Just before this attack occurred, I had the opportunity to discuss the overall situation in Syria in person with EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday of last week.  In our conclusions we condemned the continued widespread abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, especially the Syrian regime.  We also agreed the new EU Strategy for Syria, and reiterated our position that there can be no support for reconstruction until a comprehensive, genuine and inclusive political transition, owned by the Syrian people, is firmly under way.</p>  <p>  Following the apparent chemical attacks in Khan Sheikoun on Tuesday, we also issued joint statement condemning the attack in the strongest terms. </p>  <p>  Minister of State McHugh attended the Conference on supporting the future of Syria and the Region in Brussels last Wednesday at which he had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria in general and the attack in Khan Sheikoun in particular with several of his counterparts from around the world. </p>  <p>  At this conference Ireland pledged an additional &euro;25million in humanitarian assistance for Syria and the neighbouring refugee hosting countries in 2017. Ireland has already contributed &euro;76.5 million to the humanitarian effort in Syria. This is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest response to a single crisis in recent years, which is indicative of the level of priority we attach to this issue.</p>  <p>  In parallel, Ireland continues to call for full accountability for full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  In December, Ireland worked with a group of like-minded countries to successfully press for the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly to establish an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism to investigate and prosecute these most serious crimes in Syria.  We also continue to support Security Council referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the UN-led Geneva peace process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura and remains in constant contact with our UN partners to support the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p></reply>

This is the Government&rsquo;s objective, and we are working day-in and day-out to seek to secure that outcome.   I repeated this position when I met my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry, again face-to-face last month.  In recent days I have also spoken again with EU High Representative Mogherini about the case and I also availed of the opportunity of my meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, who is also a former Egyptian Foreign Minister, to enlist his assistance in trying to persuade the Egyptian authorities to release this man.  </p>  <p>  The court case in which this person is accused is now moving forward at a more accelerated pace.  At the most recent hearing in the case, on 5 April, eleven more witnesses were called and cross-examined.  Also at that hearing, lawyers representing our Irish citizen made a request for his release on health grounds and the presiding Judge undertook to examine the matter.  The same judge has previously ordered on a number of occasions that there should be medical evaluations of this man&rsquo;s health.  The next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 26 April.  Officials from the Irish Embassy will again be in court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing in the case to date.</p>  <p>  For my part, I will be continuing to work urgently at the political level to maintain pressure on the Egyptian Government to release our citizen and allow him to return to his home and his family.</p></reply>

This Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific references to establishment of the comprehensive framework on the past provided for under the Stormont House Agreement, implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings, and pursuing a public inquiry into the murder of the late Pat Finucane.</p><p>In relation to the Dublin Monaghan bombings, the All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted in this House on 25 May last year has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.</p><p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, including at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.</p><p>In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government. Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.</p><p>The Government is continuing to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Taoiseach and I will also continue our engagement with party leaders in the Oireachtas on the issue.</p><p>In relation to the Kingsmill massacre, I understand that the inquest hearings into the deaths will shortly resume, following the decision of the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland in February not to proceed with a prosecution.  That there will not be a prosecution is a further disappointment to the families of the victims who died in this atrocity, and the sole survivor, who have waited so long for justice.</p><p>The Government has committed to full co-operation within the law with the Kingsmill inquest.  Further to this commitment, the Garda Authorities have worked with the Northern Ireland Coroner, and transfers of the relevant material, in accordance with the law, have taken place to the Coroner in support of the inquest.  The Irish Authorities remain in direct contact with the Northern Ireland Coroner, as part of an ongoing legal process of cooperation, to identify ways in which any further support or assistance can be given to the Inquest, in accordance with the law.</p><p>Regarding the case of the late Pat Finucane, I was glad to accept an invitation to deliver the annual Pat Finucane Memorial Lecture in Belfast on 23 February last.  In doing so, I reaffirmed the firm view and position of the Government that a satisfactory outcome will best be achieved through a full public inquiry into the appalling murder of Mr. Finucane, honouring the commitment made by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001.  We have made this position clear to the British Government on a number of occasions, including in recent discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, and will continue to do so.</p><p>Also, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers decided in December 2015, at Ireland&rsquo;s request, to consider a re-opening of measures in the case of Pat Finucane, when the domestic proceedings in Belfast have concluded.  This decision of the Committee of Minister was reaffirmed in December 2016 and the matter will next be considered by the Committee of Ministers in June as part of the review of the <i>McKerr</i>group of cases.  I am informed that the recent decision of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in this case may be the subject of a further appeal.</p><p>There are many families across all communities on these islands, and beyond, who continue to deal with the awful pain of losing a loved one, as well as with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  The Government is therefore committed to the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.  </p><p>In this regard, I am continuing to engage in the ongoing discussions in Belfast with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to seek a way forward for the early establishment of the Stormont House framework.  In these discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.</p><p>The Government will continue its intensive engagement with all parties to move forward with the Stormont House legacy framework, and I hope that this can be achieved in the very near future.</p></reply>

This built on earlier commitments to work together to optimise North South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.</p>  <p>  It was agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectorial level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.</p>  <p>  The Government hopes that as a result of the ongoing talks in Stormont,  in which I am participating,  a new Northern Ireland Executive will be in place shortly and that dates for the next round of NSMC meetings will be agreed as soon as possible thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The Executive is responsible for politically representing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, including in relation to the upcoming EU-UK negotiations.  With those negotiations due to begin shortly, it is essential that Ministerial engagement through the NSMC recommences at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  The Government is also working to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  The legal and political obligations of both the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain unchanged, regardless of the status of the UK within the EU, and the future EU-UK relationship.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister May have confirmed that the Agreement remains the basis for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government. T he Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.  In this context, I am representing the Government in the ongoing talks at Stormont Castle.  The discussions are focused on addressing outstanding issues, including the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, as well as on the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.  Dealing with outstanding issues from previous agreements is necessary to sustain confidence at this critical moment for devolution in Northern Ireland and, in accordance with previous agreements, this element of the discussions is being facilitated by the two Governments.</p>  <p>  The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We have been unstinting in our efforts to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to advance the full implementation of all its provisions. The Government will continue to work with the British Government and the political parties to fulfil the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement and to advance political stability, reconciliation and economic prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

In this context, we are of course also guided by the aspiration contained in Article 3 of the Constitution as amended by the people in 1998.</p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of a change in constitutional status in Northern Ireland is a fundamental part of the Good Friday Agreement, which was endorsed by the people of this island North and South.  The trigger for a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  This occurs when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in Northern Ireland in the near future would result in constitutional change.  In these circumstances such a poll might only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  In the absence of any prospect of a referendum in the near future, my Department is not preparing specific legislative scenarios for a united Ireland.  My immediate priority is to secure the future of the devolved power-sharing institutions, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am currently engaged in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland political parties to support the formation of a new Executive, as well as to address outstanding issues and commitments from previous Agreements.  The formation of a new Executive is all the more pressing and urgent now, so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances and concerns can be effectively represented in the challenging context of Brexit, as the EU-UK negotiations get underway.</p>  <p>  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government will continue its work to protect the peace process and ensure that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are respected in the forthcoming EU-UK negotiations.  As a co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government is also determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions.  To this end I will continue my engagement in the ongoing discussions with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland, to see the see devolved institutions restored and working effectively in the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.  The Deputy will appreciate that the prospect of any such referendum in the future would be a most significant step for the Government and for the country and the necessary scoping work could only proceed on the basis of extensive preparation and appropriate consultation.</p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work. In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those relating to a possible change in constitutional status for Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.</p></reply>

It  is essentially a discussion paper which contains much valuable food for thought both about the international context as it is now and may develop over the coming decade, as well as setting out a number of scenarios for how the EU might evolve and develop in the period ahead.  It takes an open and non-prescriptive approach and is presented as an initial contribution to a Europe-wide discussion and debate.  This approach is welcome and is in keeping with the need to renew the EU's contract with its citizens.  The promised publication later this year of more detailed papers on a range of specific issues will also contribute to the Europe-wide discussions that this White Paper seeks to initiate.</p>  <p>  It is important that all member States, national parliaments and citizens across Europe are involved in this discussion in the period ahead.  In the first instance, I would suggest that it might be appropriate for the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to take up consideration of the White Paper.</p>  <p>  The White Paper should also be seen in the light of the Declaration of twenty-seven Heads of State or Government, which issued in Rome to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the signature of the Treaty of Rome.  The Declaration acknowledges the issues facing the Union, while also stressing its achievements and strengths.  Looking to the future, it places the short-to-medium term focus very much on the concrete delivery of commitments already made across a range of areas of real concern to citizens.</p></reply>

It defines an established position as "a position in which established service is rendered".  Established service is defined in the same Act as "service in a capacity in respect of which a superannuation allowance may be granted under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1954".</p>  <p>  To a large extent the actual differences between established and unestablished service are historical, other than in the case of pensions.  Reflecting developments in employment law the rights of all civil servants are broadly the same.  In the past the fundamental differences between established and unestablished staff were (i) the basis of their tenure and (ii) their method of entry into the civil service. However, these differences no longer exist.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 provided for the abolition of the distinction in the tenure arrangements on the basis of whether a civil servant is established or unestablished and replaces it with a distinction based primarily on grade - where the Secretary General is responsible for the management of staff at assistant principal, and equivalent, and below, and the Minister is responsible for the management of grades above that level.</p>  <p>  Similarly the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 means that the framework under which recruitment to the public service is carried out is now the same for all civil servants, whether established or unestablished.  All civil servants are covered by the provisions of the Act and this means that whether staff are established or unestablished their entry route to the civil service is the same.  Notwithstanding this because established civil servants cannot be employed under an employment contract - other than a probationary contract - any staff employed on contract will therefore hold unestablished status.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of civil servants are determined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under section 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 and civil servants, whether established or unestablished, generally have the same statutory and non-statutory conditions of employment.</p>  <p>  There are some differences in the pension terms and the retirement ages that apply to established and unestablished civil servants.  In general, for those who entered prior to 1 April 2004, and who are established civil servants, excluding prison officers, the minimum pension age is 60 and the maximum retirement age is 65, while non-established state employees have a minimum pension age of 65 and a maximum retirement age of 65/66.  In general, those appointed on or after 1 April 2004 and before 1 January 2013, whether established, excluding prison officers, or non-established, have a minimum pension age of 65 and no maximum retirement age.  Members of the single scheme, in general those appointed on or after 1 January 2013, whether established, excluding prison officers, or non-established have a minimum pension age of 66, rising in step with state pension age increases to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  Retirement is compulsory when a member of the single scheme reaches 70 years of age.</p></reply>

The group, whose report was agreed by Government last August, considered policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors, examining implications arising from retirement ages now and in the future.  The Group identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and employer bodies for follow-up in that regard.  A copy of the report is available online at <i>.</i></p><p>On foot of one of the recommendations of the report, my Department, with public service employers, was tasked to review the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current age of entitlement to the contributory state pension.  This review is currently underway and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2017.  Future policy in this area will be considered by Government following the outcome of this review.</p><p>Any change in the compulsory retirement ages for public servants will require primary legislation.</p></reply>

The flood maps were developed, making use of the information available at the time, including information on the event of November 2009, which was the most extreme on record by a significant margin.  The subsequent flood event of the Winter of 2015-2016 was exceptionally severe, more extreme even than the Shannon flood of November 2009.  The area had hence suffered two particularly extreme floods in recent years.  Based on this and information that was collated and provided over the months after the flood, the OPW decided to undertake a review of the flood maps.</p>  <p>  The OPW accordingly commissioned its consultants to undertake a review in the Autumn 2016.  The outcome of this review has been a slight increase in the design flood levels in the lower Shannon in this area.  The assessment of options in this area has therefore also been reviewed to determine if potentially viable options for flood risk management measures might be available.  This work has involved re-examining the flood damages, the possible options and the economic justification for the options. </p>  <p>  A potentially viable option for flood risk management has been found, based principally on flood defences, with some pumping required to remove rainwater falling behind the defences during times of flood.  The proposed option has a standard of protection of a 1000-yr flood, a 0.1% annual exceedence probability, which is above the normal standard and so offers a very robust level of protection.  The measure will protect the homes in the area that are prone to flooding, and also the road providing access to the properties that are elevated above the past flood levels such that access and egress to these properties would be maintained during times of flood once the flood protection measures are in place.</p>  <p>  The revised maps and the proposed option for managing the flood risk in Clonlara as described above were presented to the public for consultation at a local Public Consultation Day held on Thursday 23 March.  A large number of people from the community attended, with a generally positive response.</p>  <p>  The responses and feedback from the consultation will now be reviewed by the OPW and its consultants, and a proposed measure will be set out in the final flood risk management plans.  Once the plans are approved, the measures set out in the plans may be progressed through detailed design and the relevant planning and approval processes on towards construction.</p>  <p>  The current position regarding the CFRAM Programme is that the flood risk management plans are now being finalised and this process is near completion.  A prioritised list of feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, will be drawn up to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner. The plans will then be submitted for approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and subsequently for the adoption by the local authorities.</p></reply>

As part of that process, a series of public meetings were convened, in addition to written submissions being sought from both the public and key stakeholders alike.</p><p>In order to assist in the process, the services of Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, NUIG, were engaged by my Department to prepare a report summarising the key conclusions of the public consultation process and to identify key strategic priorities for the coming years.  This draft report has been submitted to the Advisory Committee established to advise on the implementation of the Strategy for its consideration.  Following receipt of the Advisory Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, it is my intention to publish, by mid-2017, an action plan for the period 2017-2022 which will contain specified strategic priorities for the next five years along with a timeline for their implementation. </p><p>A copy of An tAcadamh&rsquo;s report can be found at: </p></reply>

The risks to species listed for the nearest sites were dealt with in the Appropriate Assessment Stage 1 Screening Report. </p>  <p>  An NIS or EIS is not necessarily required for a project.  The site proposed in the application is not within any currently designated Natura site.  Under Regulation 42 of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulation S.I. 411of 2011, any plan or project must be screened for Appropriate Assessment.  The proposed development was screened out in the proponents&rsquo; report, which provided a scientific rationale to assert that there were no likely significant effects on listed species for nearby Natura sites. </p>  <p>  The requirement for an Environmental Impact Statement is set out in the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulation S.I.349 of 1989 and amendments.  In documentation supporting the application it was concluded that the proposed development of the test site does not conform to the definitions provided by Annex I of Council Directive 85/337/EEC and amendments.  The decision related to the requirements for an NIS/EIS will be made by Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as part of its statutory role.</p></reply>

I understand that Foras na Gaeilge has pressing accommodation requirements which arise, principally, from the ending of the long-term leases on its current headquarters on Merrion Square and its office in North Frederick Street.  Accordingly, in accordance with section 5 of its Financial Memorandum, Foras na Gaeilge submitted a comprehensive business case to its two Sponsor Departments seeking approval for a proposal to move to a new headquarters in Amiens Street.  Following consideration of the business case, both Sponsor Departments gave approval in principle for the move earlier this year.  Both Departments are currently considering a request for final approval of the proposal.</p></reply>

Since 1 May 2015, young people are encouraged to join the private health insurance market at an earlier age and thus avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older.  Previous periods of health insurance cover are taken into account in calculating the loading that may apply to individuals, whereby the level of loading is reduced by the relevant credited period(s).  These credited periods apply to community-rated health insurance cover with registered health insurers in this country only.</p>  <p>  Civil servants serving as diplomats in the Department of Foreign Affairs are generally posted abroad on a number of separate occasions during the course of their career.  The Department of Foreign Affairs offer their civil servants posted abroad a policy providing international cover (the cost of which is partly subsidised by that Department).  International health care plan such as VHI Global is not a health insurance contract within the meaning of health insurance legislation i.e. they are not subject to community rating, risk equalisation, minimum benefits etc.  For the purposes of Lifetime Community Rating, an insured person must have a continuous period of cover under an in-patient indemnity health insurance contract effected by a registered health insurer.  As policies such as VHI Global do not meet this legislative requirement, civil servants holding that policy while assigned abroad are subject to Lifetime Community Rating rules if they choose to take out voluntary health insurance on return to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have advised colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that a review of Lifetime Community Rating, after 30 April 2017, is provided for in the regulations.  The Health Insurance Authority, as the independent regulator, recently carried out a public consultation process (closing date 3 March 2017) as the first phase of its review of the regulations.  The Authority is now in the process of considering all of the submissions received and will submit its report and recommendations to me in due course.</p></reply>

Actuarial projections are part based on historical claims spend, claims activity and future reasonably foreseeable activity taking into account relevant risk factors.  The actuaries provide projections to the Agency on a best estimate basis, intended to represent the expected value of the distribution of these reasonably foreseeable claims outcomes in order to predict the yearly cost of managing the Clinical Indemnity Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Clinical Indemnity Scheme was established in 2002, and was extended to include consultants working in public hospitals from 1 February 2004.  It is important to note that  the introduction of a new indemnity or insurance scheme in any industry sector will necessarily see increasing numbers of claims in the new Scheme over a period of time as the claims being to 'wash through' the system.  This is particularly relevant in relation to the numbers of maternity-related claims involving infants, including cerebral palsy cases, where often there is a timeline of several years from the date of the incident to the date of claim and ultimate settlement.</p></reply>

This is largely due to the limited number of consultant Neurologists in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Neurology (NCPN) Model of Care document recommends an increase in the number of consultant neurologists, nurse specialists, including clinical nurse specialists in Parkinson's disease, and other Health Care professionals which would address waiting time issues.  The programme also proposed implementation of these recommendations over a period of 5 years.  This will significantly improve the access for all Neurology patients including people with Parkinson's disease.  </p>  <p>  The model of care for neurology was launched by the Director General of the HSE on the 27th September 2016 and the HSE is now working towards its implementation.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  </p><p>In general, it is accepted clinical practice in Ireland, the UK, Europe and North America that laboratory confirmation is unnecessary for a confidently-made, clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans (the initial primary skin lesion of Lyme borreliosis).  However, this only affects about &frac34; of patients.  For later presentation Lyme borreliosis, the two-tier system is necessary to ensure that false-positive diagnosis (i.e. the test incorrectly indicates a patient has Lyme disease when, in fact, they do not have the disease) are kept to a minimum.  Serological testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi is the mainstay of diagnostic testing.</p><p>There have been significant improvements in antibody testing in recent years, making diagnosis more certain than in the past.  Testing for Lyme borreliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage process and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA &ndash; a test to detect proteins found in the Borrelia bacterium) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions (i.e. leading to over diagnosis) in the presence of other infections such as syphilis, and certain, common viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, false-positive results can also occur in patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions including, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, diabetes or ulcerative colitis.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in Initial screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage, confirmatory immunoblot (such as Western blot) test.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity (i.e. it reduces the likelihood of these false positive results).  Using this two stage approach gives a considerably greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland, must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the laboratory tests they provide is maintained at conform to the highest internationally-accepted standards of microbiological excellence.  </p><p>As testing for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access this service.  This question refers to a facility in Germany and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual health facilities in another EU Member State.  </p></reply>

Unfortunately it was not possible to provide funding for this application as the applications for lottery funding last year far exceeded the funds that were available to my Department.  </p><p>393 applications for National Lottery funding were received in 2016 of which 136 were approved for a grant.  A list of all applicants approved for a National Lottery grant was published on my Department's website last November and each successful applicant was notified of their approval for a grant in early December 2016.  </p><p>The 257 unsuccessful applicants were informed of the outcome by email between December 2016 and January 2017.  In the case of the application in question, a grant approval notification was inadvertently generated and issued to the applicant in January 2017.  This notification did not specify any grant amount.  As soon as the error was detected my Department contacted the applicant, explained that a grant had not in fact been approved, that the notification she received had been generated and issued in error, and apologised for the confusion and any inconvenience caused.  The correct notification was subsequently issued to the applicant advising that all the 2016 lottery funding had been disbursed and that it was not possible to provide funding for the project.</p><p>I regret that I was not in a position to provide the requested funding on this occasion and that an incorrect notification was initially issued to the applicant; however, I am pleased to note that the HSE was in a position to provide grants of &euro;1.149m to Camphill Communities of Ireland during 2016.  </p><p>My Department no longer operates a National Lottery Fund.  However, the HSE operates a similar scheme and continues to provide grants to health agencies and other organisations from National Lottery funds.

It is also important to ensure that prescribing policies are evidence based thereby ensuring safe use of these medicines.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that all medicines have side effects.  However before being made available to the public a medicine undergoes an authorisation process where the medicine&rsquo;s safety, quality and efficacy is assessed, based on the results of clinical trials.  It is only when the risk benefit analysis is positive, i.e. that the potential benefits to the patient outweigh the potential risks that the medicine receives an authorisation.  </p>  <p>  Once available a medicine is then subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation through a process of pharmacocovigilance which operates at EU wide level to monitor the use of the medicines in large numbers of patients and manage and analyse information on suspected adverse reactions to medicines.  </p>  <p>  European reviews of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants and opioids have resulted in updates to product information in order to support better informed prescribing and use of these medicines in various patient groups including children.  Important safety updates are communicated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to healthcare professionals via their Drug Safety Newsletter.  The HPRA, in conjunction with its European counterparts continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and take appropriate regulatory action when necessary.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland there are a number of sources of prescribing guidelines.  More recent guidelines include a Consensus Statement issued by the College of Psychiatry on the use of benzodiazepines in specialist mental health services (2012), Guidance issued by the Irish College of General Practitioners on Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Diagnosis and Management (2013), and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016.  Section 42 of the Medical Council Guide states for example that doctors should keep up to date with developments in medication safety and seek independent, evidence-based sources of information on the benefits and risk of the medicine.  It also states that doctors should be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential and should take reasonable steps to make sure they are not inappropriately obtaining drugs from multiple sources. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has also been actively involved in ensuring appropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs.  Reports are sent to GPs on a regular basis setting out the number of benzodiazepine and &lsquo;z&rsquo; drug prescriptions dispensed to their patients and these reports allow GPs to compare their prescribing patterns to their peers.  The reports also highlight where patients are on these medications for longer than the recommended period.  The HSE Medicines Management Programme has also written to hospital consultants recommending that where a patient is not being treated with benzodiazepines or z drugs on entering hospital that the discharge summary should not contain such medication. </p>  <p>   The Misuse of Drugs legislation imposes tight controls on all controlled drugs.  A number of changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations are due to be implemented shortly.  One of the most significant effects of the new Regulation in relation to benzodiazepines and z drugs is that the restrictions in place on the possession of controlled drugs will now apply to these medicines.  A form of controlled drug prescription will now be required for these medicines. </p></reply>

Section 77 of the 2011 Act allows the Board to remove a person's name from the register for non-payment of the annual retention fee (ARF). In that regard, this Section indicates that the Board may, not earlier than 28 days after the reminder has been sent, remove the nurse&rsquo;s or midwife&rsquo;s registration.</p>  <p>  The NMBI have advised that a renewal notice and a reminder notice were issued to registrants on 6 November 2016 and 15 February 2017 respectively.  Consideration of removal of names from the register is not considered by the Board until at least 28 days has elapsed from the date of the reminder notice. In addition, a final reminder was sent to registrants on 8 March 2017.  The Board decided on 21 March 2017 that 2,258 people who had not paid their ARF would be removed from the register.  The NMBI have advised that the final reminder which issued on 8th March 2017 indicated that the Board would consider removals from the register at its meeting on 21 March.  Registrants were informed that the fee must be paid with immediate effect to avoid removal. </p>  <p>The Board has also confirmed that anyone who has been removed from the register must complete the restoration form and pay the restoration fee of &euro;250.  However, it should be noted that a person removed from the Register for non-payment of the ARF may apply to have the restoration fee waived. In that regard, the outcome of the following is considered:</p>  <p>  - Review of the application and the personal circumstances of the individual at the time of the removal.</p>  <p>  - Assessment, on an individual basis, as to whether the personal circumstances of the registrant, at the time of their removal from the Register, were of a serious and extenuating nature or whether there are humanitarian grounds upon which a decision to waive the restoration fee may be made.</p>  <p>  Following assessment, the Director of Registry may decide to waive the restoration fee.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway. An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively, and it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  This review is currently underway. </p></reply>

Since that time the post of NTPF CEO was filled on an acting part-time basis.  Between 2013 and 2017 Mr Jim O' Sullivan held the post of acting CEO of the NTPF on a part-time basis.  No conflict of interest arose in respect of Mr. O' Sullivan's appointment as his role as CEO of the NTPF was clearly defined and distinct from his work within the HSE as Programme Director.</p>  <p>  Last October, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In line with commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reduce waiting times for our longest waiting patients, the NTPF resumed patient treatment commissioning in 2017.  As a result of this change in scope of the NTPF's role, the Board of the NTPF decided it would be necessary for the organisation to appoint a full time CEO.</p>  <p>  An open recruitment process was carried out by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).  Chairman of the Board of the NTPF has advised that Mr. Liam Sloyan will take up the position of CEO in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In relation to waiting list audits, this one of the key objectives for the NTPF.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and /or swelling at the point of injection and fever.  These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.  Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. </p>  <p>  The EMA completed a detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS and POTS are caused by HPV vaccines.  It therefore did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines. On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all members states.</p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  	As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. </p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway. An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively; in that regard, it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation, therefore where such changes are needed they will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.

The overall claims experience is influenced by a number of factors such as the cost of claims, the cost of care, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations. Each of these are contributors to the cost of premiums payable. </p>  <p>  A community-rated health insurance market depends on inter-generational solidarity and requires a constant influx of young healthy members to support the older, less healthy members. In 2015 two policy measures were introduced to ensure the ongoing viability of community rating - Lifetime Community Rating and Young Adult rates. Lifetime Community Rating was designed to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age and to retain it. Young Adult rates are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26. This approach ensures the phasing-in of full adult rates and eases the effect of the dramatic price increases when student rates no longer apply. Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.</p>  <p>  The positive impact of these initiatives on the market is now evident, as the number of people holding private health insurance has increased to 2.152 million, or 46% of the population (end-December 2016). Critically, these figures include a total of 240,025 insured lives in the age cohort 25-35 years (an increase of 13,785 compared to end-December 2015), which contributes positively to keeping health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.</p>  <p>  A review of the Lifetime Community Rating Regulations, after 30 April 2017, is provided for in the legislation.  The independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), has already completed its public consultation process as a first phase of its review.  Members of the public were invited to submit their views before the deadline of 3 March 2017. The HIA are now in the process of considering all of the submissions received and will submit its report and recommendations to me in due course.</p></reply>

Venesection for the treatment of Haemochromatosis is not considered a routine service under the GMS contract. Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS or GP Visit Card contracts are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients. While I have no role in relation to such fees,  I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the ongoing review of the GMS and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs, and that the next phase of discussions to progress this work is underway.  The aim is to develop a new modern GP services contract which will incorporate a range of standard and enhanced services to be delivered.

It envisages the transfer of significant statutory powers from the existing Charter to the new company.  As such, the new company will have clinical and operational independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services, as well as financial and budgetary independence.  It is intended that the Trust, or a successor thereof, would retain certain activities, including those relating to nominations to the new company, fund raising and teaching and research etc.</p>  <p>  The agreement secured protects the identity and branding of the NMH and the right to use of the new maternity hospital facility.  The autonomy of the NMH Board will be underpinned by reserved powers to ensure clinical and operational independence, and the Minister for Health will hold the power to protect those reserved powers.  The financial interests of the State will be protected through a requirement for a lien to be placed on the hospital.</p></reply>

This commitment has been fulfilled and the review was completed by Dr Niall Herity, a highly respected Belfast-based NHS cardiologist.  I consider that Dr Herity's approach to the analysis and interpretation of the available evidence was independent, thorough and scientifically robust and took account of best international practice and guidance.  Accordingly, I have accepted Dr Herity's findings and recommendations in their entirety.</p>  <p>  To facilitate the implementation of those recommendations, I have provided additional funding of &euro;0.5m for UHW in 2017 which will enable the hospital to provide 8 hours additional cath lab activity each week.  However, in relation to the cessation of PPCI services at the hospital, as Minister for Health, I want to be sure that any service changes which we implement, will result in improved services for patients using that service.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all PPCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  In the meantime, patients in the South East will continue to have access to out of hours PPCI services at Cork University Hospital or St James's Hospital, Dublin.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities. This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is well advanced.</p><p>In relation to the cost of care in public residential facilities, Section 33(2) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for the HSE to charge for the cost of care in long-term residential care settings.  The components that make up the cost of care are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector, including a higher nurse staffing ratio and the impact of public service rates of pay and conditions of employment.</p><p>The geographical spread of residential placements is also a factor. In some rural areas long stay beds are provided for geographical reasons in smaller centres which would not be profitable for a private provider to supply, e.g. Achill Island and Donegal.</p><p>With that said, it is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and deliver the best possible value for money.  Towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities. Differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will also be the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review which will be commenced by the Department of Health in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.</p></reply>

It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2017 is &euro;940m and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will support 23,603 clients by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Public Nursing Units are an essential part of our national nursing home infrastructure.  They provide 5,000 long stay residential care beds i.e. approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds.  They also provide about 2,000 short stay beds.  Many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context, but notwithstanding this, the standard of care delivered to residents is generally of a very high standard.  It is important therefore that we consolidate our existing stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities which will consolidate our existing public stock and is expected to provide 250 additional beds.</p>  <p>  With regard to private facilities, in Budget 2016 the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme to allow for investment in the expansion, management and operation of nursing homes. The inclusion of nursing home expansion works in the Scheme was influenced by an analysis submitted by the Department of Health on measures, including tax measures, to support targeted development in nursing homes and primary care centres.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that it is Government policy that long-term nursing home care should be a last resort and we want to develop home and community care services to provide a more viable alternative to nursing home care for a greater number of people. In that context,  I am prioritising the development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services.</p></reply>

It aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  Similarly, it recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model of care that encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  The model consists of three care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised.  The Strategy also proposes the development of Alongside Birth Centres across each Maternity Network.</p><p>The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the newly established National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  The Programme is drawing up a detailed action plan to inform this process, which will include plans to roll out the new care pathways and birth centres.  This work will also include the identification of both capital and revenue funding requirements, which will in turn inform the annual Estimates process over the lifetime of the Strategy.  The Strategy states that intrapartum guidelines will be developed through the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) process.  To that end, Professor Michael Turner is the Chair of the guideline development group and work has commenced.</p></reply>

They have since been produced on a monthly basis, being published on the basis of a two month time lag. The Statement currently consists of 17 metrics, including, as the Deputy notes, figures for rates of induction and also for Caesarean sections. The introduction of Maternity Patient Statements was among the recommendations made by the Chief Medical Officer of my Department in his Report on Perinatal Deaths at Portlaoise Hospital, which was published in February 2014. The information contained in the Statements provides hospitals and Hospital Groups with a snapshot of key information which can serve to provide an immediate indication of whether there is any cause for concern in relation to the safety and quality of the maternity services being delivered.</p>  <p>  The HSE has established a governance mechanism to provide oversight of the process, including the metrics in use. However, I understand that the HSE does not intend to alter the metrics at this time, primarily as it is desired to establish a consistent series of data in order to establish trends across the health service.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include:</p>  <p>  - Examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme,</p>  <p>  - The implementation of administrative reforms to the Scheme,</p>  <p>  - A review by the NTPF of present pricing arrangements in private residential facilities.</p>  <p>  This work is currently under way.  A Value For Money and Policy Review of the differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will commence in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.  </p>  <p>  An initial report on the progress of the NHSS Review recommendations was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.</p>  <p>  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively, and it is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation.</p></reply>

This has included the allocation of increased funding in recent years.  Additional staff have been recruited to foster a strong culture of organ donation, to optimise conversion rates and to ultimately increase the number of transplants that are carried out.  Last year saw the second highest annual number of organ transplants carried out in Ireland, with a record 50 living donor kidney transplants.</p>  <p>  My Department is supportive of the Irish Kidney Association (IKA), and the work they do to raise awareness of organ donation, including through the Organ Donor Card initiative.  Funding of &euro;180,000 was provided to IKA in 2016 by the Health Service Executive and further funding is being made available this year.  Much of the emphasis in relation to awareness is on encouraging people to discuss organ donation with their loved ones to ensure that we can avail of opportunities for organ donation when they arise.  </p>  <p>  Work on scoping the parameters of legislation for a Human Tissue Bill is currently being undertaken in my Department.  It is envisaged that this Bill will provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation.  Under the proposed system, consent will be deemed unless the person has, while alive, registered his/her wish not to become an organ donor after death.  However, it is proposed that, even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will always be consulted prior to removing any organ ("soft" opt-out system).  The aim is to make organ donation the norm in situations where the opportunity arises.</p></reply>

These are set out in Section 8 of the Health Act 2007, and include the setting of standards on safety and quality for services provided by or on behalf of the HSE, for nursing homes, for disability centers and to monitor compliance with those standards.  HIQA is also empowered, under section 9 of the Act, to undertake investigations into services on a number of grounds, including where it believes that there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving the services, or where it is directed to do so by the Minister. </p><p>It is also worth noting that HIQA undertakes a number of other significant tasks, including evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of new medical technologies, and improving the quality of the health information which is available to the health service.</p><p>In carrying out its duties, and in particular the sensitive work of conducting inspections and investigations, HIQA has demonstrated its independence on numerous occasions.  However, in common with all State Agencies, HIQA is subject to appropriate oversight arrangements, for example in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Agencies</i>. It is also entirely appropriate that all State Agencies, including those exercising vital regulatory functions such as HIQA, should be cognisant of Government objectives in order to ensure that work programmes are appropriately tailored to the overall direction of travel of Government policy.</p><p>I would also note that HIQA has no reporting, accountability or other similar relationship with the HSE. </p></reply>

The Department of Health activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza.  The plan was accompanied by guidance that had been developed by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group (PIEG) which was updated regularly during the pandemic.  On Thursday, 11 June, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza alert phase to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic. </p>  <p>  Ireland moved from the containment to the mitigation phase on 16 July 2009.  The aim of the mitigation strategy was to limit the impact of the virus in the population.  This was achieved by a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures. Non-pharmaceutical measures included emphasising via media campaigns the importance of personal measures to limit spread, such as isolation if sick, covering mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing and hygiene measures such as washing hands. </p>  <p>  Pharmaceutical measures included treating those at risk of more severe disease with antivirals and vaccinating when the vaccine became available.  The HSE had contracts in place for the provision of pandemic vaccine with Baxter for 4.25 million doses and GSK for 3.45 million doses. Approximately 3 million doses of Pandemic vaccine were delivered to Ireland &ndash; 600,000 Baxter and 2.4 million GSK. </p>  <p>  Based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were defined and prioritised for vaccination commencing in October 2009.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded, giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  The vaccine uptakes among the priority groups were 50% for those medically at risk, 32% for pregnant women (was 45% during early part of programme), 31% for health care workers, 60% for children aged 6 months to 4 years, 39% for children aged 5-14 years and 25% for those aged 65 years and older.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  However, following a full assessment of the situation at that time the vaccine continued to be made available free of charge to the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups through General Practice and Maternity Units until September 2010.</p>  <p>  The first reports concerning a possible link between pandemic influenza vaccination and narcolepsy came to international notice in the second half of 2010.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine, used during the H1N1 2009 pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  The Irish Medicines Board (now the HPRA) received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines by the end of March 2011.</p></reply>

All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  NIAC makes many recommendations in relation to &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October 2016, including those in "at risk groups", will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p></reply>

In general, everyone, with certain exceptions, can buy the same policy at the same price. There are 2.152 million people holding private health insurance in Ireland, or 46% of the population (end-December 2016), which represents an increase of over 30,000 members in 2016.</p>  <p>  Section 7(5)(b)(iii) of the Health Insurance Act 1994 provides for a discretionary discount of up to 10%, which an insurer may give to a group of persons on private health insurance contracts.  The group discount offered can vary from group to group or plan to plan and also vary over time.  On certain plans, insurers routinely offer discounts of 10% of the net premium to all purchasers of a plan. On other plans, insurers selectively offer discounts to employees of certain employer sponsored schemes and the discount may vary depending on the employer. </p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Authority monitors the health insurance market and collects relevant information such as the number of people holding health insurance, age breakdown of the insured population, number of plans on the market and other market statistics. As the Authority does not collect information regarding the number of persons covered by policies with a 10% group discount, I am unable to supply information in this regard.</p></reply>

It is a relatively new form of treatment with narrow indications for use and therefore the evidence base is limited.  Decisions relating to appropriate treatment, including radiotherapy, for individual patients with cancer are a matter for clinicians (cancer specialists) in consultation with patients and their families.  The very small number of Irish patients (22 in 2015), who are clinically assessed as benefitting from proton beam therapy, avail of the treatment overseas under the HSE&rsquo;s Treatment Abroad Scheme. Further international research in larger populations is required before the clinical indications for the use of proton beam therapy could be extended.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  In excess of 2000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment has commenced.  The focus of this initiative will be those lists with large numbers of long waiting patients including Ophthalmology.</p>  <p>  In addition to this Daycase Initiative, the NTPF has been working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation.  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plans for Inpatient/Daycase procedures and Outpatient appointments to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 15 months by the end of October. The Inpatient/Day case Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's approach to the utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017. </p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.  My Department is currently engaging with the HSE and the NTPF to finalise these plans which I expect to approve shortly.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently finalising the Report of the Primary Care Eye Services Review. The overall aim of the Review is to reorganise primary care eye  services with an increased emphasis on maximising delivery of a comprehensive service at primary care level and thereby creating capacity in the acute sector to provide more complex services.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years, with interest only facilities of up to three years.  The Scheme was administered by SBCI through the participating banks; AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. Normal lending assessment criteria apply and the terms and conditions of each individual loan is agreed between the banks and the applicants according to their individual circumstances.  The Department has no operational role in the Scheme nor can it deal with individual applications.  Those who may be dissatisfied with a decision may seek a review of an application to the Scheme from the Credit Review Office, which provides an independent, impartial appeals process on credit decisions for small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), including sole traders and farmers.</p>  <p>  I am meeting with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss the Scheme and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.</p></reply>

Over 70% of all timber products manufactured here in Ireland are exported to the UK.  Brexit will most likely result in increased costs for exporters through border delays, tariffs and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as increased competition from third country imports and reduced demand from the UK market.</p>  <p>  However, the wood processing sector in Ireland has some important advantages that will stand to it as it prepares to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  The main players in the industry are relatively small in number and are agile, as was shown during the economic crash when they were able to change their focus to export markets.  The sector has also invested heavily in sawmilling technology.</p>  <p>  As well as expanding their export markets and cutting costs, saw mills can prepare for BREXIT through continued investment in the supply chain and manufacturing technologies, and through moving up the value chain.  A Renewable Heat Incentive scheme is scheduled for launch later this year, which will create additional domestic markets for forest-based biomass for energy purposes.  This will have the impact of bringing forward additional supplies of sawlog material in subsequent thinnings, particularly from privately owned forests.</p>  <p>  My Department is undertaking a review of both our forest policy document entitled &ldquo;Forest, Products and People&rdquo; and the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020 so that forest policy and implementing measures properly reflect the needs of the sector as we face into BREXIT negotiations and beyond.  The sector took an active part in the All-island Sectoral Dialogue in which the issues around BREXIT for the sector were teased out.  My Department will continue to work constructively with the industry on this matter so that potential risks can be mitigated and any opportunities can be identified and pursued.</p></reply>

In order to maximise the number of young farmers for eligibility under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers schemes, it was decided that any person who met the other qualifying requirements and commenced a relevant agricultural course anytime up to and including September 2016 would be accepted under the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme in 2015.  The increased flexibility would ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; categories would be widely available even to those who were unable to complete their agricultural course by 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational eligibility criteria being applied to the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme, and the increased flexibility in relation to same.  The EU Commission subsequently advised Ireland that the flexible arrangements that would allow an applicant to commence their agricultural education after the date of submission of an application under the National Reserve and/or Young Farmers Scheme did not fit with the &lsquo;annual logic of the Direct Payments&rsquo; and was a risk of non-compliance with requirements.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that no young farmer would be disadvantaged by this ruling and in order to comply with the notification from the EU Commission thus avoiding the risk of a financial correction for Ireland, extensive efforts were put in place by the Department and Teagasc at the end of 2015.  This resulted in applicants to the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme being provided with a placement on an agricultural education course prior to 31 December 2015.</p>  <p>  A copy of the correspondence referred to will be made available directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore I was pleased to announce the launch of the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; on 31st January.  The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.</p>  <p>  The loans are available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers and others involved in primary agricultural production.  My Department is contributing &euro;25million in total, which includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo; and &euro;14 million in national funding. SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.</p>  <p>  The banks will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.</p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  I am meeting with the Chief Executives of the banks shortly to discuss this and other issues relating to access to finance in the agri-food sector.</p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.</p>  <p>  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, it is currently envisaged that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS. Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible. </p>  <p>  With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements every 2 years.  Therefore if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after 2 years unless he (a) got more land (b) leased out his entitlements or (c) sold the entitlements.</p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned/leased, used and managed by the applicant. If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted.  Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable.  </p>  <p>  With regard to taxation it is primarily an issue for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  An inter-departmental committee, including representation from my Department, is currently considering the taxation implications of the installation of solar panels on farmland, with a view to achieving clarification on various issues from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners later this year.</p></reply>

A draft report of the Ex ante assessment examining all 7 required steps was completed and sent to the Steering Committee on 15 December 2016.  A presentation on the draft report of the ex-ante assessment was also given to the Steering Committee on 22 December 2016.  Following this presentation, written comments and suggestions from the Steering Committee members were sent to the evaluator and a revised report was submitted on the 3 March 2017.  The Steering Committee have requested further clarification on a number of issues addressed in the revised report and are awaiting a response from the Evaluator.</p><p>Once an ex-ante assessment is complete a decision can be made on whether or not to implement a FI and the possible budgetary implications.  If a decision is made to proceed with FIs then an agreement must be reached between the Department and any other potential stakeholders/financial institutions on a clear investment strategy that is developed from the gaps, if any, identified in the ex-ante assessment.  Following this, an appropriate amendment would have to be made to the Rural Development Programme.  The summary findings and conclusions of the Ex ante assessment must be published within 3 months of their date of finalisation and the final report will be submitted to the RDP Monitoring Committee for information.</p><p>To date Estonia is the only EU Member state that have implemented a Financial Instrument for the current RDP period.

This is the first time such action had been taken by this Department, and was based on the increasing threat of introduction of avian influenza, following the confirmation of cases in wild birds in Great Britain (in particular in Wales). </p><p>On 8 March the decision was taken that the Regulations would remain in place until 30 April.  This announcement was made in order to give the poultry industry some certainty on the issue, to allow companies to plan for adjustments necessary to comply with marketing requirements.</p><p>The decision to maintain the period of confinement to 30 April was made after taking account of:</p><p>- the epidemiological situation in Ireland - 12 cases of the H5N8 strain of avian influenza were confirmed in 4 different wild bird species in 10 locations in 6 counties over the period 30 December 2016 to 24 February 2017</p><p>- advice from ornithologists with regard to migratory patterns of the affected wild bird species,</p><p>- the ability of the virus to survive in the environment.</p><p>One of the objectives is to protect poultry flocks from the introduction of avian influenza, and thus maintain the OIE Avian Influenza free status of Ireland.  This will ensure Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to third country markets for poultry and poultry products. </p><p>The decision reflects a careful assessment and evaluation of the information and data specific to Ireland and is in the best interests of the poultry industry in Ireland. </p><p>In relation to confining birds during high-risk periods, it is up to the Competent Authority in each Member State to assess the risks in their country.  It is not a decision made on a European-wide basis.</p><p>My Department has not been made aware of any significant reported decrease in egg sales as a result of the current Avian Influenza restrictions, but is monitoring the situation and will consider all options available.  It should be noted that Bord Bia has also made itself available to the sector to engage in promotional activities at this time.</p></reply>

Exceptionally dry weather last October allowed silage to be made in many areas which helped ease the difficulties caused by the earlier wet weather in the west and northwest.  The long term Met Eireann weather forecast is good which will allow land to dry further and facilitate the turnout of stock.  Nationally, there is sufficient fodder for sale to ensure no shortages in the short term.  Taking account of this, there are no plans at this time to establish a fodder aid scheme.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, I am pleased to record that to date &euro;1.183billion has been paid out under the 2016/17 Basic Payment Scheme to 123,929 farmers and these payments are ongoing.  Furthermore, payments of &euro;201.38 million have also been made to 94,101 applicants under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.   </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rsquo;  was introduced to enable farmers to plan and budget more effectively by providing an attractive cash flow support loan product as an alternative to more expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and bank overdraft facilities.  The purposes for which the loans may be used include working capital requirements, and the interest rate that applies is 2.95%.  There has been significant interest in the scheme; however there may be some residual availability and this will be apparent as applications are processed and loans drawn down.  Further details can be sourced on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>   My Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

In that regard, I decided that I am restricting consideration to the increased quota for Ireland in 2017 over that in 2016. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that I have not made any decision at this time to change the allocations between the segments in respect of this part of the quota.

In order to maximise the number of young farmers for eligibility under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers schemes, it was decided that any person who meets the other qualifying requirements and commenced a relevant agricultural course anytime up to and including September 2016 would be accepted under the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme in 2015.  The increased flexibility would ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; categories would be widely available even to those who were unable to complete their agricultural course by 2015. </p>  <p>  Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational eligibility criteria being applied to the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme, and the increased flexibility in relation to same.  The EU Commission subsequently advised Ireland that the flexible arrangements that would allow an applicant to commence their agricultural education after the date of submission of an application under the National Reserve and/or Young Farmers Scheme did not fit with the &lsquo;annual logic of the Direct Payments&rsquo; and was a risk of non-compliance with requirements. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that no young farmer would be disadvantaged by this ruling and in order to comply with the notification from the EU Commission thus avoiding the risk of a financial correction for Ireland, extensive efforts were put in place by the Department and Teagasc at the end of 2015.  This resulted in applicants to the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme being provided with a placement on an agricultural education course prior to 31st December 2015.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p>  <p>  On 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to their plans to provide broadband to  an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir has committed to doing this work over the next 90 weeks, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that they meet their obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  I  also formally published an updated High Speed Broadband Map on  4 April which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The updated Map shows the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:  </p>  <p>  -  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,</p>  <p>  -  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p>  <p>  It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  The map shows that 92% of the townland of Ballynakill (Ikeathy and Oughterany By) Co Meath falls within a BLUE area and will be covered in line with commitment agreement with eir while the remaining 8% is within the AMBER area and will be require State Intervention.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  With the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map the State Intervention Area has now been finalised.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP once contracts are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. </p>  <p>  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand and a prioritisation programme.</p></reply>

Analysis is on-going on the types of technologies to be included such as biomass, offshore and onshore wind, waste, and combined heat and power.  This analysis also includes an assessment of the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground-mounted.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland.  This builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper and recognises that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.</p>  <p>  The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies at various scales.  Once this analysis is complete, my Department will publish a public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.  There will be many decisions to be made on this scheme with regard to scale, technologies and &ndash; in particular &ndash; how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes.  Following the outcome of this public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in the first half of 2018.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar PV sector in Ireland.  I am advised that there have been over 550 applications, amounting to about 3,900 Megawatts of solar capacity, seeking a connection to the electricity grid in the last 18 months.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid, my stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.

These regulations are implemented and enforced in the EU via Regulation (EC) No 216 of 2008, within the framework of the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).  In addition, the EU Aviation Emissions Trading Scheme (DIRECTIVE 2003/87) is implemented in Ireland by SI 490 of 2012.</p>  <p>  As regards the climate effects of aircraft emissions, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is the main EU tool for bringing about reductions in aviation greenhouse gas emissions associated with flights within its own administrative area.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation has agreed to develop a global market based measure to address international aviation, aiming to stabilise international aviation emissions at 2020 levels.  The first phase of this mechanism, which the EU and its Member States intend to apply, will operate on a voluntary inclusion basis.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitor a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.

This latest report and previous years&rsquo; reports as well as a recent public consultation document are available on their website: www.epa.ie.  Emissions from aircraft have not been identified as negatively impacting on air quality standards in Ireland in any reports from the EPA to date.</p>  <p>  Periodically some concerns are expressed about the condensation trails which can be seen from aircraft.  I am not aware of any credible information or evidence that the trails from aircraft passing over Ireland are anything other than normal condensation trails, referred to as &ldquo;contrails&rdquo;, the appearance of which is known to vary according to atmospheric conditions, and which have no observable impact on air quality or human health.</p></reply>

The report of the Task Force was published in December and is  available at the following link:.</p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.</p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.</p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in April, following the end of this quarter.</p><p>In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

I am aware that issues have now  been referred to the Labour Court and both sides will now engage with the Court as it seeks to resolve the outstanding issues.  I hope we will see an acceptable and fair deal emerge and that the disruption to people's travel arrangements will end as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I have consistently stated that I will not intervene in areas where Ministerial intervention is not appropriate and I am clear that negotiations relating to the internal organisation of a company is such an area.</p>  <p>  However, I have acted in areas where I believe it to be appropriate to do so.  I have increased the amount of funding available for socially necessary, but financially unviable PSO services and I have committed toward further increasing that funding as resources allow.  I have instructed my officials to work with the Department of Social Protection in examining the funding associated with the Free Travel Scheme and I expect a satisfactory conclusion to that examination.  I have assured rural Ireland that the NTA has the statutory powers and resources required to ensure transport connectivity is maintained where commercial bus services are altered.  I have invited members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to submit their views on the commercial bus licensing system and stated my willingness to consider amending current legislation in cases where improvements can be identified.  I have stated I am open to meeting all relevant stakeholders on issues relating to public transport.</p></reply>

Like any business, SAA is conscious of the need to control its costs so that it can remain competitive and continue to attract new airline business in an increasingly competitive international marketplace.  In this regard, one of the proposals that the company has had initial discussions with staff and union representatives about is to operate at Category 9 on a flexible basis rather than operate permanently at that level, 24/7, all year 'round.  This would contribute to a more efficient operating model at the airport without any material impact on flight operations.</p>  <p>  I understand that this arrangement will arise in any event, at nightimes, for a temporary period of about 26 weeks as a consequence of the resurfacing of the main runway at Shannon which is due to get underway on 25th April next.</p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Question to SAA for direct reply.

The initiative is designed to help overcome the  low levels of private investment in in key areas such as infrastructure, education, research and innovation, as well as risk finance for small businesses in the European Union by mobilising private financing for strategic investments.  The EU contribution of &euro;21 billion to the EFSI is expected to unlock a total investment, public and private, of &euro;315 billion through a multiplier effect.</p><p>In September 2014 the Special Task Force on Investment in the EU was established in response to a request by the EU Economic and Finance Ministers.  Its mandate included identifying potential investment projects. It was jointly led by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) and included representatives of all EU Member States.  The EU Task Force invited member states to submit proposals for potential projects. Four proposals were put forward by my Department to the Department of Finance, which collated the proposals across Government departments and submitted the national list to the EU Task Force. However, the proposals from my Department did not subsequently proceed.</p><p>In relation to assisting SMEs response to Brexit, my officials are also exploring the potential to provide further supports to SMEs and this is currently part of a deliberative process.</p><p><b>Budget 2017</b></p><p>The 2017 Budget contains many measures that will assist Irish business to become more competitive and cope with the impact of Brexit.  My Department secured an extra &euro;52 million in Capital funding, a 10% increase, to support further job creation, innovation and support Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities from Brexit.  These additional capital monies for 2017 will help to ensure that the Agencies are well positioned to deal with the challenges that Brexit will undoubtedly present to their clients.</p><p>This year<b>, </b>Enterprise Ireland will have an additional &euro;7 million (+12%) in capital funding, bringing its general business supports to clients to &euro;63 million.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit strategy is to sustain and grow exports to the UK but also to support their clients to diversify into new markets outside the UK.  A key focus is improving client capability around competitiveness, markets, marketing skills, innovation, risk management and strategic financial skills.</p><p>Local Enterprise Offices capital grants are up by &euro;4m (+22%) in 2017 to a total of &euro;22.5 million.  This is the largest ever capital allocation to the LEOs (or their predecessors CEBs). The LEOs are working with non-EI client companies, providing support &amp;amp; advice services as well as bespoke services to foster new business opportunities in local areas.</p><p>My Department also secured an additional &euro;3m in current funding for 2017 specifically to assist in our response to the evolving Brexit scenario.  This funding will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit an additional 40 to 50 staff to supplement existing staffing numbers for Brexit planning and contingency.  This funding will enable Enterprise Ireland to recruit 39 extra staff for overseas offices and the Ireland-based team to support exporting companies in the context of Brexit.  Staff will be assigned to:  </p><p>- Markets that are growing and have scale (including China, India, Latin America, Africa); </p><p>- Markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth (including UK, France, Benelux, Germany, US, Nordics).</p><p>Specifically, these 39 posts include:  </p><p>- 17 new posts in overseas offices, </p><p>- 22 Irish based posts which includes; </p><p>- 17 to support internationalisation activities, </p><p>- 10 to support competitiveness and sectoral growth,  </p><p>- 3 to strengthen the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises and</p><p>- 2 to Horizon 2020 Support Network which works with researchers and companies to maximise participation in Horizon 2020.</p><p><b>Hedging against Foreign Currency Fluctuations</b></p><p>Sterling currency fluctuations have created challenges for Irish business. My department is working with Agencies and stakeholders to develop appropriate evidence based response/intervention for firms with an exposure to the UK market which will be fully aligned with state aid rules. </p><p>Managing currency risk by means of hedging is an immediate issue for exporters to the UK.  For an exporter to hedge its currency risk, in the first instance, it must first have a foreign exchange line of credit from the bank.  This must be formally sought in advance prior to its use and, from the bank&rsquo;s perspective, it is the equivalent of making a loan application, i.e. it requires credit approval.</p><p>The advantage of this instrument is that an exporter can bring certainty to the amount of euro that it will receive in return for a specified amount of sterling at this stated future date.  The primary disadvantage is that there is no opportunity to share in an upside in currency movement.</p><p>Most banks will have a maximum time period for which they will sell forward contracts to their customers.  In general, most banks will not provide forward contracts for periods beyond 12 months.  In some cases, the banks may require security to be provided in the form of charges over assets or guarantees.</p><p>A final point to note in hedging foreign currency risk is that there are non-bank providers of such services who tend to be less prescriptive in their dealings.  However, many borrowing agreements now specify that the borrower may only conduct foreign currency transactions with the lender.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland is providing important advice to client companies regarding managing currency risks.  Many have taken this advice and hedged to late 2017.  Others are naturally hedged by having operations in both Irish and UK markets.  I would point out, however, that pragmatic and forward looking firms should be looking into the feasibility of hedging in the current situation.  While not for everyone it is something that growth oriented exporters to the UK should be examining in detail to see if it has the potential to mitigate the potential damage that might be done to their business by exchange rate fluctuations.</p><p><b>Export Finance Initiative </b></p><p>The proposed Export Finance Initiative, which is being led by the Department of Finance, will support the working capital needs of Irish exporters.  It is proposed that this Initiative will enable exporting SMEs to obtain necessary working capital that they would be unable to access without a guarantee.  This will allow exporting SMEs to secure competitive financing, safeguard their exports, and win new export orders and markets. </p><p>My Department, along with other Government Departments and agencies are working closely to ensure that the initiative is made available to SMEs as quickly as possible.  It is expected that the initiative will be rolled out by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) in the first half of this year.  The planned mechanism includes delivery through commercial finance providers. </p><p><b>APJ 2017</b></p><p>Responding to Brexit has been prioritised in Action Plan for Jobs 2017, which sets out 20 specific actions aimed at growing and diversifying markets for Irish exports and maximise opportunities in foreign direct investment and research and innovation. </p></reply>

The Agenda for the meetings is set by the Commission.</p>  <p>  Given that Brexit has created new challenges for Irish companies,   we are already working closely with the EU Commission and our EU partners to ensure that we have a shared understanding of the implications and effects of the UK's departure from the EU.</p>  <p>  My Department, working closely with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), EI and stakeholders (such as SFA, ISME, IBEC and Chambers), has conducted a structured engagement with a diverse range of companies across sectors and regions.  The purpose of this engagement is to construct an evidence base on which appropriate, tailored and targeted responses can be delivered to meet real identified business needs.  The outcome of the structured engagement and analysis of the findings, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, will inform further discussions with the Commission and the development of any further initiatives to business. </p>  <p>  In additional, my Department, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have measures in place to address the issues for companies such as diversification, cost reduction, innovation and price repositioning.

That General Scheme was published in 2007. </p>  <p>  Given the significant changes that the Companies Act 2014 as whole introduced, the Act provided for a general transitional period of 18 months from the date of its commencement.  This was to allow for companies to adapt, for example to convert to the new company forms, if necessary, and to change the company name as a result. Once the transitional period ended, companies must comply fully with the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. </p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 was commenced on 1 June 2015 and the general transitional period ended on 30 November 2016.  Most companies were able to make any necessary adaptations within that 18 month period. </p>  <p>  As the Companies Act 2014 was being enacted (it was the Companies Bill 2012), representations were made by some companies, including in the pharmaceutical industry, and by their legal representatives.  They stated that the 18 month transitional period would not be sufficient time for the necessary organisational changes due to the nature of their businesses.  They asked for an extension of time beyond the 18 month period.</p>  <p>  In response, the Oireachtas gave the Minister a power in section 1237(5) to consider applications from unlimited companies for longer adaptation periods where special circumstances exist.  This was enacted as section 1237(5) and was intended as a temporary measure to facilitate those unlimited companies that found that they needed more than the general transition period of 18 months. </p>  <p>  During the general transition period some unlimited companies did assess that they would need longer, and applied for an extension under section 1237(5).  Extensions were granted to just over 100 companies, some within the same groups as each other, for a period of 5 years in addition to the 18 months of the general transitional period.  A few of these companies are in the pharmaceutical sector.  These extensions are due to end on 1 December 2021. </p>  <p>  Now that the general transition period is over, unlimited companies are legally obliged to comply with the requirements of section 1237(1) unless they have been granted an extension of additional time.  </p>  <p>  Section 3(1)(j) of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 deletes section 1237(5) of the Companies Act 2014 because the need for section 1237(5) no longer exists.  Maintaining section 1237(5) on the Statute Book could give rise to confusion.  Companies that are forming for the first time have made applications to me under section 1237(5). This is clearly contrary to the policy of section 1237(1). </p>  <p>  One of the main principles underpinning the Companies Act 2014 is the principle of transparency.  Also, the Act provides for 5 main company types and the rules for each type are different in some respects.  For example, unlimited companies are not obliged to file financial statements with their Annual Return in the Companies Registration Office.  It is important that third parties know what type of company they are dealing with.  The obligation to include the company type in the company&rsquo;s name has applied to the vast majority of companies registered in Ireland for several years. </p>  <p>  As the original intention of section 1237(5) was to create a temporary measure, it was not necessary to consult on its removal.  All extensions that have been granted are unaffected and remain in place until they expire in late 2021.</p></reply>

It is therefore not in the country&rsquo;s interests to set out, in detail, the specific engagement that has been undertaken with targeted new investors.  In fact, to do so would risk both compromising the progress that has been made with prospective new clients of the Agency and losing the potential jobs that might accompany any such new future investment here. </p></reply>

These supports all help companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland works with researchers across the HEI sector to assist in maximising the commercial return from publicly-funded research.  The Enterprise Ireland Commercialisation Fund provides supports for academic researchers to take research outputs with commercial potential and bring them to a point where they can either be transferred into industry or spun out into a new start-up company.  In this way, the Commercialisation Fund helps to ensure that there is an avenue for ongoing research to be translated into industry relevant outputs which can drive company creation and growth.  The programme funds the development of innovations at all stages of the commercial pipeline to the point where they can be commercialised as new products, services and companies. </p><p>The Commercialisation Fund, combined with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Technology Transfer Supports, facilitates the creation of 25 to 30 new spinout companies per annum (26 for 2016), approximately 15 of which become High Potential Start-Ups each year.  They also generate more than 160 new commercially relevant technologies per annum (186 in 2016) that can be transferred to industry where they can achieve economic impact for companies. </p><p>1,518 Commercialisation Fund projects were approved in the period 2006-2016 of which 823 were Feasibility/Proof of Concept projects.  These are feasibility grants to investigate, scope and develop a commercial case for an innovation in advance of submitting a full Commercialisation Fund support application to the programme.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland approvals and payments under the Commercialisation Fund in the period 2006 -2016 is presented in tabular format below.</p><p>Commercialisation Fund Approvals (&euro;m):<table><tr><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>28.79</td><td>27.28</td><td>21.54</td><td>12.55</td><td>7.71</td><td>15.87</td><td>23.71</td><td>17.05</td><td>19.41</td><td>15.59</td><td>13.62</td></tr></table></p><p>Commercialisation Fund Payments (&euro;m):<table><tr><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>18.78</td><td>21.91</td><td>25.34</td><td>23.24</td><td>17.47</td><td>14.65</td><td>16.43</td><td>15.73</td><td>17.79</td><td>15.87</td><td>14.11</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, participating in larger scale collaborative research projects can be both a risky and a costly process.  By providing financial support, Enterprise Ireland can help to reduce both the cost and the risk associated with larger collaborative research projects.  Innovation Partnerships offer financial support to companies who engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology with Enterprise Ireland providing grants of up to 80% towards eligible costs of the research project with a view to developing new products, services and cost efficiencies.  </p><p>A 2014 independent evaluation of the Innovation Partnership Programme carried our for Enterprise Ireland reported that for every &euro;1 invested in this scheme company turnover increased by over &euro;6.69.  In addition, for every &euro;1 invested, the evaluation found that &euro;0.50 in investment from industry was leveraged, enabling the programme to be 50% bigger than it would have been if entirely funded by Enterprise Ireland.  The evaluation also found that 95% of companies supported through the Innovation Partnership Programme would recommend the Programme to other businesses.</p><p>There have been 569 Innovation Partnership projects approved in the period 2006-2016.

The matter has been discussed at the Early Years Forum which I chair, and in other fora with my Department.</p>  <p>  We are working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop a new Early Years workforce plan.  This will examine workforce supply issues.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that pay and conditions of staff is a significant barrier to retaining staff in the sector.  While my Department is not an employer of childcare workers, we are a significant funder.  I am committed to the development of high quality services in this country and it has been proven that high quality care is dependent on a workforce that feels valued.  My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.  The Programme for Government contains 14 commitments to improving access to high quality, affordable childcare.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which is currently under development, will provide an important infrastructure for future investment in the Early Years sector.</p>  <p>  It is clear that we need to focus collaboratively on how best to make the early years sector a more attractive and personally rewarding place in which to work.  I think that pay is only one issue, although, clearly an important one.  The fact that we are investing considerably increased resources in the sector will also be important.  In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, up by &euro;120m to &euro;466m.  This was on top of a 35% increase in Budget 2016 also.</p>  <p>  These increases reflect the emphasis I am placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  In this regard, the City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committees are assisting services who experience difficulties in recruiting or retaining staff, and the Learner Funds are in place to support staff in achieving minimum qualification requirements, both regulatory and contractual.</p>  <p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting.  I believe that by working together we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children.</p></reply>

This can be as a result of abuse and/or neglect and their parents' inability to care for them due to a combination of difficulties in their own lives.  At the end of January 2017, there were 6,323 children in care of whom over 92% (5,844) were in foster care, either with relatives or with general foster carers.  There are 2 weekly rates of Foster Care Allowance - &euro;325 for children aged 0 - 12 years and &euro;352 for children aged 12 years and over which is paid to the foster family.  Foster care allowances are provided in order to allow foster carers meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs, e.g. food, clothing, school uniform, school books, extra-curricular activities, school trips, pocket money (depending on the age of the child), and treats such as toys, games or holidays.  </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that Departmental policy which Tusla operates is in accordance with the National Standards for Foster Care.  The Standards recommend that no more than two unrelated children be placed in any one foster family in recognition of the challenges involved in meeting their needs.  Exceptions are made for sibling groups, where approval will be sought from the Principal Social Worker prior to placement and notification sent to the Foster Care Committee.  </p>  <p>  Prospective general foster care applicants undergo a comprehensive and rigorous assessment before they are formally approved by a Foster Care Committee and any child is placed with them.  Relative foster carers may, in accordance with Regulations, have a child placed with them in an emergency, following initial checks, but before a full assessment and appraisal is carried out.  Foster carers are selected on the basis of their ability to meet the needs of the individual child.  Social work support is also provided for foster carers in the form of a link worker.  The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  </p>  <p>  The use of private foster placements, in approximately 6% of total foster placements, is a necessary part of ensuring that the service is available at all times and that Tusla has access to specialised placements.  The private foster placements includes services for emergency placements when Garda&iacute; have to intervene and remove a child to a place of safety.  All foster care, whether recruited directly by Tusla or sourced through private sector providers, operate using the same model of care.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carries out independent inspections of all foster care services in Ireland against the National Standards for Foster Care. </p>  <p>  The latest figures from Tusla indicate at the end of  January, 2017, there were 6,323 children in care.  Of these, over 92% are in foster care, either with relatives or a general foster placement.</p></reply>

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service.  One of the supports offered under AIM - Level 7 - is additional capitation.  Where approval for additional capitation has been agreed, and in circumstances where the maximum capitation has been approved, it can be used in one of two ways.  It can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room, from 1 adult and 11 children down to 1 adult and 8 children, without any financial loss to the pre-school provider.  Alternatively, it can be used to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. </p>  <p>  Applicants who intend to use additional capitation provided under AIM Level 7 to employ an additional person for the pre-school room or increase hours for existing staff must ensure that such staff have a Level 5 major award in early childhood care and education.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 allow for an exemption to the qualification requirements for an employee of a registered childcare provider receiving funding under Level 7 of AIM where it has deemed that specialised health support, for example nursing care, is required.  In limited circumstances, an exemption may be granted by Pobal where it has considered that such specialist support is required and is critical to the child's meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Such exemptions will primarily be for children with medically complex needs.  The service would need to request an exemption during the appraisal process or once funding has been approved prior to recruitment.</p>  <p>  When the Early Years Quality Agenda was introduced in 2013 to further improve quality in early years services, one of the items to be progressed was the introduction of a requirement that all staff working with children in pre-school services must hold the Level 5 major award in early childhood care and education.  The new qualification requirement is based on international evidence demonstrating that increasing the qualification levels of staff in childcare increases the quality of the service and therefore improves the outcomes for children using the service.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to review this qualification requirement as it relates to AIM at the present time.  However, this matter can be brought to the attention  of the Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group to consider.  It can also be considered in the context of planned reviews of AIM, the first of which will take place end 2017 with a full formal evaluation planned for 2019.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs does not fund Special Needs Assistants.</p><p>The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), which is a programme of supports to enable children with a disability to access and fully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service.  One of the supports offered under AIM - Level 7 - is additional capitation.  Where approval for additional capitation has been agreed, and in circumstances where the maximum capitation has been approved, it can be used in one of two ways.  It can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room, from 1 adult and 11 children down to 1 adult and 8 children, without any financial loss to the pre-school provider.  Alternatively, it can be used to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  Further information is available at .</p></reply>

The amendment to the Act is primarily concerned with aftercare &ndash; the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him or her in making the transition to independent living.  The legislation imposes a statutory duty on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, following an assessment of need, to prepare an aftercare plan identifying relevant aftercare supports for an eligible child or eligible young person.  It is anticipated that the relevant provisions of the Act will be commenced in Q2 of this year.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the commencement of this new legislation, Tusla has introduced a number of new practices.  It has developed dedicated aftercare teams and it continues to roll out inter-agency steering committees to strongly promote good co-ordination of these services at local level.  Tusla is identifying gaps in the aftercare service nationally and has undertaken a major recruitment campaign of social care workers to fill aftercare post vacancies.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has consulted with all key stakeholders in order to finalise the revision of its Aftercare policy.  The consultation process has included foster carers, young people / young adults, aftercare staff, social work staff, NGO's, private foster care and residential care providers and other State Departments.  All have been invited to events and offered the opportunity to make written submissions.  Following these consultations, feedback will be considered, amendments made to the draft document, and the final draft of the Aftercare documents will be presented to the National Policy Oversight Committee in Tusla for approval. The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will be commenced as soon as practicable after approval of the revised policy.</p>  <p>   I believe that our young people leaving care deserve high quality supports throughout the system, and that full implementation of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 will be a key element of how our society helps them to make this critical transition in their lives.</p></reply>

Individual commitments remain the responsibility of relevant Departments or Agencies.</p><p>While <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures </i>is a universal framework which applies to all children and young people from birth to 24, it recognises that certain groups of children and young people face additional barriers to achieving their goals and aspirations in life.  This includes traveller children and young people.  <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>contains a range of commitments to Traveller children, addressing issues such as health, education, and social inclusion.</p><p>In the case of commitment 5.6:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Reduce discrimination and intolerance of all types experienced by marginalised groups (i.e. Travellers, Roma, migrants and asylum-seekers; children and young people with disabilities; those in care and detention; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people; and those from ethnic or religious minorities).&rdquo;<br /><br />Lead responsibility for this commitment rests with the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Justice and Equality is also responsible for the development of the Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy which is nearing completion.

The <i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making </i>(2015-2020) contains specific actions to strengthen participation in decision-making by Traveller children and young people.  My Department also provides annual funding to support specific projects which are targeted at young Travellers; and offer a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people at risk and who are disadvantaged, due to a combination of factors such as social isolation, substance misuse; involvement in crime; homelessness; early school-leaving and unemployment.</p></reply>

I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party. </p><p>At the end of January 2017 (the latest data available), there was a total of 25,189 open child welfare and protection cases nationwide.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of the 25,189 open cases, 80% (20,173) had an allocated social worker and 5,016 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of the children awaiting allocation to a social worker at the end of January, 2017 their priority levels were as follows:<table><tr><th>Level of Priority</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Low Priority</td><td>1,287</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Priority</td><td>2,886</td></tr><tr><td>High Priority</td><td>843</td></tr></table></p><p>Information on the length of time a child has been awaiting allocation to a social worker is available in respect of the high priority cases.  Of the 843 high priority cases awaiting allocation, 271 were waiting less than a month, 194 were waiting one to three months and 378 were waiting in excess of three months.  Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker.  Cases to be allocated to a social worker include children who have already received services from Tusla whose social worker is no longer available to them, as well as children waiting to be allocated for the first time.  All unallocated cases are assessed and prioritised according to risk.  </p><p>It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  Tusla currently has 1,467 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.</p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.  I attach a high priority to tackling this matter and I will continue to engage directly with the Tusla Board and senior management team, over the course of the year, to review progress.</p></reply>

This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p>  <p>  Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement, however in 2011 due to austerity this scheme was closed and no new applications have been accepted since 2011.  Since 2011 the grantees who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefitting from this scheme.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.  Opening up the scheme nationally with a current budget allocation of &euro;245,000 is not an option as this equates to less than &euro;60 per school.  Hence the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format.</p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services informed grantees in January 2016 and as part of the 2016/2017 grant application process reconfirmed that the scheme would not operate for 2017/2018.  Tusla Educational Welfare Services wrote again to confirm this in January 2017.</p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Welfare Services is very supportive of the provision of appropriate school counselling supports and the option of continuing the scheme with adequate funding to provide the opportunity to all schools and School Completion Programmes nationally.  All School Completion Programmes have been requested to identify their unmet as part of their annual plan for 2017/18 due on 21 April.</p>  <p>  Identified gaps in service, including counselling provision for bereavement and loss, will be reviewed on the basis of the information provided in the 2017/18 annual plans.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-04-11a.2134.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017041100109#WRBBB00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 807 to 809, inclusive, together.</p><p>In 1994 the Department of Social Welfare opened a grant scheme to provide counselling supports to children who had experienced bereavement or loss.  This grant scheme then passed to the Family Support Agency (FSA) when it was established in 2003 and subsequently to Tusla on establishment in January 2014. </p><p>Up until 2011 applications were invited through an annual public advertisement, however in 2011 due to austerity this scheme was closed and no new applications have been accepted since 2011.  Since 2011 the grantees who received funding in 2011 have continued to receive an annual grant equivalent to their 2011 grant.  This Counselling Grants Scheme is for a total of &euro;245,900 annually and currently there are only 64 grantees nationwide benefiting from this scheme.  With over 4,000 schools in Ireland 64 grantees means that less than 2% of schools are in receipt of support from this scheme currently.</p><p>The Counselling Grants Scheme which was originally established to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss was affected by austerity cuts in 2010.  The need for bereavement and loss counselling still exists in schools right around the country however without a significantly increased budget it is unfair and unethical to continue providing support to a small number of areas (64 grantees) while excluding all other schools from the scheme.  Opening up the scheme nationally with a current budget allocation of &euro;245,000 is not an option as this equates to less than &euro;60 per school.  Hence the decision was made to cease the scheme in its current format.</p><p>Tusla Educational Welfare Services is very supportive of the provision of appropriate school counselling supports and the option of continuing the scheme with adequate funding to provide the opportunity to all schools and School Completion Programmes nationally.  All School Completion Programmes have been requested to identify unmet needs as part of their annual plan for 2017/18 due on 21<sup>st</sup>April.  Identified gaps in service, including counselling provision for bereavement and loss, will be reviewed on the basis of the information provided in the 2017/18 annual plans.</p><p>I can confirm that one secondary school in County Kerry<font color="#004080"> </font>has been affected by the cut to the counselling grant.  The amount allocated to schools in County Kerry for counselling in the years 2011 to 2016 is set out in the following table.</p><p>County Kerry Allocation:<table><tr><th>2011 </th><th>&euro;7,500</th></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>&euro;6,600</td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;5,700</td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>&euro;5,200</td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>&euro;5,200</td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>&euro;5,200</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services, and communities throughout the country.

It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people.</p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department hosted a meeting for all thirty organisations on 5th  April.  The meeting was held to ascertain their views on how the scheme had worked for them over the preceding years and how best the scheme could be reformed.  I am advised that the meeting was a great success and that each of the organisations is now fully engaged in, and committed to the review.  This will be the first of a number of planned collaborations with youth organisations and services, young people and other stake-holders. </p>  <p>  I am committed to having progressed this review before the end of 2017.</p></reply>

Tusla is identifying gaps in the aftercare service nationally and has undertaken a major recruitment campaign of social care workers to fill aftercare post vacancies. </p>  <p>  Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age.  A child is eligible for an aftercare plan when the child spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and (up to) 18 years old.  Young people who leave State care can avail of advice, guidance and practical support to assist them make the transition to independent living.  Aftercare workers engage with the young person, his or her family, foster carers, social workers, key residential social care workers and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies.  Consent and engagement from the young adult is essential in delivering an effective and robust aftercare provision. It is important to recall that as young adults, those leaving care, sometimes, do not avail of the support that Tusla might provide. </p>  <p>  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships, secure, suitable accommodation and further education, employment or training.  There were a total of 1,806 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of aftercare supports from Tusla at the end of  2016.  Of this group, 58% (1,040) were in full-time education.  In terms of living arrangements, 46% of the 18-22 year olds remained with their carers, 10% returned home, 27% were in independent living arrangements and 5% were in a residential placement.  </p>  <p>  During Quarter 4, 2016 a total of 138 young adults were discharged from care by reason of reaching 18 years.  92% (127) were eligible for an aftercare service and of these 89% (113) were availing of the service.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all 113 had an allocated social worker.  Tusla has informed me in 2016, a total of 605 young persons in care turned 18 years of age.  Of these, 584 young people were eligible for aftercare supports and 524 availed of the aftercare supports which were offered to them.</p></reply>

This period commences when the member departs the State to serve with the Force and ends when he returns to the State, having finished serving with the Force. Active Service in relation to service with a United Nations Force is confined to the service &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo; during that tour of duty.</p><p>In relation to express exemptions under Section 6(2) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, Section 6 states:</p><blockquote>&ldquo;(1) The relevant statutory provisions apply to prisons and places of detention unless their application is incompatible with safe custody, good order and security.<br /><br />(2) Subject to section 11, the relevant statutory provisions apply to members of the Defence Forces except when they are&mdash;(a) on active service within the meaning of section 5 of the Defence Act 1954 or deemed to be on active service within the meaning of section 4(1) of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960,<br /><br />(b) engaged in action in the course of operational duties at sea,<br /><br />(c) engaged in operations in aid to the civil power, or<br /><br />(d) engaged in training directly associated with any of the activities specified in paragraph (a) to (c).&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Exemptions to relevant statutory obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 can only be applied if they come within the scope of Section 6(2) of that Act.</p></reply>
