The Act provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The local authority water tariffs that applied prior to 1 January 2014 still apply to non-domestic customers.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has indicated that it will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations, so that an enduring tariff framework can be established for non-domestic charges.  The CER will publish the time-line for this process before the end of 2014.</p><p>  The local authorities, acting as agents of Irish Water have continued billing, collections and billing/metering query functions in relation to non-domestic customers.  Non-domestic customer data is scheduled to migrate from local authorities to Irish Water during 2015.</p></reply>

While we do not have a nuclear power industry in this country, it is the Government&rsquo;s long-standing position that, where another State chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this should be done in accordance with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection. Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. In this regard, the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Radiological Protection (formerly the RPII), carries out an environmental radioactivity monitoring programme throughout Ireland and has regularly monitored levels of radioactivity in the Irish environment since 1982.      </p><p>  Ireland has been involved in the consultation process on the new-build nuclear programme in the UK, which was announced in 2009.  We have written twice at Ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea from the new-build programme. The key issues of concern include the UK&rsquo;s assessments of effects on the environment, the management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the assessment by the RPII in 2012 that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants , including Hinkley Point, would have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment, a finding backed up by the European Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the programme&rsquo;s possible transboundary impacts, my Department will continue to actively engage with the UK authorities to ensure they are fully aware of any concerns arising in relation to their proposed programme. </p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.    The strategy provides a clear governance structure, which as Minister I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery of all actions. Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector. </p><p>  The specific funding to be provided in 2015 across all the various schemes and programmes will shortly be published in the 2 015 Revised Estimates Volume.  However, I expect that 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives, broken down as follows:   3,000 units will be provided through the leasing initiative; 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units will be delivered; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use through a programme of refurbishment; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme.     In addition, a further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p></reply>

As stated in the reply, the Group was established to facilitate engagement with the Unions and staff on the roll-out of the Water Sector Reform Implementation Strategy, and had its inaugural meeting in September 2012.  This joint union/management group was established to provide a mechanism for regular structured dialogue, consultation and engagement on issues arising from the implementation strategy, including service level agreements.  These service level agreements signed between Irish Water and individual local authorities were based on a generic template, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at under the water services section.<br/><br/>Representation on the Group is a matter for each of the respective organisations rather than by appointment by the Chairman and my consent, as Minister, is not required.<br/><br/>The Union side is represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and comprises up to 8 representatives from Congress, SIPTU, IMPACT and the Local Authority Craft Group of Unions.<br/><br/>The Management side is represented by officials from my Department&rsquo;s Water Services and Local Government (Human Resources) Divisions; representatives from the County and City Management Association, the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and the Water Services Transition Office; and Irish Water/Ervia. <br/><br/>The Group is under the stewardship of an independent chair, Mr. Kevin Foley , Director of Conciliation Services at the Labour Relations Commission.  The role of the Chairman is that of an impartial facilitator of discussions and conciliator of differences in the attempt to problem-solve through dialogue at the Group.  The Chairman has no role as a decision maker or arbitrator.<br/><br/>The LGMA hosts the meetings of the Group and provides secretariat services and is responsible for holding all records of the Group.  As I stated in my reply last week, and in the interests of openness and transparency, I have asked the LGMA to forward the minutes including the attendees lists directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.  Housing authorities provide additional funding from their own resources.  Funding from my Department for homeless services has been substantially protected over recent years, despite the significant pressure for reductions in Government spending across all Departments. In 2014, my Department&rsquo;s funding for homelessness was maintained at the 2013 level of &euro;45 million.  Individual regional allocations were also maintained at the same level as 2013 and &euro;649,707 was allocated in respect of the Midlands Region.  </p><p>  The Budget 2015 announcement confirmed that an additional &euro;10.5 million will be available, through my Department, for homeless accommodation and related services across the country in 2015.  This is an increase in funding of over 20% bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;55.5 million.  My Department is currently considering the appropriate allocation of this funding so as to ensure that Section 10 homelessness funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.  The additional funding will ensure continued progress toward the achievement of the 2016 target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness and will assist in meeting commitments outlined in the Implementation Plan on the State&rsquo;s Response to Homelessness.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47 million pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015. </p><p>  My Department currently provides LCDP funding to Comhar na nOilean Teoranta (the Local Development Company for the Islands) for the delivery of LCDP to off-shore islands.  In terms of the successor programme (SICAP), the intention is that island areas would be eligible for inclusion within the tendering process which is currently underway and is due to be completed in February 2015. The SICAP programme funding allocations are informed by a specific Resource Allocation Model, or RAM, which focuses on relative disadvantage of individual areas.</p><p>  Discussions have taken place recently between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, which has lead responsibility for the islands, in response to issues raised regarding the continuation of funding for the Development Offices on a number of non-Gaeltacht Islands. This reflected the fact that the issues involved are broader than just those relating to SICAP. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that both Departments fully understand the importance of the community development infrastructure on these islands and I and my colleague, Minister Humphreys, will be ensuring that both our Departments continue to  collaborate to agree a workable solution in the matter. In the meantime, LCDP funding for the groups concerned will continue until the end of March 2015. </p></reply>

However, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme. Irish Water has submitted a draft first fix policy to the Commission for Energy Regulation for approval. It is understood that the CER intend to hold a public consultation in advance of a decision and implementation of this scheme in early 2015.  Householders normally engage their own plumbers or builders to address related problems on their property. This will remain the position, and other than services up to the meter and the free first fix scheme, Irish Water will not be offering such additional services (accepting that there may be circumstances where services will need to be provided in the wider public interest on grounds of public health or imminent environmental pollution). This issue is currently being considered in the context of the legislative provisions required to give effect to recent decisions made by Government in relation to domestic water charges.   </p></reply>

These draft revisions propose:  <br/><br/>- The setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,<br/><br/>- A mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and<br/><br/>- The complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. <br/><br/>A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014. My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period. <br/><br/>The 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines continue to apply to existing planning applications.Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to those statutory guidelines, issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.<br/><br/>In relation to initiating a moratorium on decisions, I am precluded under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. My priority is focused on finalising the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines and I am determined to conclude that process as a matter of urgency, taking into account the large number of public submissions received.</p></reply>

Subsequently, an Inter-Departmental Working Group was established in October 2013 to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which might arise with the introduction of domestic water charges. The Group considered the ESRI study as part of their examination of the issues. The report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group, which includes the study carried out by the ESRI, has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website; details of the relevant link will be circulated with the official report.  .]<br/><br/>In May 2014 the Government made certain decisions on the funding model for Irish Water. Subsequently, in July, the Water Charges Policy Direction 2014issued to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in accordance with Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act setting out the Government&rsquo;s water charges policy framework. In making its decisions on the funding model and the policy framework, the Government took account of the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group. <br/><br/>Following a review of the overarching water charges policy framework, the Government has made further decisions to ensure that water charges are affordable for customers. On 19 November, I announced a package of measures to ensure that a simpler, fairer, more certain and more affordable charging regime is in place for Irish Water customers. Details of these measures are also available on my Department's s website; the relevant weblink will be circulated with the official report.<br/><br/>[</p></reply>

In committing to provide 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland<i>. </i>It is estimated that this level of investment will create or sustain some 29,000 construction industry jobs.  Importantly,  the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through a resumption of direct building on a significant scale, primarily by local authorities and approved housing bodies. <br/><br/>The strategy will be delivered in two phases.  Phase 1 targets  the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32, 4 00 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)  and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units.<br/><br/>In the initial phase, increased Exchequer funding is necessary to underpin delivery . The Government has already committed this initial funding , through the &euro;2.2 billion announced as part of Budget 2015 . The provision of this funding will allow time for the work to be carried out to move towards more off-balance sheet funding, through the extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a large scale Public Private Partnership (PPP) and the establishment of a &lsquo; Strategic Housing Fund&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The strategy provides a clear governance structure, which as Minister I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery of all actions. Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector. For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives broken down as follows: 3,000 units through the leasing initiative; 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be refurbished and brought back to use; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and Capital Assistance Scheme. A further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). </p></reply>

In late 2011, the European Commission offered Member States that were part of the Financial Stabilisation Mechanism an opportunity to avail of an increased co-financing rate from 55% up to 85%. The increased rate was to apply to 2012 and 2013 expenditure only. This reduced the Programme value to approximately &euro;370 million and was based on the co-financing rate returning to 55% for 2014 and 2015. In December 2013, the European Commission revised their position and allowed Member States to continue to avail of the increased co-financing rate of 85% for 2014 and 2015. That had the effect of reducing the official EU Programme complement to approximately &euro;317 million. Up to 20% of the Programme compliment can be spent on administration with the remaining 80% on animation and projects.    Although the official Programme complement has been reduced, due to the more beneficial co-financing rate, my Department will honour all valid contractual obligations. </p><p>  Overall expenditure under the Programme to 25 November 2014 is &euro;315.2 million, of which &euro;75.5 million has been paid in 2014. That expenditure includes &euro;242.8 million for projects, &euro;11.8 million for animation expenses and &euro;60.6 million for administration. </p></reply>

My Department had no involvement in the award of the contracts for the water metering programme.Following a tender process, the final cost of the metering programme was determined at &euro;539m excluding VAT. The cost reflects the outcome of the procurement process taking account of the overall logistics of a programme of this scale and complexity. <br/><br/>The initial estimates of the cost of the domestic metering programme were based largely on the experience of the non-domestic metering programme, the group water sector and market soundings, as there was no precedent for a programme of this scale over a very short duration. The estimate was based on much smaller scale projects than the national domestic metering programme and was not a definitive budget. As with all capital projects, estimates are refined as the detailed technical scoping of the project evolves, including matters such as appropriate risk allocation and programme management and, ultimately, it is the competitive process that determines the price. The final budget figure reflects the outcome of the detailed scoping of the project and the procurement process.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide. The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578. </p></reply>

The Bill includes a provision that the CER will provide a dispute resolution service for customers of Irish Water. This will be similar to the service operated by the Commission for the gas and electricity markets.  </p></reply>

The occupier of a property is liable to pay the water charges bill, and legislation provides that the owner is the occupier unless the contrary is proven. Irish Water is providing landlords with the opportunity to prove that they are not the occupier by providing the tenants name. This will allow Irish Water to contact the tenant to complete the registration and to bill the tenant. The tenant will have to register with Irish Water to avail of the water conservation grant or to get lower charges than the default capped charge (&euro;260), where they are single adult occupants or their metered usage is less than the maximum charge.   </p><p>  Draft legislation which I will be bringing forward will place certain obligations on landlords where the tenant has not paid charges. In the case of tenants in private rented accommodation, the legislation will seek to insert into all tenancy agreements/leases a deemed obligation on the tenant to discharge their liability for water charges.   I n the event of a tenant not discharging their water charges , the landlord would be entitled to withhold the amount of arrears concerned from the tenant&rsquo;s deposit and would be required to remit the amount involved to Irish Water.   </p><p>  In the case of local authority tenants, where deposit arrangements do not apply, and where a customer is in arrears for more than 12 months and a late payment fee has accrued, Irish Water, having firstly provided the customer with the opportunity to pay the arrears or enter into a payment plan, will advise the local authority concerned of the amount of the arrears.  It is envisaged that the legislation would provide for the local authority to recover the amount outstanding over a 12 month period and to remit the amount involved to Irish Water. </p><p>  These scenarios can be avoided by entering into a payment plan with Irish Water. Various easypay options will be made available through post offices or other payment providers. The overall net cost for those who register is either &euro;1.15 a week for single adult households or &euro;3 a week for all others. Water supply will be not be reduced under any circumstance.   </p><p>  My Department will be consulting with the local government sector, social housing providers and landlord and tenant representatives in the course of drafting the necessary legislation to give effect to the measures proposed. </p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  The Strategy builds on the projected delivery for 2015 and commits to providing 35,000 new social housing units over the period to 2020, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, marking a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.  The strategy will be delivered in two phases. Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units.</p><p>  The Government has already committed to increased Exchequer funding to underpin delivery during the strategy&rsquo;s initial phase, through the &euro;2.2 billion announced as part of Budget 2015. The provision of this funding will allow time for the work to be carried out to move towards more off-balance sheet funding, through the extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a large scale Public Private Partnership (PPP) and the establishment of a &lsquo;Strategic Housing Fund&rsquo;. </p><p>  The strategy provides a clear governance structure, which as Minister I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery of all actions.  Action 6 in the Strategy relates to the establishment of a finance working group to progress, inter alia, off-balance sheet funding mechanisms.  This working group, which will be established without delay , will be resourced with appropriate expertise in order to progress the establishment of the &lsquo;Strategic Housing Fund&rsquo; and the Public Private Partnership, including the consideration of any legislative requirements that might arise. </p></reply>

Informed by a recent review of the Part V provisions, which included a public consultation process, my Department has published the General Scheme of the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill 2014 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:. <br/><br/>The Bill is in the process of being drafted with a view to enactment in 2015.<br/><br/>The General Scheme provides that, in future, the focus of Part V will be on social housing, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments in excess of 9 units. In the operation of these revised Part V arrangements, the priority will be to secure social housing units on-site; the monetary alternative in lieu of social housing is to be discontinued. <br/><br/>It is proposed that the new Part V arrangements may be applied retrospectively to existing planning permissions where the developer and the planning authority are in agreement. I believe that this approach will encourage the commencement of private developments that might not have commenced otherwise and as a consequence will lead to an increased social housing gain from private developments.</p></reply>

Permissive  access, which does not attract any incentive or compensation, will continue to be a key tool in the delivery of these types of recreational infrastructure going forward.  My Department has responsibility for the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy (NCRS).<br/><br/><b>The </b>Strategic Objectives<b>set out in the Strategy are:</b><br/><br/>1.  To achieve sustainable and responsible recreation in the countryside.<br/><br/>2.  To promote caring recreational use of the countryside.<br/><br/>3.  To develop a national framework that promotes the rights and responsibilities of both owners and users.<br/><br/>4.  To develop a suitable structure to deliver a national countryside recreation service in a strategic and co-ordinated way.<br/><br/>5.  To secure a package of funding mechanisms to deliver on the objectives of the strategy.<br/><br/>The on-going development of the activity tourism sector is of strategic importance for Ireland given the potential to leverage job creation and improve exchequer revenue from both foreign and domestic tourism. <br/><br/>The Walks Scheme which was introduced in 2008 is currently in place on 39 trails nationally, with 1,895 landholder participants. These participants receive modest payments for the development, enhancement and maintenance of those sections of trail that traverse their lands. In 2014 payments to landowners amounted to &euro;1.8m. Due to budgetary constraints this scheme is currently closed to new participants; however, in some cases, a number of new participants have been brought on to the scheme following the renewal of contracts. In 2014, over 90 new participants joined the scheme. <br/><br/>The permissive access model currently used as part of the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategyfor the development of greenways and walkways in Ireland has led to the successful delivery of close on 800 walking, cycling, and equestrian trails which are all listed on the Irish Trails Register. <br/><br/>My Department continues to be a main funder of the Leave No Trace initiative which, through partnerships and education,  promotes responsible recreational use in the outdoors, thus minimising the inconvenience caused to landholders and farm animals alike.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme is designed to bring together all the social housing services provided by the State, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need, including those whose needs are currently being met through long-term rent supplement.  HAP has a number of objectives including the removal of a potential barrier to employment , by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment; provision of a better integrated and more streamlined service; and better regulation of the private rented sector.   Implementation of the scheme is being overseen by a high level Oversight Group, which is co-chaired by the Secretaries General of my Department and of the Department of Social Protection.   </p><p>  Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. Subsequently, from 1 October HAP, commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils. It is intended that Dublin City Council be part of the statutory pilot in the near future, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. In order to provide efficiencies and to test HAP processes, Limerick City and County Council is providing a transactional shared service to other local authorities during the pilot phase.   </p><p>  There are now 253 households in receipt of HAP across 6 of the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot. South Dublin County Council is currently assessing new applicants for HAP and expects to start moving recipients onto HAP in the coming weeks.   </p><p>  I understand that the average differential rent payment being made by HAP recipients to the local authority at present is &euro;40 per week. The average monthly rent being paid to landlords under the pilot phase of the scheme is &euro;462 across all classes of households.   </p><p>  During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee that would include a full review of the statutory pilot phase. Data for the report are being gathered from pilot sites and the report will be compiled and submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in early 2015, in advance of full roll out of the Scheme.</p></reply>

These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector. </p><p>  For 2015, the targets for new social housing units to be delivered as part of the local authority housing construction and acquisitions programme is 946, and a further 440 through approved housing bodies under the Capital Assistance Scheme. This will contribute to the overall provision of some 7,400 new social housing units next year under the range of existing initiatives, with a further 8,400 households assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment. </p><p>While local authorities are responsible for the detailed planning of social housing provision based on the needs of their areas, my Department is working with all authorities, within the context of the increased funding now available, to advance projects already in train and to plan for further developments directly by local authorities and by approved housing bodies to meet the Social Housing Strategy targets for 2015 and beyond. </p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and from this it was recommended that the scheme be managed by Pobal with effect from 1 January 2015, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.   </p><p>  Pobal will provide management and administrative services for the Seniors Alert Scheme. This will include a national tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. A panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. </p><p>  Monitoring has always been the responsibility of the beneficiary and this is not changing. There are no implications for existing installations in respect of the Pobal tender competition; however, under the new arrangements, Pobal are also providing a facility for beneficiaries to choose from a panel of monitoring companies or to continue with their current monitoring company. In this regard Pobal will also set up a panel of pre-qualified telecare service providers who provide monitoring services and this was publicly advertised on eTenders on 6 November 2014. </p><p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme and it will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to interact with the elderly in the local community.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.   Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case. A determination order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply. In making determination orders, the PRTB-appointed adjudicators, mediators or Tribunal members as the case may be, can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.   </p><p>  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts. Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case. However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously. During 2013, it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts including the seeking of a garnishee order. </p><p>It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award. In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments. I have no plans to amend the legislation in respect of the enforcement of determination orders. </p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent). The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.   On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012. The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions. </p><p>  A total of 2,558 cases have been submitted to the end of October. 1,034 were ineligible or terminated during the process with a further 46 units not progressing as agreement on the sale could not be reached.   50 transactions have been completed under the scheme. 1,044 are currently with lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 384 are actively being progressed. </p><p>  Separately, my Department has funded 36 cases to date under the Local Authority scheme. The Department currently has 40 LA mortgage to rent applications on hand and expects to receive a small number of additional applications by the end of 2014.   </p><p>  In an effort to increase the numbers delivered under the AHB scheme a new protocol between all parties in the process was agreed and came into operation in June 2014 .  The protocol includes such measures as the provision of a single independent valuation for the purpose of agreeing the purchase price. The valuation and condition surveys will now be carried out earlier in the process to give more certainty to all parties in the process including the borrower. The new protocol is endeavouring to ensure that as much certainty is being provided as early as possible in the process to minimise uncertainty and late withdrawals from the scheme.   </p><p>Also in June 2014 , my Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within their sector under the LA scheme. There are currently no plans to amend the LA scheme but its workings will be kept under constant review. I am confident that delivery will accelerate as a result of these changes.   </p></reply>

In this regard, the Government have recently given approval for the preparation of a new Planning Bill to facilitate the implementation of certain planning-related actions in the Construction 2020 strategy, including provision for the introduction of a vacant sites levy. Under this provision, local authorities, in urban centres of greater than 3,000 population, will be given powers to apply annual levies of 3% of the value of sites which are left vacant and underutilised in areas designated for priority development under their respective local development plan schemes and strategies. The full details of the levy will be finalised during the drafting of the Bill. </p><p>The General Scheme of the relevant legislation &ndash; the Planning and Development (No.1) Bill 2014 - has been sent to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in order to facilitate pre-legislative scrutiny.

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, HAP is deemed to be a social housing support and, consequently, households in receipt of HAP are not entitled to remain on the local authority waiting list for social housing support. However, HAP recipients may access other social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.</p><p>  HAP has been rolled out in seven local authority areas on a pilot basis. As an immediate step, I have issued a statutory direction to the seven authorities involved, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option. I have also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.</p><p>  Prior to the full roll-out of HAP, my Department will undertake a review of the transfer option with the seven pilot authorities. This will inform the overall review of the housing allocation system which is a key action under the Social Housing Strategy. Once the review is complete, I will make the necessary Regulations to ensure that the transfer option for HAP recipients operates consistently and effectively as part of the national roll-out of the new scheme.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave resulting from the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstances, such as the presence of contaminants in concrete blocks as appears to be the case in County Donegal. I have no proposals to amend the Act in this regard.</p><p>  The scheme, which was published by the Pyrite Resolution Board in February of 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013. The Panel was established in September 2011 to explore options for a resolution to the problem of pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which at that time had manifested itself in dwellings in a number of areas. The Panel reported in July 2012.</p><p>  Any proposal to amend the scheme would, in the first instance, be a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence deemed necessary to support the case for an amendment to the scheme.  The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel to establish a pyrite remediation scheme to include dwellings in the functional areas of Dublin city, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly were premised on a number of pertinent factors and I would support the view that similar factors would need to be examined in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.</p><p>  I refer to the reply to Question No. 318 of 14 October 2014 which sets out the information that would be required for the Board in order to consider an amendment to the scheme to include the functional area of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p></reply>

The report of the independent Pyrite Panel (July 2012) provides the framework for the remediation scheme and the eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of the report.  The Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be included.</p><p>  The scheme, which was published by the Board in February 2014, was developed having regard to the recommendations set out in the report of the independent Pyrite Panel and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act. One of the eligibility criteria under the scheme is that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  To date the Pyrite Resolution Board has received almost 600 applications, the vast majority of which have met this eligibility requirement.</p><p>Dwellings with a Damage Condition Rating of 1 with progression do not qualify under the scheme although some may be considered for inclusion at a later stage if the Board is satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Act. I understand that all relevant information will be considered by the Board in advance of making any decisions in these matters.</p></reply>

The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment, unemployment and the labour force in the State.  Estimates of unemployment are produced by NUTS3 Region.  The South-West NUTS3 region comprises of Cork City, County Cork and County Kerry.  Due to methodology and sample size it is not possible to produce reliable estimates from the QNHS at County level.  The latest figures available from the QNHS are for Quarter 3 of 2014.<br/><br/>The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social Protection. It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance.<br/><br/>Table 1 shows the number of persons on the Live Register in County Kerry classified by age and duration of continuous registration in April of each year from 2008 to 2014.

The Government also undertook to look at making Article 41.2 of the Constitution on women in the home gender-neutral, and at including other carers both in and beyond the home; it also undertook to look at amending the Constitution to include the principle of gender equality, as well as at the use of gender-inclusive language in the Constitution.<br/><br/>The Government also announced earlier this year that work would commence on the establishment of an Electoral Commission, a key recommendation in the fourth Report of the Convention.  More recently, in response to the sixth Report of the Convention, the Government announced that it will bring forward proposals for a referendum on the removal from the Constitution of the offence of blasphemy.

The Department does not make exceptions to these qualifying criteria, and there are no plans to change them at present.<br/><br/>The Deputy may wish to note that the person referred to will become eligible for the scheme on 05/01/2015.</p></reply>

There are approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients, of which approximately 1,800 are in Donegal. The Government has provided a total of over &euro;344 million for the scheme 2014.</p><p>  The Department is finalising a review of the maximum rent limits under the rent supplement scheme.  I am concerned that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.</p><p>  Analysis also shows that there are some properties available in County Donegal within the maximum rent limits. However, I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers on a case by case basis, as necessary. A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014, including to staff  operating in the Donegal area.</p></reply>

Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme. The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. </p><p>  On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates.</p><p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-02a.212.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120200057#WRE01600"><p>In July 2008, the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors (LCR19293) and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the agency responsible for CE at that time.  The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for CE. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) and the unions representing CE supervisors.  The D/PER&rsquo;s position, as outlined to the unions, is that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, will have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels. </p><p>  Given the level of additional funding that would be required from this Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum. </p><p>  It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations as employers and the individuals concerned as employees must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</p><p>  Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  All CE sponsoring organisations were informed of their responsibilities under this Act at that time. </p><p>  It should also be noted that CE Supervisors may also qualify for the State Pension at 66 years of age.  If they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions (520 contributions @ full rate, equivalent to 10 years contributions) they will qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), which is not means-tested.  In the event that there are insufficient contributions, the person will qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), provided they satisfy the means test. </p></reply>

If speculation on Bitcoin occurs, then the taxation rules that would apply to any gain are applicable.</p><p>  More specifically, VAT is generally chargeable on the total consideration for goods and services, including all taxes, commissions, costs, and charges (excluding the VAT chargeable in respect of that supply).  This general rule is based on the EU VAT Directive. Where the consideration does not consist of, or does not consist wholly of, an amount of money, VAT is chargeable by reference to what might reasonably be expected to be the open-market (arm's length) price of the goods or services supplied. The VAT Regulations require that the amount of tax included on an invoice be expressed in Euro. The exchange rate to be used for non-Euro currency transactions is either the latest selling rate for the foreign currency recorded by the European Central Bank or an alternative method of determining the exchange rate that is agreed with Revenue.</p><p>  I am advised that Revenue has continued to monitor developments in Bitcoin (and other such currencies) during 2014. This includes using international fora to follow progress in other countries, in particular other Member States of the EU. However, as Bitcoin features a combination of some factors that constitute a commodity and some that constitute a currency, the implications for taxation are varied and there is as yet no consensus on the &quot;best practice&quot; approach for a tax administration.  Bitcoin also requires a coordinated response between Revenue, my Department and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>  While Bitcoin has the potential to be misused and lead to instances of non-compliance and tax evasion, I am advised that, at this point in time, the threat posed to the Exchequer is likely to be small.  It is probable too that for some evaders, it represents a new opportunity for existing non-compliance, rather than a new form of evasion.  </p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are proactively following developments in digital currencies and will act to advance their position publicly should events require this.</p></reply>

A total of 175 samples of petrol from Filling Stations and other sources have been taken for analysis following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.  The scientific analysis required is complex and time consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted extensive tests and re-tests on the samples.  Normally, when fraudsters attempt to &quot;stretch&quot; petrol, they add methanol, kerosene or other low excise duty agents.  Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of the presence of methanol, kerosene or any other known prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site on the eastern seaboard.  The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in seizure of the product, closure of the facility and a file is being prepared for prosecution.</p><p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results have been received in recent days which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations (including Co Mayo) during August and September.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol.  This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars in Co Mayo and elsewhere.  </p><p>  If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Deputies can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. </p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding new complaints in Co Mayo, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a total of 19 additional complaints from the public in Co. Mayo since 2 October 2014 (16 in October and 3 in November) with regard to problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing their investigation in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The investigation includes sharing of information and intelligence and intensive monitoring of the situation.</p><p>  Revenue are continuing to sample suspect fuel and to challenge fuel delivery tankers when encountered by Enforcement officers particularly throughout the Border Midlands West Region. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.  In Co Mayo 6 fuel delivery tankers were stopped and inspected during the month of October.  In the time available it is not possible to provide national figures.</p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding fuel import and distribution centres, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such centres must be approved by them as Authorised Warehouses.  Once approved, an authorised warehouse-keeper is at all times responsible for the duty on all oil products in the warehouse and must ensure that the oil in the warehouse is safeguarded and properly and fully accounted for.  Revenue maintains a permanent presence of control staff at the main Mineral Oil import depots throughout the country.  These officers engage on a daily basis with the authorised warehouse keepers and industry personnel on all compliance matters relating to oil, supervision of warehouse activities, approval of warehouse requests, accounting for excise duties and VAT, accounting for Customs duty, provision of statistics, and generally ensuring compliance by the various oil companies with relevant Revenue regulations.  </p><p>  In addition, as part of its routine compliance work Revenue actively monitor the mineral oil sector through analysis of monthly Return of Oil Movements and supply chain data. Any anomalies or breaches of Regulations detected are fully investigated as a matter of course.  </p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the main mineral oil distributors take daily samples of imported fuel on which they carry out quality assurance checks.  I have no plans currently to introduce testing at point of importation but I will of course keep the matter under review.</p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.</p><p>  Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.</p><p>  A relief did exist in the form of a benefit-in-kind exemption where childcare facilities were provided by the employer. However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011. The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs. To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children. While wanting to encourage participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less valuable contribution to society. </p><p>  In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax altogether. It could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones. In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

Under section 82(2), normal and reasonable payments made by a disponer, during his or her lifetime, for the support, maintenance or education of their children (including the children of a civil partner), or to a person to whom the disponer stands in loco parentis, or to a dependent relative of the disponer, are exempt from CAT.</p><p>  This Section 82 exemption is being amended in this year's Finance Bill, because the Revenue Commissioners in the course of carrying out Revenue compliance programmes have established that this exemption is being abused to provide significant tax-free gifts of money and assets to adult children far in advance of the intention of the exemption. In addition, it has also been brought to the Revenue Commissioners' attention by a concerned tax practitioner that this exemption is subject to widespread abuse. The full extent to which this exemption is being abused cannot be determined because CAT is a self-assessment tax and there is no obligation to submit returns to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of any benefit that is legally exempt from tax under Section 82. </p><p>  The amendment to section 82(2) is intended to ensure, where there is a need to make provision for support, maintenance or education of children, that the exemption is confined to normal and reasonable payments made to minor children; to children under the age of 25 years who are in full-time education and to children regardless of age who are permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining themselves. </p><p>  It is important to note that, apart from this particular exemption, parents can make gifts to their children within certain limits, without giving rise to a CAT liability. For example, parents can each gift &euro;3,000 in any year to each of their children (that's &euro;6,000 a year to each child if both parents wish to make such gifts). Parents can also gift the same amounts to partners of their children (e.g. fianc&eacute;, fianc&eacute;e, daughter-in-law, son-in-law) free of CAT. In effect parents can gift up to &euro;12,000 in each year to their children and partners in these circumstances.</p><p>  Any such payments within these limits do not reduce the parent to child Group Threshold of &euro;225,000, which remains intact for future larger gifts and inheritances.</p></reply>

While further consolidation would have improved the headline deficit figure, I have a number of other issues to consider such as social cohesion and the need to safeguard the ongoing economic recovery.</p><p>  I agree wholeheartedly with the Council's view that we need to break the pattern of boom and bust economics evident in the past.  The fiscal framework, which this Government has put in place, will provide a valuable structure to guide fiscal policy over the coming years.  However, there are a number of technical and timing issues relating to EU implementation of fiscal rules which need to be resolved.  For example, the expenditure benchmark links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy.   The updated Commission projections on potential growth, on which assessment with the benchmark would be based, were not available in advance of the Budget.  As these estimates can display significant revisions, there was no solid basis to forecast assessed expenditure in the outer years.  This limitation was specifically highlighted in the budgetary documentation.  A fuller assessment will be contained in the SPU in April.  With regard to the revenue forecasts not reflecting Government's intention to reduce the tax burden in coming years, I would strongly make the point that this is the correct approach to take.  What is reflected in the budgetary arithmetic is what is being legislated for in the coming year.  Budgets cannot be framed on the basis of general policy principles such as that to reduce the level of income tax in the future.  These decisions will be taken on an annual basis taking account of the economic and fiscal situation at the time.</p></reply>

They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement.  Under the "ARF option" individuals are entitled, subject to conditions, to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, either purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax.  Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual. </p><p>  ARFs are managed and held by Qualifying Fund Managers and any investment income or capital gains arising is exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF.  Distributions or drawdowns from the ARF by the beneficial owner are subject to income tax at the owner's marginal rate. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers (QFMs) who hold and manage ARFs on behalf of individuals to make returns to Revenue in relation to the number of ARFs under management or the value of ARF assets held by them.  I am further advised that, as the income tax take from actual drawdowns from ARFs forms part of the total income tax take and is not readily identifiable within that overall income tax yield, it is not possible to provide the data requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  Separate tax collection data is available on the tax paid by QFMs on imputed or notional distributions from ARFs and &quot;vested&quot; PRSAs.  The deemed or imputed distribution arrangements were introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to encourage drawdowns from ARFs and 'vested' PRSAs (to which the notional distribution arrangements were extended in Finance Act 2012) so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement.  The imputed distribution arrangements, under which a percentage of the value of assets in an ARF or &quot;vested&quot; PRSA is deemed to be distributed each year (unless sums equivalent to that value are actually drawndown), are not intended to nor do they give rise to significant tax revenues as they do not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and 'vested' PRSAs which are taxed in the normal way.  By way of indication, the amounts received by the Revenue Commissioners from tax paid on imputed distributions has averaged about &euro;4 million per annum in the period 2007 to 2013.</p></reply>

In this case, where a charity produces a CD and supplies it themselves, it will be exempt from VAT in Ireland.  However, where a charity makes an arrangement with a CD distributor to supply the charity CD on their behalf, then the CD sales are liable to VAT at the 23% VAT rate. </p><p>  The situation is different again in the case of electronically supplied music.  Under the current rules which apply until 31 December 2014, supplies of music, including charity singles, within the EU are charged to VAT in the Member State of the supplier.  In this case, if the Band Aid single is being supplied from the UK, UK VAT rules will apply to that sale.  Supplies of electronically supplied music into Europe, for the most part, are made from Luxembourg, where the VAT charged on these sales is at the standard VAT rate applying in Luxembourg.  From 1 January 2015 the place of supply for electronically supplied music, including charity singles, will be the place of the consumer, and as such sales of electronically supplied music to Irish consumers will be liable to Irish VAT.  In all cases, the standard VAT rate is the VAT rate charged on CD and electronically supplied music.</p><p>  The VAT treatment of goods and services is guided by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Other than where supplied by a person who is exempt from VAT, such as a charity, the VAT Directive does not make provision for exempting from VAT the supply of CDs or electronically supplied music, whether the supply is for charitable purposes or not. </p><p>  With regard to the UK Government's press release agreeing &quot;to waive VAT on sales of the Band Aid anniversary single&quot;, from a technical perspective, and given EU VAT constraints, it is not clear what specific arrangements are being proposed by the UK, nor what arrangements are in place between the Band Aid charity and the distributor of the charity single in this regard.  </p><p>   </p></reply>

Indeed, the Economic and Fiscal Outlook that accompanied Budget 2015 contained a box on the issue to which the Deputy may wish to refer if he requires a detailed explanation of the impact of contracted production:().  However, it is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to growth cannot be calculated with precision with the publicly available data to hand. <br/><br/>It should be recalled that large movements in GDP relating to activities of the foreign-owned sector in Ireland are not new. Foreign-owned firms are generally large, high-turnover enterprises concentrated in certain sectors. As such firm-specific and product-specific devleopments can have a bearing on measured GDP.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding these developments relating to contracted production, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory.  Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month.  This recovery has manifested itself in tax revenues which are expected to come in &euro;1 billion (or 2.5 per cent) above original expectations. <br/><br/>Returning to the issue of contracted production, it should be recalled that it involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports.  As developments are sector-specific and product-specific they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP.  National accounts estimates for the third quarter of this year are due for publication in mid-December and will show the most recent developments in contracted production.</p></reply>

The contribution formula for the EU Budget is comprised of Traditional Own Resources (customs duties), a VAT-based payment and a residual balancing component paid in accordance with each Member State's (MS) share of EU Gross National Income (GNI).</p><p>  Annually, a technical rebalancing exercise is carried out which retrospectively adjusts MS preceding years' budget contributions.  This exercise not only takes account of updated MS GNI, but also updated VAT data.  These balancing payments are called up for automatic payment, in accordance with the relevant legislation, on 1st December each year. </p><p>  In parallel with this, the Commission has proposed Draft Amending Budget 6 (DAB 6) which includes a technical redistribution of these balancing payments across MS and also takes account of updated Traditional Own Resources forecasts.  The net impact of these two exercises is an estimated additional contribution of &euro;6.5m for Ireland.  (Separately, under DAB6, the forecast for Ireland's Traditional Own Resources has been updated by &euro;6m.).  It should be noted that, whereas the payment under the technical balancing exercise is automatic, DAB 6 must be agreed by both Council (QMV) and Parliament. </p><p>  Since the publication of DAB 6, the Commission has proposed an amendment to the applicable EU legislation which if adopted would allow member states, under certain conditions, to defer making their balancing payments to 1st September 2015.  The result would be that balancing payments received on December 1st would be redistributed this year.  Where member states opt to make their balancing payments after this, a new draft amending budget would have to be proposed in 2015 to redistribute these monies. </p><p>  Accordingly, the full net impact of the additional &euro;6.5m contribution will accrue to Ireland only after all member states make their balancing payments, either this year or next.</p></reply>

However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. </p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. </p><p>  Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.</p><p>  A relief did exist in the form of a benefit-in-kind exemption, where childcare facilities were provided by an employer.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs.  To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.  While wanting to encourage participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less valuable contribution to society. </p><p>  In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax altogether.  It could also be argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  In considering these, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive generally provides that supplies of goods and services be chargeable to VAT at the standard rate but that lower rates are permitted in very limited circumstances.  Food products can only benefit from the zero rating in accordance with Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for "clearly defined social reasons" where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on and since 1 January 1991.</p><p>  As set out in the Revenue Commissioners' eBrief 70/2011, a range of food supplements and vitamins that encourage the maintenance of health, through the sustenance derived from a normal, healthy diet, benefit from the zero rate of VAT.  The key consideration is whether the food supplement is one that forms part of a person's normal diet for the purposes of sustenance as opposed to enhancing a person's diet with a view to achieving a particular aim.  A food supplement taken for the purposes of muscle growth or body mass increase, or for the purposes of weight reduction or bodily sculpture, cannot benefit from the zero rate since such products are not food.  The two supplements specified in the Parliamentary Question, probiotics and Glucosamine, could qualify as zero rated food supplements, or could be liable at the standard VAT rate, but there is insufficient information provided to make such a determination.  If the Deputy could provide more information on the food supplements in question, the Revenue Commissioners can advise on their correct VAT treatment as appropriate. </p><p>  I would also point out that food for the purposes of interpretation of the provisions of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 has the ordinary and everyday meaning of food.  Alternative definitions in other EU legislation are not relevant to the interpretation of food for VAT purposes.</p></reply>

While the Scheme provides for the repayment of excise duty on fuel used in the adapted vehicle, it does not provide for the relief of VAT paid in respect of the fuel used. </p><p>  I assume the Deputy is referring to the introduction of the new fuel grant scheme to replace the repayment of excise duty on fuel element of the Scheme.  In April 2013 the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the excise relief element of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme is incompatible with the EU Energy Tax Directive.  My Department has informed the European Commission of my intention to remove the excise relief element of the Scheme at the end of 2014 and replace it with a fuel grant in 2015.  The European Commission has raised no objections.</p><p>  To give effect to this I signed a statutory instrument in March of this year (S.I. 139 of 2014) with the effect that Regulation 16 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. 353 of 1994) would be revoked as of 1 January 2015.  As such, members of the Scheme may claim excise relief on any fuel used up to 31 December 2014.  From 1 January 2015, current and prospective members of the Scheme will be eligible for a fuel grant in respect of fuel used during the year. </p><p>  At this time, I intend to maintain the current practice of paying the sum a year in arrears, so that the first payment of the fuel grant would take place on 1 January 2016.  I have instructed my officials to design the new grant in such a way to provide as seamless a transition as possible between the excise relief on fuel element and the new fuel grant and, as I stated in March, members of the Scheme will not be at a loss in the transition.</p><p>  Officials from my Department are continuing to engage with other Departments and the Revenue Commissioners in order to put in place the legislative, administrative and financing changes necessary for the operation of the fuel grant.  I intend to notify members of the Scheme of the details of the new fuel grant as soon as all the details are finalised.</p></reply>

After the initial period of operations, the SBCI in conjunction with its funders, will review its funding requirements for its further development.</p><p>  The SBCI is working with its first lending partners to provide initial funding to the SME sector by the end of 2014.  A full roll-out will occur during January 2015 with traditional bank lenders and importantly new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector being involved.  All of this will allow for the distribution of SBCI funding to the SME sector in Ireland on a prudent basis.  The establishment of the SBCI will increase the range of SME  funding products such as loans with repayment holidays which will in turn drive demand from SMEs for this type of more suitable financing thereby increasing the size of the SME lending market.  The SBCI's lending partners must pass on the lower cost of the SBCI funding to their SME customers and will have to demonstrate this.  All lending partners have to demonstrate that all benefits are passed onto SMEs.  This is part of their terms and conditions with the SBCI and a feature of the State Aid approval for the operations of the SBCI.  The SBCI intends to offer its funding to partner lenders on a non-discriminatory basis to those lenders so that all lenders to SMEs receive the same lower cost of funding.  This ensures that SME customers are not penalised for using one finance provider over another.  The exact rates applicable have yet to be finalised and will depend to a certain extent on market conditions at the time when the funds are drawn from the SBCI.</p></reply>

The SBCI will take account of market conditions for SME financing as part of its operations.  If SMEs are having difficulty in particular sectors, the SBCI is mandated to design products which address any such difficulties.  In this way the SBCI can facilitate the provision of sufficient prudent finance to fund the commercial activities of SMEs throughout the economy.<br/><br/>Initially, the SBCI will facilitate the offering of financial products that can be used for both investment and working capital needs.  These products will be subject to <i>de minimis</i>state aid constraints.  Capital investment, for example, for the purchase of machinery will be for new investments.  The SBCI's working capital product provides greater certainty for firms managing their cashflow as it will be offered with a minimum commitment of two years.<br/><br/>In general SBCI funds should not be used for the refinancing of existing loans.  However, in the specific case of loans of banks that are exiting the Irish SME finance market, the SBCI is examining how it could provide funding to lending partners so that they might help SMEs facing the potential critical difficulty of having their finance withdrawn.<br/><br/>The legislation gives the SBCI a broad mandate to supply credit wherever firms experience problems in financing their activities, initially the SBCI will focus on SMEs regardless of their sector.  However, the SBCI's funders have some restrictions on the final destination of their loans.  For example, it was a precondition of KfW's financing that none of the &euro;150m forwarded would go towards speculation on property development.  Indeed, it is a general policy that the SBCI will not finance pure speculation in property.  It should be noted that businesses within the construction sector, such as electricians and plasterers for instance, can of course be funded.</p></reply>

It is the on-lenders who will assess the risk of the loan propositions from their customers. <br/><br/>The SBCI is based on a common and successful on-lending model that is used across Europe and further afield for example by Germany's KfW and Spain's ICO.  The on-lending model has many advantages over direct lending and is designed to ensure that as much of the benefit of the SBCI's lower funding cost is passed onto SMEs.  This helps the SBCI to maintain a lean operation and avoids as much operational overhead as possible.  Also, the SBCI can better deliver on one of its key goals i.e. that of diversifying the SME finance market by operating as an wholesale lender rather than entering the SME finance market directly.  The SBCI's focus is to facilitate the funding of new entrants to this market in order to expand the range and profile of SME lenders in Ireland.  As a result, enhanced sustainable competition in the SME finance market is very likely to improve the terms and conditions offered by finance providers to SMEs.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, Section 8 of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) Act 2014 mandates the SBCI to design credit facilities that meet the needs of SMEs.  The SBCI will take account of market conditions for SME financing as part of its operations.  If SMEs are having difficulty in particular sectors, the SBCI is mandated to design products which address any such difficulties.  In this way the SBCI can facilitate the provision of sufficient prudent finance to fund the commercial activities of SMEs throughout the economy. <br/><br/>All funding to SMEs from the SBCI will have to adhere to EU State aid rules.  SMEs in accepting an SBCI loan through a lending partner will be expected to confirm that the funding provided does not exceed its three year <i>de minimis</i>State Aid allowance. <br/><br/>Tax Clearance Certificates will not be required by the SBCI directly from SMEs and any possible conditions attaching to loans such as a loan-to-value ratio or personal guarantees are for the SBCI's lending partners to determine as part of their risk assessment criteria.  It is important to note that the SBCI's lending partners' hold the risk of the individual SME loans.</p></reply>

The legislation provides a mandate to the SBCI and a framework from in which it will operate.  Section 8 of the SBCI Act 2014 requires the SBCI to ensure that SMEs have sufficient prudent finance to fund their commercial activities and mandates the SBCI to design credit facilities that meet the needs of SMEs. </p><p>  While the Minister for Finance is the sole shareholder of the SBCI, the board of the corporation will act independently in fulfilling its duties in ensuring that SBCI has the entended effect on SME financing.  Therefore the Minister for Finance will not provide detailed guidelines on the way the funds of the SBCI will be provided.</p><p>  This arrangement will enable the SBCI to grow its balance sheet to a greater size than it would be if it were to be classed as a part of the Government debt.  Giving the SBCI its own independent mandate also makes it more likely can continue on a sustainable basis into the future and will be around to help SMEs both in the post crisis era and far into the future.</p></reply>

As announced in my Budget 2015 speech, Permanent tsb will shortly recommence actively lending to the SME sector, and has agreed to participate in the Credit Review Office process, with Ulster Bank actively considering making a similar commitment.  Both would be subject to a similar CRO appeal mechanism where they operate as SBCI onlenders.  It is important to note that the SBCI's lending partners hold the risk of the individual SME loans.</p><p>  The Credit Review Office will provide the lending partner with an opinion on whether it agrees with a rejected lending proposal or not.  The lending partner can then respond to this opinion and confirms the next steps in response to the recommendations set out by the Credit Review Office.  Where the Credit Review Office has upheld a lending partner's decision not to lend, the opinion will always seek to provide alternatives and guidance to the borrower to help the business move forward.</p></reply>

The child is considered to be in receipt of an annual gift from the parent throughout the term of the loan.  The value to the child of this gift is an amount equivalent to the income from the investment of an amount equal to the amount of the loan.  In practice, this is taken to be the amount that would be earned if the amount of the loan was invested at the best bank deposit rate obtainable in the open market on such a sum.</p><p>  If this annual value of the free use of a sum of cash (in effect the interest that would have been obtained had the money been placed on deposit) is below &euro;3,000 per annum, the gift each year is exempt from CAT under section 69 CATCA 2003-small gifts exemption- provided the donee has received no other gifts in that year from the same donor.</p><p>  If the annual value of the free use of cash exceeds &euro;3,000 per annum then only the excess each year is treated as a taxable gift.  However, it is important to note that no CAT becomes payable on any such gift until the total value of all taxable gifts and inheritances taken by the child from the parent exceeds &euro;225,000.</p><p>  To take an example, if the best bank deposit rate obtainable on a sum of &euro;40,000 was, say, 2%, the donee would be deemed to take a gift each year of &euro;800.  That deemed annual gift of &euro;800 is below the annual small gift exemption of &euro;3,000 and is therefore completely outside the scope of CAT, assuming the donee has taken no other gifts in that year from the same donor.</p><p>  If a parent makes a gift of &euro;40,000 to a child then &euro;37,000, being the amount in excess of the small gift exemption, is a taxable gift.  However, as already indicated no CAT becomes payable on any such gift until the total value of all taxable gifts and inheritances taken by the child from the parent exceeds &euro;225,000.</p><p>  The Deputy's reference to a sum being &quot;officially&quot; gifted to a child is not understood.  If there is some doubt about the true nature of a transaction, the Revenue Commissioners will have regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances in deciding the correct tax treatment of the transaction.</p></reply>

This judgement was made on the basis that the Commission's decision was not based on a full and formal investigation.</p><p>  The Deputy is aware that Ryanair lodged a State aid complaint with the Commission against the Air Travel Tax in 2009 and that subsequently, in July 2011, the Commission found that the use of a lower rate of tax for flights within 300 km of Dublin airport seemed to constitute State Aid.  The Commission dismissed Ryanair's claim that the non-application of the Air Travel Tax to transit and transfer passengers constituted a State Aid.  </p><p>  Ryanair appealed the Commission's findings, both in respect of the State Aid decision and the exemption for transit passengers, to the General Court in September 2011.  As already outlined, the General Court has now struck down the Commission's decision that the exemption of transfer and transit passengers from the Air Travel Tax did not constitute State aid.  This judgement does not come to any conclusion as to whether the exemption constituted state aid. Rather, the judgement was made on the basis that the Commission should have but did not initiate a formal investigation procedure in order to gather the necessary information and to allow all parties to present their observations in connection with that procedure.  </p><p>  The Commission may now conduct a formal investigation or appeal the judgment to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-02a.343.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120200060#WRH00600"><p>I note the opinion of the OECD that the revenue gains from higher economic growth should be used to accelerate the reduction of the debt ratio.  However, it is important to point out that, when framing a Budget, the Government does not just consider the fiscal position but also has to consider a number of other issues such as social cohesion and the need to safeguard the ongoing economic recovery. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that these benefits will be achieved while still meeting our budgetary targets under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).  In fact, we are targeting a deficit of 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2015, inside the 2.9 per cent target.  Indeed, I note that the OECD in its analysis of Ireland in the recently-published Economic Outlook is of the view that this EDP objective will be achieved in 2015, as a budget deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP is projected. </p><p>  As regards the need for further reforms, I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and acts as a disincentive for work and investment.  The income tax measures announced in the Budget will reduce the burden on working people while also securing the economic recovery that is under way.  As I outlined on Budget day, my Department estimates a three year reform plan along these lines could boost employment by as much as 15,000 jobs when the full impact of the changes has taken effect in the economy.  This will underpin the job creation already underway in the economy as evidenced by CSO data released last week which show that more than 80,000 people are at work in Ireland compared with the low point of mid-2012. </p><p>  This Government recognises the role that structural reforms can play in increasing the capacity of the economy to grow.  To this end, the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 contains several actions designed to increase competition and innovation and to support new business formation. </p><p>  For example, as regards the ease of starting and developing a business, entrepreneurship is one of the &quot;disruptive reforms&quot; included in the Action Plan for 2014.  In support of this, I announced a number of measures to support the SME sector in the Budget.  These included an increase in the amount of finance that can be raised by a company under the Employment and Investment Incentive to &euro;5 million annually subject to a lifetime maximum of &euro;15 million.  I also announced changes to the Foreign Earnings Deduction to support SMEs to grow their businesses abroad.  A range of other measures to support entrepreneurs including the roll-out of the Local Employment Offices (LEOs) are outlined in the Action Plan. </p><p>  The Action Plan also includes a range of actions in the area of innovation, focused on accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment, further strengthening enterprise engagement with public research and driving more commercialisation of publicly performed research.</p><p>  For all the actions planned for 2014 in these areas I refer the Deputy to the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p><p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the Scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the Vehicle Registration Tax and/or VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on fuel element of the Scheme. </p><p>  The Department of Finance conducted a review of Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme in 1993, which informed the drafting and enactment of the 1994 Regulations.  As part of the review, the position of single hand amputees was considered given extensive representations made seeking the inclusion of persons without the use of one arm or hand within the qualifying medical criteria.  The review noted that such a disability did not present as serious a challenge to mobility as the extant qualifying criteria, and on that basis, and in the context of limited resources, priority should be given to those citizens with the greatest challenge to their mobility.</p><p>  Unfortunately, the current context is still one of constrained resources.  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  However, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

One of the strategy action points provides for an examination of the issue of mortgage insurance and a consideration of how it might assist the provision of adequate and sustainable mortgage finance, on affordable terms, in particular to first time buyers.  Work on this issue is ongoing and it has and will continue to benefit from inputs by relevant Departments and bodies. </p><p>  However, there have also been some recent developments which will now need to be taken into account in the further advancement of this action point.  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank has published a Consultation Paper on the proposed macro prudential measures in relation to residential mortgage lending which raises the issue of mortgage insurance and asks if some adequately insured mortgages should be exempted from the proposed loan to value (LTV) limitations outlined in the consultation paper. </p><p>  As a separate initiative to further assist the evaluation and consideration of mortgage insurance, the Deputy and his colleagues on the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform are also undertaking an examination of mortgage insurance.  This is a very worthwhile and welcome development.  The committee is a most qualified and appropriate forum to conduct such an examination and it is particularly well placed to seek and obtain the views of the industry, consumer representatives and other interested parties, and then to evaluate these and to produce a report on this matter.  When that report becomes available, it will make a very important contribution to the ongoing public policy consideration of this significant issue.</p></reply>

No. 147 of 2013) as having &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot;.  These Regulations describe the methodology that must be used when a property is being assessed for pyrite damage.</p><p>  Unless and until the LPT legislation is changed, Revenue has an obligation to act in accordance with section 10A of the LPT legislation which requires that an LPT exemption can only apply where the residential property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued.  This is the only type of certificate that is relevant and a homeowner cannot claim the exemption until it has been issued.</p><p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the letter referred to by the Deputy was issued by Revenue in response to an email from the customer requesting clarification on the qualifying conditions for the exemption.  The letter clarified that the exemption can only be claimed for the property where the owner has received the relevant certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; from a competent person such as an engineer. Similar replies have issued to other customers who were querying the qualifying conditions for this exemption. </p><p>  I confirm that I am aware of the anomaly to which the Deputy refers, and that officials of my Department, together with officials of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, are examining the alternatives other than testing that may be available in order to confirm entitlement to a Local Property Tax (LPT) exemption.  I am conscious that the issue to which the Deputy refers needs to be addressed and I want to assure the Deputy, and those homeowners affected, that this issue is receiving attention.  </p><p>  I expect to make a decision in the matter shortly that will be consistent with the original objectives of the legislation and the report of the Pyrite Panel, and I will communicate my decision to the Deputy immediately it is made. </p><p>  It is important that any changes that may be made do not go beyond the objectives of providing a temporary exemption for homes with &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; only.  As I have advised on many occasions in the past, a liability to LPT should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate of the tax to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.</p></reply>

I understand that these mortgages are currently being serviced in line with those terms. </p><p>  Furthermore, the Department of Finance has prepared the Sale of Loan Books to Unregulated Third Parties Bill in order to address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears after the sale of loan books to unregulated entities.  Detailed engagement with the Attorney General's office and the Central Bank on draft legislation has commenced and in July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders.  Officials in my Department are carefully considering the submissions and it is anticipated that legislation will be published by the end of this year.</p><p>  The relevant code of conduct that can apply to certain business borrower lender relationships is the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME Code).  The application of the SME Code varies depending on whether the relevant purchasing entity of the commercial loans is a regulated entity or an unregulated entity. If the purchasing entity is a regulated entity, it is required to comply with the SME Code.  If the purchasing entity is not a regulated entity, it is not required to comply with the SME Code.</p><p>  In terms of context, unlike consumer lending, business lending is not an activity which, in and of itself, must be undertaken by a regulated entity i.e. an unregulated entity could be established for the sole purpose of lending to SMEs and this would not require authorisation, and would not be subject to any legislation or codes.</p><p>  It is also important to note that the sale of these loans does not change the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in any way.  Irrespective of who acquires the loan(s) they will be required to honour the legal terms and conditions of the existing loan agreement(s).</p></reply>

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  </p><p>  At present, certain child care and pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates under the terms of paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, where the organisation is a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of &quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001. Similarly, certain pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates where  the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met.  </p><p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates of child care and early education facilities was raised at Committee Stage of the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad with Minister of State Simon Harris, who was taking the Bill through the Seanad on my behalf. He undertook to consider what could be done in this regard. As a result, I got Government approval for a Seanad Report Stage amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis. This amendment was proposed and passed at Report Stage in the Seanad on 20th November 2014. I intend that the Bill will be considered by the D&aacute;il shortly. </p><p>  The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early child care and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in the Seanad, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. It is immaterial to the valuation of a property whether the occupier of a property, particularly an occupier that can make a profit, provides a service to the State or provides a service with the support of the State. There are a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding.  </p></reply>

The Exchequer capital programme for the next three years has been set at &euro;10 billion.  This will represent significant continued Exchequer investment in the maintenance of valuable infrastructure and the creation of new assets.I am very keen that we look at how we can use private sector funding to supplement our Exchequer investment. As the Deputy will be aware, PPPs have been used in Ireland for over a decade. The main driver for the pursuit of PPPs in Ireland has been the achievement of a value for money (VfM) solution for the Exchequer rather than the achievement of a particular balance sheet status. The Irish government has put in place a number of VfM initiatives designed to secure value in the procurement of all public investment projects including PPPs. In addition to these measures, PPPs are also subject to four specific VfM tests throughout the procurement process in order to determine whether the PPP approach has the potential to deliver a VfM solution.The Deputy will also be aware that we are setting up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. The ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise the resources transferred from the NPRF by attracting third-party co-investment. In this way, the Fund's assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy.</p><p>  On Budget Day I announced a significant capital investment of some &euro;2.2bn in social housing. This is comprised of &euro;1.5 billion direct Exchequer investment, a &euro;300m PPP investment and at least &euro;400m investment in Approved Housing Bodies through an off-balance sheet financial vehicle. The use of off balance sheet funding mechanisms has allowed us to increase the overall level of funding available for this priority area and thereby begin to address a critical need.</p></reply>

In relation to companies that are supported by Enterprise Ireland, I am informed by that agency that it has recently decided to invest in a company which it met at the summit three years ago.  Additionally the agency continues to be in discussion with other companies which it met at previous summits. Details of the investment and the companies have not yet been announced, and I&rsquo;m sure that the Deputy will appreciate that it would inappropriate for me to go into further details at this stage. </p><p>  Suffice to say, however that there is often a long lead in time between initial contacts by the enterprise development agencies and the coming to fruition of a project. As the web summits have grown in size future relocations and referrals are expected to grow. I have no doubt that the contacts made at this years and previous year&rsquo;s web summits will continue to lead to jobs growth and investment in the years ahead.   </p></reply>

The mandate was adopted by the EU Council of Ministers on 14 June, 2013. The text of the mandate is available on the EU Council&rsquo;s website. <i>.</i><br/><br/>Paragraphs 22 and 23 of the mandate set out the parameters of the negotiating mandate insofar as investment protection including investor state dispute settlement are concerned. <br/><br/>The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date. <br/><br/>The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection and investor-to-state dispute settlement will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement. Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner. <br/><br/>I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that I believe that ISDS is a valid mechanism<b><i>.</i></b>But I also believe that the experience of ISDS internationally has given rise to concerns and shows us there is room for much improvement in how the system works. <br/><br/>The EU Commission earlier this year decided to conduct a formal public consultation on ISDS in TTIP, and negotiations on ISDS under TTIP have been suspended since then. The formal consultation closed in July, and the EU Commission is now examining the submissions received. The EU Commission&rsquo;s preliminary report can be found at: <br/><br/><i>.</i><br/><br/>Ireland was one of a number of EU member states that wrote to the new EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecelia Malmstrom, expressing the view that the consultation was an important step in ensuring that we strike the correct balance to ensure that governments retain their full freedom to regulate. We also pointed out that it would be important that the outcome of this consultation would run its course and that the views expressed by our stakeholders would be carefully considered before reaching firm decisions on the way forward.</p></reply>

According to the CSO Quarterly Earnings and Labour Costs release of 25th November 2014, average weekly paid hours increased by 0.3% over the Quarter and by 0.6% over the year.    There was a fall in average weekly earnings of -1.9 % over the Quarter and by -0.8 % over the year. Across the economic sectors, weekly earnings increased in 6 of the 13 sectors, most notably in Industry (+3.4%), Construction (+0.2%), in Wholesale and Retail trades (+1.6%) and in the Transportation and Storage (+0.2%), which combined account for 710,000 of those at work. The largest percentage sectoral decrease was recorded in the Professional, Scientific and Technical activities sector, which fell by -5.3%. At the same time, this economic sector experienced one of the largest quarterly employment increases in the latest QNHS - an increase of +5%. It may be that this additional employment comprised newer entrants with relatively lower entrant earnings levels and that this has contributed to the lowering of the average weekly earnings levels in this economic sector. It will require analysis of a number of further QNHS releases to clarify this. In itself therefore, this decrease in average earnings may partially the result of a positive employment recruitment trend. </p><p>  The Government is undertaking a number of initiatives to sustain and grow living standards. Following measures introduced in Budget 2015, from January 2015 the standard rate tax band will increase by &euro;1,000: from &euro;32,800 to &euro;33,800 for single people and from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800 for married couples with one income. The higher rate of income tax will reduce from 41% to 40%.  The Budget also reduced the two lower rates of USC from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively. And increased the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC. </p><p>  The national minimum wage in Ireland is considered to be relatively high by international standards. The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fourth highest among the 21 EU member states that have a national minimum wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest.  The decision to restore the national minimum wage to &euro;8.65 per hour, after the cut by the previous Government, with effect from 1 July 2011, together with the decision to put the joint labour committees, JLC, system on a more secure legal and constitutional footing and reinstate a robust system of protection, represents a significant commitment by this Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers. </p><p>  In addition to Ireland's national minimum wage, JLC and REA structures, we have a system of supports through the Department of Social Protection supporting low income families. </p><p>  The Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 contains a commitment to establish a low pay commission on a statutory basis as an independent body to make annual recommendations to the Government about the appropriate level of the national minimum wage and related matters. I am currently developing proposals to implement that commitment. </p><p>  However, as noted above, it is the creation of employment that offers the greatest potential to enhance our living standards.  Implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the development of the 2015 plan are critical in this regard. </p></reply>

I am aware that, in a statement issued in November 2013, the Deputy put the annual value of the gift card industry at &euro;250 million, but I do not know the basis for this estimate. The figure is clearly substantial, however, given that a survey of over 1,000 consumers undertaken for the National Consumer Agency in November 2013 found that around half of consumers planned to purchase gift vouchers or cards as Christmas presents that year and that the average intended spend per consumer on these products was &euro;174.  Though there are no specific legislative provisions governing gift cards and vouchers, businesses supplying these products are subject to general consumer protection legislation. <br/><br/>The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 27 of 1995) provide protections for consumers against any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated and which causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer. The Consumer Protection Act 2007 protects consumers from unfair, misleading or aggressive commercial practices by traders, such as false or misleading information about the terms of use or date of expiry of gift vouchers. The European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013) impose an extensive range of information obligations on traders who sell gift cards or vouchers, whether on an on-premises, off-premises or distance basis. <br/><br/>The Regulations also give consumers who conclude contracts for the purchase of gift cards or vouchers on an off-premises or distance basis the right to cancel the contract within fourteen days of its conclusion. This right may not apply, however, to gift cards and vouchers for non-residential accommodation and catering and leisure services where the contract provides for a specific date or period of performance.<br/><br/>In view of the maximum harmonisation nature of Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices, it would not be possible to introduce legislative provisions regulating the expiry date or other terms and conditions<i></i>of gift vouchers within the framework of unfair commercial practices law as given effect in the Consumer Protection Act 2007. <br/><br/>Though such regulation may be possible within the framework of the legislation on unfair terms in consumer contacts, a number of issues around such regulation require consideration and clarification. My Department is currently reviewing this legislation as part of a wider review of consumer contract rights law, and I have asked that possible provisions to regulate the expiry date and other terms and conditions of gift cards and vouchers be examined as part of this review.</p></reply>

The Bill is expected to be enacted by the end of 2014 with commencement from the 1st June 2015.    The main changes contained in the Companies Bill, 2012 are:</p><p>- The private company limited by shares (LTD) will have the same legal capacity as a natural person. </p><p>- The LTD will be allowed to have only one director. </p><p>- The LTD will have a single-document constitution.   </p><p>- The LTD will no longer be obliged to go through the formality of holding a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; Annual General Meeting (AGM) whereby all of the members have to convene in one location at the same time once each year. The Bill allows the members to instead hold a &ldquo;written&rdquo; AGM, whereby all of the matters which must be dealt with at the AGM can be approved by written procedure.</p><p>- Directors' duties are codified in the Bill, thereby making the law in this area more transparent and accessible. Currently many of the legal and equitable duties of directors are set out over more the 150 years of case law.</p><p>- The Bill provides for a &ldquo;summary approval procedure&rdquo;, which will be applicable to a number of activities (for example, reduction of capital) which under the current law might require the company to undertake the burdensome and expensive process of securing Court approval. The new &ldquo;summary approval procedure&rdquo; incorporates safeguards in relation to directors&rsquo; liability in circumstances where the procedure is used without proper justification.   </p><p>- The Bill contains a qualification regime for liquidators. In general, this will require liquidators to be a member of a prescribed accountancy body, or of the Law Society, or of any other body recognised for this purpose by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), or to be approved individually by IAASA pursuant to the transition (or &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo;) provision, based on the individual&rsquo;s experience and expertise. Liquidators will now also be required to hold appropriate professional indemnity cover. This qualification regime will also be extended to examiners under the Bill.</p><p>- All offences under company law have been streamlined under a new classification procedure which operates on the basis of four categories of offences, with Category 1 being the most serious. This will bring a structure and consistency to the offence provisions throughout the legislation.</p><p>- It will be possible to merge two Irish private companies. The procedure for this is modelled on the EU Cross-Border Merger Regulations, which are regarded as relatively straightforward to operate by the business and advisory community.</p><p>- Each company type (other than the private company limited by shares, which is dealt with in Parts 1 to 15) will have its own dedicated Part of the Bill. Each of these Parts will apply, disapply or vary the default provisions as set out in Parts 1 to 15, so as to tailor the application of the law for each other type of company.</p><p>- The company types which will each have their own dedicated Part, following this structure, are as follows &ndash; designated activity companies (Part 16), PLCs (Part 17), guarantee companies (Part 18), unlimited companies (Part 19), external companies (Part 21), unregistered companies (Part 22), and investment companies (Part 24).</p><p>- Part 18 extends the availability of the audit exemption to guarantee companies, on the same basis as this is available to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; trading companies (private companies limited by shares). However, any one member of a guarantee company can object to the audit exemption being availed of, and in these circumstances the company will be required to proceed with an audit.</p><p>- Part 20 contains provisions which will enable a company to convert from any company type (for example, a private company limited by shares) to any other company type (for example, a PLC), subject to complying with the requirements for the company type to which it wishes to convert.</p><p>- Part 21 contains a streamlined regime for external companies operating in Ireland. The previous &ldquo;place of business&rdquo; concept from the Companies Act 1963, which was problematic in certain respects in its operation, is not being carried forward in the Bill. All external companies will now have the single option of registering as a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; in Ireland, which is a concept under EU law (and which Ireland is accordingly obliged to provide for) and which offers greater clarity and structure.</p><p>- Part 23 contains the provisions that apply to companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, including provisions in relation to what is known as &ldquo;Markets law&rdquo;.  This includes provisions dealing with public offers of securities (including prospectus law), market abuse law, corporate governance statements for traded companies, and transparency law. These provisions are largely based on EU requirements in these respective areas.-	Part 24 contains the provisions relevant to investment funds companies, which were previously set out predominantly in Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990. These have now been consolidated, with appropriate subsequent provisions from the 2005, 2006 and 2009 Acts in this Part. </p></reply>

An application has also been received from the herdowner concerned under the Hardship Grant Scheme which is designed to alleviate the additional feed costs incurred by eligible owner(s) whose holdings are restricted during the period from the 1 November to 30 April. An essential condition of the Scheme is that the holding continues to be restricted following a full herd re-test (normally scheduled 60 days after removal of reactors) and the Grant is not payable for the intervening period. In this case, the reactor re-test is due to be done between 13 and 27 December 2014 and eligibility of the applicant, taking account of all relevant criteria, will be assessed by the Department&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Office at that time. </p></reply>

All six Fishery Centres are first and foremost working fishery harbours.  However each centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both and economic and social perspective.     </p><p>  All of the Fishery Harbour Centres contain marine repair facilities provided by the Department however the synchrolift repair facility in Dunmore East is not currently operational due to the siltation problem in that harbour.  In addition, private companies operating from premises in Howth, Castletownbere and Killybegs also provide marine repair services. </p><p>  Properties located in the Fishery Harbour Centres, including Howth, are made available for tenancy under the relevant Government Procedures in place covering the management of State property.  When appropriate, sites and properties are offered for tenancy under lease agreement by means of an open competitive tendering process in accordance with good practice and public procurement guidelines.  In 2013, my Department held public competitive tendering processes for vacant sites in three Fishery Harbour Centres including Howth.  These tender processes were open to all interested parties on an equal basis.  The property in Howth was among the properties successfully tendered in this round. </p><p>  Plans with regard to potential future uses for vacant properties at the Fishery Harbour Centres are kept under ongoing review by my Department.  Consideration is given to demand for particular services should such demands become apparent, subject to public procurement guidelines as set out by Government.  The current situation in relation to Howth is that there are some sites and properties not in use.  A number of these on the East Pier would never be viable for commercial enterprise and others are subject to structural repair and other pre-tendering preparation issues before they can be made available.   </p><p>  There have been expressions of interest from individuals for a number of activities including a marine repair service.  Where requested, interested parties have been met and the Government procedures for the disposal of State Property have been explained to these parties.  Individuals who expressed an interest will be in a position to tender for the sites that become available in 2015.   </p></reply>

A variety of reasons have led to a problem with under-grazing, including the introduction of decoupled payments under the SPS in 2005, the requirement to destock in certain areas for environmental reasons and the age profile of farmers with commonage land.  It is a complex issue with no single dominant factor.  This trend is not good for the environment, as these areas lose the specific characteristics as natural habitats for flora and fauna.  In addition, the creeping ineligibility of these lands under the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission.  Under the reformed CAP Regime, it was decided that Direct Payments should be more focused on active farmers.  Discussions are currently underway with the EU Commission on these matters.</p></reply>

At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are clearly informed of the need to carefully examine each map and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes, etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers.  Where letters issue as a result of ineligible areas having been identified, considerable detail regarding the issues, and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, are provided.  Where possible, payments continue to issue.  In addition, farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should they disagree with the findings of my Department.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided to my Department.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome of that review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee.</p><p>  To date, some 10,728 appeals have been received, of which 8,448 have been finalised or are in the final stages of processing.  In addition, 2,280 cases are in the process of either ground verification visits or administrative validation.  To date, 359 cases were referred to the Land Eligibility Appeals Committee for consideration.  These cases were reviewed by the Appeals Committee and decisions have been advised to 319 of the applicants.</p></reply>

The Intrastat system has two components.  Firstly, the Intrastat survey (conducted by the Revenue Commissioners), in which traders, above the Intrastat survey trade thresholds, make detailed monthly returns giving information on the quantity and value of all exports to or imports from EU countries.  The second component is the regular VAT return, on which all traders are required to record the total value of goods imported from and exported to other EU countries.  This information provides the basis for determining total EU trade for those traders below the Intrastat survey thresholds and is also used to maintain the register of EU traders.  The Bord Bia Export Performance and Prospects published in January 2014 included an estimated value of &euro;2.1 billion for beef exports in 2013.  Their current estimate based on updated information is &euro;2.045 billion.  The method used by Bord Bia is based on using production data, import figures and consumption data to derive an estimate of beef available for export, and then applying to the beef carcase weight equivalent the percentage change in average cattle prices reported to my Department.  It has not changed in recent years.</p><p>  Bord Bia has been in regular contact with the Central Statistics Office and discussions with a view to aligning the methodologies used more closely will continue.</p></reply>

Westmeath, and that the company&rsquo;s local Forest Operations Manager had arranged for the land to be surveyed on 6<sup>th</sup>October 2014.<br/><br/>I note that Coillte responded to the Deputy&rsquo;s correspondence by letter of 14<sup>th</sup>October 2014, in which the company advised that the lands had been surveyed by the company&rsquo;s engineer on 6<sup>th</sup>October 2014 to investigate the drainage issue further with the letter then conveying his findings.  I also note that Coillte advised that it will, as suggested by the Deputy, employ a contractor in order to remove the silt, fallen leaves and other debris and manage the maintenance works associated with cleaning the drain.  I understand that Coillte has concerns, however, that these remedial works may not resolve the drainage issue for the private landowner but will only allow the over flow water to run off.  The company advised that if the owner of the lands in question would like to discuss this further, Coillte are happy for him to contact the local team in the area.<br/><br/>I trust the Deputy received the response of 14<sup>th</sup>October 2014.

There are three anti-malarial medications licensed by the HPRA , in use in the Defence Forces, namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline.The malaria chemoprophylactic agent of choice for use in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be Lariam. <br/><br/>The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. The choice of medication for the particular mission in Sierra Leone is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. Lariam requires a &ldquo;lead in&rdquo; time of approximately four weeks before deployment. However, if there exists an operational imperative which requires &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; deployment i.e. (deployment within less than a week) Doxycycline may be used. If the deployment duration was less than four weeks Malarone may be used. The malaria chemoprophylactic agent used for Sierra Leone is in keeping with this guidance.<br/><br/>Former Ministers for Defence have had the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam investigated thoroughly and obtained the advice of leading medical experts, who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. Anti-malarial medications must remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  In addition, two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services will be created.</p><p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. </p><p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012 and which includes a recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to introduce such an offence.  I have met with representatives from both sides of the debate, including those working in the industry, and my Department has received numerous representations expressing views from both sides.</p><p>  I am satisfied that it is necessary to take steps to tackle the trafficking and wider exploitation of persons through prostitution.  Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution.</p><p>  My Department will continue to provide help and assistance to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation including those seeking to leave prostitution.  In 2014, the Department of Justice and Equality allocated &euro;172,000 to Ruhama, an NGO working with women in prostitution and those exiting prostitution, in order to support Ruhama's work in assisting women victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Support services to suspected victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, including those in prostitution, are provided by the Reception and Integration Agency, the Human Trafficking Team of the HSE, the Legal Aid Board and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to accommodation; medical care and planning; psychological assistance; material assistance; legal aid and advice; accessing the labour market and vocational training, personal security; translation and interpretation services; etc.  The Women's Health Service of the HSE also provides medical and other support services to women in prostitution and exiting prostitution.  </p><p>  In terms of the specific question concerning the trafficking of persons for prostitution and sexual exploitation, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.   It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and/or a fine.</p></reply>

The cost of naturalisation is not easily comparable across jurisdictions as the range of fees, fee structures and concessions available are diverse.  Some countries charge relatively small amounts during the naturalisation process but make acquiring the required residence to apply for naturalisation very costly. Some countries charge both local and federal naturalisation fees that can bring the cost to more than twice that in the State. Naturalisation costs in the UK are higher than those in the State and significantly higher for some categories of applicant. The headline accompanying the joint statement is therefore misleading as the cost to naturalise in the State is not the highest in the world nor is it anywhere close to being the highest. It is notable that the volume of applications for a certificate of naturalisation increased by over 50% in 2011, the year that the application fee was introduced, and increased further in 2012. In relation to encouraging democratic participation, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has been pro-active in this area and a leaflet informing new citizens of their right to register and vote in all elections in the State and how to register has been included in all ceremony packs since 20 May 2013. </p><p>  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 set out the prescribed fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation.  An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.</p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation. </p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.</p><p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.  However, there are no plans to reduce or abolish these fees.</p></reply>

A significant level of activity is taking place in pursuit of this commitment. <br/><br/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has a cross-Departmental mandate to develop, lead and co-ordinate migrant integration policy across other Government Departments, agencies and services.  The Office is currently engaged in a review of our approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation of a new updated overall integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants.  A Cross Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March, 2014 to this end with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders.  A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review.  Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross Departmental Group on Integration.  The Cross Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism.  Work on the development of the updated integration strategy is ongoing and will continue into 2015 when a draft strategy will be published and observations invited from key stakeholders before finalisation.  <br/><br/>In light of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, 90 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict and who had taken refuge in the Lebanon and Jordan were selected for admission to Ireland under a UNHCR resettlement programme by the resettlement team of the Office.  Seventy eight of the refugees have arrived to date and have been resettled.  This figure includes three serious medical cases (including two children) and their families, who are receiving appropriate medical treatment.  A further twelve refugees will arrive in December. In 2015, 100 refugees will be admitted, the majority from Syria. The resettlement team also continue to work with programme refugees admitted under previous years programmes.<br/><br/>The Office also continues to monitor the prevalence of racist incidents and publishes information in this regard on its website.  Other ongoing work is the provision of integration related material via the Office website and circulation lists, dealing with international reporting obligations and representation at integration related national and international fora.  The Office provides funding for the promotion of integration to some local authorities and national sports and other organisations.  It also administers EU funding for this purpose.  This work will continue on 2015.</p></reply>

Up to then, when a person was disqualified by a court, they had to send/hand their driving licence into the court office. The disqualification was physically marked on the licence which was then sent to the relevant motor tax office where it was held until the period of disqualification was completed or the licence was restored by the court.</p><p>  From January 2013, the person was required to send the licence directly to the licensing authority. This coincided with the introduction of the new card type driving licences on which details of a disqualification could not physically be entered. The fines notice which now issues to the person who was fined and disqualified includes the following &quot;Please forward your driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service, PO Box 858, Southside Delivery Office, Cork for the purpose of having the particulars of the conviction of disqualification of the District Court endorsed on your driver record&quot;.</p><p>  As the Courts Service no longer has a role in relation to the surrender of a licence by the disqualified driver no records are maintained in this regard.  In relation to the role of the Road Safety Authority in this regard, I understand that my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Report of this Working Group was published on 13 November and submissions<b></b>on the Report have been sought from stakeholders and<b></b>the public  by 31 January 2015.  The consultation process gives individuals and groups an opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation.<br/><br/>I have already given a commitment that I will not make any decisions until I have had the opportunity to consider all the submissions which are made and I meet the key stakeholders, including the organisations who represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes. I would now urge all concerned to engage with this process so that the views of all concerned can be considered before decisions are made in relation to this matter.<br/><br/>In so far as a risk assessment is concerned, the Firearms Licensing Review report has regard to recent relevant EU Commission reports and developments in other jurisdictions in relation to public safety.  A regulatory impact assessment will, of course, be conducted if there are any legislative proposals under consideration arising from the consultation process.<br/><br/>I do not consider that the statistics quoted by the Deputy undermine any of the arguments put forward in the review.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also advised that between 2009 and 2013 there were 96 murders and one case of manslaughter recorded in which firearms were used. </p><p>  In many such cases it is impossible to say (due to the fact that the firearm is often not recovered) whether the firearms used were firearms that had been licensed and subsequently stolen from their owners or whether the firearms were never in fact licensed.  A total of 1,134 firearms have been reported stolen from their owners in the period 2010 to 2013 inclusive, of which 355 were stolen in 2013.  A further 159 firearms have been reported lost in the same four year period, 53 of which were reported lost in 2013.  The concerns of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also based in part on a forward looking assessment of the dangers of an atrocity being carried out with weapons primarily designed to kill human beings, as has unfortunately happened in other jurisdictions.&quot;</p><p>  I think it is fair to say that this text from the report - which is based on information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - does not impugn law-abiding owners of licensed firearms in any way.</p></reply>

In addition, there have been a number of judicial review cases in this area in the context of persons whose applications for firearms licences have been refused.</p><p>  The licensing of firearms is a Garda operational matter and each application is judged on its own individual merits and the decision on whether, or not, to grant a firearm certificate rests solely with the issuing person.  The decision of the issuing person cannot be fettered in any way and I have no role in the matter.  My paramount concern in this area is public safety. As the Deputy is aware, in light of public safety concerns highlighted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and difficulties in the interpretation of the legislation expressed by members of the judiciary, a joint Department of Justice and Equality / An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Working Group was established to review firearms licensing. The Report of this Working Group was published on 13 November and submissions on the Report have been sought from stakeholders and the public.  The deadline for receipt of submissions is the 31st  of January 2015.</p><p>  The consultation process gives individuals and groups an opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation.  I have already given a commitment that I will not make any final decisions until I have had the opportunity to consider all the submissions which are made and I have met the key stakeholders, including the organisations who represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes. I would now urge all concerned to engage with this process so that the views of all concerned can be considered before final decisions are made in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

I met with the group in question on 5th November last and am aware of their concerns.</p><p>  I am aware of the sustainability issues faced by early years services and, over the coming period, I will be examining the options for future childcare investment.  </p><p>  Annual funding in the region of &euro;260 million is provided to the childcare sector to support a number of childcare programmes that are implemented by this Department. These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and a number of labour activation initiatives under the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes.  These programmes, in particular the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, provide a guaranteed source of income to participating services and, given that many parents would otherwise not be able to avail of pre-school care and education for their children, the funding has ensured that many childcare services, both commercial and community, have the resources to continue to operate.  </p><p>  Despite the budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years the Government has maintained the funding necessary to support these childcare programmes and has introduced new initiatives to meet the changing circumstances, particularly in regard to the improved employment opportunities in the economy.  As additional funding becomes available, I would hope that the capitation rates for all programmes could be increased to provide further support. </p><p>  I acknowledge that over previous years there have been delays in payments made to service providers, which may have resulted in further financial pressures at given times. This has been due to the fact that the programmes have undergone considerable changes to meet the changing childcare needs.  New programmes to support training and labour market activation measures have been introduced and, because these programmes have been administered separately and manually on separate databases, there have been issues in relation to duplication of effort and data exchange.  </p><p>  In recognition of these issues my Department and Pobal are in the process of introducing a new management platform for the early years programmes &ndash; the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP).  This new online system will streamline the administrative processes across childcare funding programmes.  It is envisaged that PIP will reduce paper-based exchanges of information between parties by the provision of online forms for data entry and integrated document management capabilities. This in turn will shorten the lead in time for key programme milestones, for example, the contracting period, initial payments, funding approval and subsequent payments. </p><p>  The introduction of new ICT infrastructure tends to result in minor technical issues emerging and PIP, a complex system, has been no exception, resulting in service providers experiencing delays in registering children on the system. Advance payments were made to service providers for both the ECCE and CCS programmes. </p><p>  On the 15th of October this year, while over 30,000 children had already been registered on the system for the ECCE programme, my Department took the decision to issue a further advance payment to service providers to allow for those service providers who had experienced delays or difficulties in completing their registrations. While acknowledging the inconvenience for service providers not receiving accurate balancing payments as early as usual, the decision was taken to ensure that all service providers received sufficient advance funding to honour any financial commitments, rather than to delay all payments until the PIP technical issues were resolved.  Providers were entitled to apply for an additional advance payment if they had significantly more children registered on the programme than last year.  </p><p>  ECCE balancing payments covering the period up to 23rd January 2015 are being made this week.  These payments are based on the actual numbers of children registered and approved for participation in the programme.</p><p>  The PIP technical issues also affected payments under the Training and Employment Childcare programmes.  These issues have also been resolved and there should be no delays in payments in the future. </p><p>  CCS Registrations on the PIP system are being launched this week. CCS service providers have also received a further preliminary payment, covering the period up to the end of January 2015, while CCS eligibility criteria is validated.</p><p>  The new ICT system is expected to further streamline the payment process for all of the childcare support programmes implemented by this Department. I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and Pobal are working to address issues as PIP develops, and I am confident that once the system is fully operational it will prove to be extremely beneficial and efficient and will significantly improve the situation for service providers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-02a.768.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120200069#WRR00700"><p>The introduction of a tax credit scheme is a matter for Government and the Minister for Finance in the first instance.</p><p>  I am aware of the relatively high cost of childcare in this country and of the difficulties that this presents, particularly where both parents are in employment outside of the home.  To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.</p><p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents who incur childcare costs was considered prior to the introduction of the targeted childcare supports which are now in place.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for childcare.  This approach would not benefit parents working in the home and could, therefore, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Tax reliefs would favour the higher-paid, and those on the minimum wage or in part-time work would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare requirements and may not be in a position to obtain receipts, making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to tax relief.  There is also a view that the introduction of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.</p><p>  I consider that direct investment in childcare provision would be a fairer way of supporting parents who require childcare support. I am aware that, despite the substantial Government investment, the issue of childcare costs remains a significant  concern for many parents throughout the country.  Increasing the State supports provided to help parents with these costs would require a considerable level of funding which will be considered in future Budgets.  These are matters I will be exploring in detail over the coming period.</p></reply>

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br/><br/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The implementation of the actions contained in the Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.  My Department and I will be keeping this commitment under review in the context of the progress of the Early Years Quality Agenda.</p></reply>

This programme aims to support pupils in developing a range of generic skills such as communicating, making decisions, knowing where to find reliable data, handling conflict constructively, and expressing feelings and emotions, which will enable them to deal appropriately with the different challenges they may face inside or outside of school. <br/><br/>The SPHE programme is also complemented by aspects of the Physical Education (P.E.) programme, which is implemented in all schools, as well as a range of initiatives that are designed to promote physical activity among pupils in schools. These include the Active Schools Flag which is funded by the Department of Education and Skills and supported by the Department of Health. <br/><br/>In order to build on previous experience and foster greater co-operation in the implementation across Government departments of&rsquo; policies on health promotion in the school setting, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, with the Health Service Executive and the Professional Development Service for Teachers have established a Health and Wellbeing Steering Group to develop collaboration as a means of enriching and enhancing the health and wellbeing of children and young people in the school setting.  Both service strands bring different and complementary knowledge and understandings about the needs of children and young people and strategies to address these.</p></reply>

However the HSE, subject to available funding, under the Treatment Abroad Scheme Travel Policy, may provide assistance towards reasonable economic air or sea travel fares for patients, and a travelling companion where appropriate or where the referring consultant identifies a necessity. Expenses other than air/sea fares are not admissible.  However, patients who experience difficulty funding any additional costs may apply to the Department of Social Protection for assistance as an exceptional needs payment.</p><p>  I understand the individual to whom the Deputy has referred has received appropriate assistance with his flight costs when accompanying a patient for treatment abroad. This was in line with the Treatment Abroad Scheme Travel Policy. Any further claim for subsistence cannot be met as it is not provided for under the Scheme.</p><p>  On 12 November I introduced a scheme for the reimbursement of some expenses of living kidney donors which applies to living donor transplants in Ireland and to those who, under clinical supervision, of the Renal Transplant Programme in Beaumont Hospital, travel to the UK for paired kidney donation.

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.</p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.</p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  </p><p>  The Minister for Health continues to monitor the situation closely and has asked NMBI and the staff associations to continue these discussions in order to seek a satisfactory resolution in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care. </p></reply>

The Health Act 2007 does not provide for the registration of a specific function (dementia care) for any centre.<br/><br/>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) published the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland </i>in 2009. HIQA commenced the revision of these Standards in 2013 after the first three-year cycle of registering and inspecting designated centres for older people. The revised draft <i>National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People</i>incorporates the learning from HIQA&rsquo;s inspection and registration of designated centres for older people since 2009.<br/><br/>It is estimated that over 80% of residents in designated centres have some degree of cognitive impairment and all designated centres should therefore meet standards appropriate for people with dementia in a way that meets the assessed needs of each individual. Supplementary criteria to cater for people with dementia are thus not necessary. <br/><br/>HIQA convened a Standards Advisory Group for Older People during the revision of the standards, which had representation from advocacy groups for older people, service providers, academia and Government agencies.<br/><br/>HIQA also undertook a five-week targeted consultation with members of the Standards Advisory Group and their representative organisations. Further opportunities were provided to all stake-holders and interest groups to provide feedback during an eight-week public consultation that HIQA conducted on the revised draft National Standards<i>. </i>Focus groups were carried out with residents living in designated centres (including those with cognitive impairments and dementia) during the revision process, with relatives of residents living in designated centres and with staff working in designated centres. <br/><br/>In 2015, HIQA will carry out a programme of thematic inspections which will focus on dementia. The thematic inspections in dementia care will aim to provide assurance that the centres inspected are continually improving the level of dementia care provided to residents. HIQA will provide service providers with further guidance as part of the improvement focus following these thematic inspections.<br/><br/>HIQA already engages with stake-holders including the general public, persons who use services, service providers and advocacy groups about matters relating to its statutory remit. Individuals or organisations who may wish to discuss matters pertaining to the Authority&rsquo;s remit should contact HIQA directly. </p></reply>

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met the three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme. The Scheme is supported by two of the three groups.  <br/><br/>Judge Maureen Harding Clark, retired High Court Judge has been appointed as independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual. <br/><br/>The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.<br/><br/>Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes and for the Nursing Home Support Scheme. <br/><br/>It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.<br/><br/>Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme, which are available on the Scheme&rsquo;s website. <br/><br/>Judge Clark reported that by last Friday, 28 November more than 140 women had applied for awards under the Scheme and to date conditional offers have been made totalling &euro;1,450,000.  There are 4 working days left to apply, including today and I would urge every eligible woman or her representative to submit her application within the appointed timeframe.<b></b>My Department will be making payments in the case of 7 women shortly and others should have payments before Christmas. <br/><br/>The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<br/><br/>Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families. </p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and often on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p><p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Eculizumab in the community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.</p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the  NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab and concluded that, at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33 million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting. In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy. Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes. The report is available on the NCPE's website.</p><p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by the pharmaceutical company, Alexion Pharma.   The HSE has been engaging with Alexion for some time to arrive at a pricing point that would assist it in its efforts to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible. The HSE met the company again in November and is currently considering the outcome of that engagement.  It is worth noting that the current Irish list price of &euro;4,557.50 per vial substantially exceeds the list price in the UK (&pound;3,150 sterling).</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug. While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should re-imburse every licensed medicine for whatever price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we re-imburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups. European Council Directive 98/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland.  In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population.</p><p>  A number of studies which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health in 2011.  They were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels.</p><p>  The most recent study on this topic reviewed by the Expert Body was the paper on 'Community Water Fluoridation and Intelligence: Prospective Study in New Zealand (Broadbent et al 2014).  Broadbent et al state that 'findings do not support the assertion that fluoride exposure in the context of CWF (Community Water Fluoridation) can affect neurologic development or IQ&quot;.  The study suggests that study members who lived in areas with CWF before age 5 years had slightly higher IQ's (on average) in adulthood than those who had not, although the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  This review is due to be completed by the end of  this year. </p></reply>

Under these Regulations, the HSE must apply charges (subject to certain exemptions) to all those who receive in-patient services for in excess of 30 days over a rolling 12 month period.</p><p>  In the interests of fairness and equity, the HSE circulated directions to ensure the standard and consistent application of the 2005 legislation on charges for in-patient respite care services across all HSE areas at the end of March 2013.  This was intended to bring any remaining areas not charging for in-patient respite care services into line with other areas that were already doing so.</p><p>  The level of the charges is based on income and cannot exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension.  The Regulations provide for a maximum charge of &euro;175 per week where in-patient care is provided in a setting with 24-hour nursing care or a maximum of &euro;130 per week where in-patient care is provided in other settings.

The Government's aim is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years implemented early next year, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions and the completion of a fee-setting process.<br/><br/>The Government will prioritise persons aged 70 and over in the second phase of the introduction of a universal GP service.  This measure will be facilitated under the existing General Medical Services contract after the relevant legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>The Framework Agreement also makes provision for discussions to commence on the overall GMS contract while work on the under 6 contract is progressing.  The HSE/Department and the IMO have commenced talks on a new GP contract.  A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of issues about the provision of GP services to rural and deprived areas.<br/><br/>Formal engagement on contractual issues is conducted through a process of negotiations with the IMO, which has represented the interests of GPs, as independent contractors, for the past number of decades and which is a party to the current agreement upon which GMS GP contracts are legally founded.<br/><br/>I am open to receiving the views of any interested party in the development of GP services as a key component of the overall health system.  In this context, Leo Varadkar TD, Minister for Health and I met with the National Association of General Practitioners on 6<sup>th</sup>November 2014 and there is likely to be further engagement in future.</p></reply>

From 2015 Departments and Agencies will have discretion over staffing levels within the overall framework of their pay budget.  This policy change will give HSE management greater autonomy to manage their own staffing profile.  The change from a rigid employment control framework with a moratorium on recruitment to a focus on achieving the most cost-effective staffing profile within an allocated pay framework will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery, such as through the replacement of agency staff by staff on fixed term contracts of employment. </p><p>  There is an identified need to achieve savings on agency expenditure within the HSE.  Management of health spending within available resources next year will require an exceptional management focus with strict adherence by all services and budget holders to their allocations.  The HSE has issued a memorandum to management on measures to reduce agency usage and costs across the HSE and HSE funded acute hospital services.  It provides for the replacement of NCHD and Consultant agency with fixed term contracts of employment, and limits reliance on doctors employed on an agency basis.  It also provides for the identification of nursing posts currently filled by agency staff which could be directly replaced by two year contracts of employment.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <br/><br/>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <br/><br/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. <br/><br/>In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014.  The HSE's Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit has since been engaging with the company seeking improved commercial offering.  These engagements have been completed and the HSE is now considering the outcome of those commercial engagements.  Fampridine will be assessed along with a range of other applications for reimbursement of medicines for multiple sclerosis and other diseases.<br/><br/>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

Referral for care under the TAS is restricted to referral by an Irish based consultant who is treating the patient in a public capacity.  Authorisation for treatment under the TAS must be sought and granted prior to availing of the treatment; otherwise the patient will be liable for the costs. <br/><br/>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,</i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the Health Service Executive, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.<br/><br/>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

The time frames for the consideration and recommendation of these cases are as follows: 149 within 0 to 3 days, 230 within 4 to 10 days and the balance of 110 are within 11 to 20 days.</p><p>  There are currently 11 Medical Officers, from across the HSE local health areas, engaged on a part-time basis to undertake medical card eligibility assessments.

Since then, as part of the process for assessing VHI's application for authorisation by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI), the Bank has specified its requirements for the specialist competencies that should be held by VHI board members.  The CBI requires particular types of expertise and skill mix for the VHI Board, and an appropriate mix between executive and non executive directors.  The CBI assesses all nominations for Board membership under its own independent fitness and probity regime before appointments to the VHI Board can be made.

Minister of State Se&aacute;n Sherlock, T.D. has accompanied me most weeks.  During that period work has been done across the four streams of discussions of the talks: (1) financial and budgetary issues, including welfare reform; (2) parades, flags and identity, and the past, as addressed in the Haass proposals and discussed in the all-party talks over the past year; (3) the functioning of the NI Assembly and Executive and the delivery of the Programme for Government; and (4) the implementation of key outstanding elements of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.</p><p>  Review meetings to gauge progress took place on 5 November and again on 26 November. In recent weeks especially, there has been an increase in the momentum and intensity of the talks. There remains much work to be done, and the Irish Government is fully committed to playing its role in that regard.</p><p>  I reported to the Taoiseach on 28 November, outlining the progress made to date and setting forth my views of the prospects for the coming weeks.  There is a broad consensus   that the window for an agreement is this side of Christmas.  It will require absolute resolve to deliver on this.</p><p>  This week, I will return to Belfast for further talks. Former Senator Gary Hart, Secretary of State Kerry&rsquo;s Personal Representative, will also be in Belfast this week to meet with the parties. I look forward to further engagement with Senator Hart, whose experience, energy and advice will I am sure make a significant contribution to our collective efforts. </p></reply>

In the course of his meetings there in November 2014, he met with a senior Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative and raised this case, noting that it is a matter of grave concern in Ireland.Officials in my Department have also recently raised this case, and our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan.<br/><br/>Freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression play a central role in the EU&rsquo;s dialogue with Pakistan.<br/><br/>On 18 October this year, a spokesperson for the European External Action Service expressed deep concern and sadness at the High Court decision to uphold this conviction. They also called on Pakistan to ensure for all its citizens, full respect of human rights as guaranteed by international conventions to which it is party.<br/><br/>The death penalty in Pakistan and this case were also the subject of a statement made on behalf of the then EU High Representative Catherine Ashton at a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 October last. In the course of this, it was noted that the EU, particularly its Delegation in Islamabad, would continue to both follow the case closely and to advocate for the verdict to be overturned. While not trying to intervene in an ongoing court case, the Statement noted that the EU would use any opportunity to raise this case and the wider issues of the death penalty and blasphemy law, with Pakistan.<br/><br/>The current EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, also visited Pakistan at the end of last October where he held an in depth dialogue with the Pakistan authorities on key human rights issues.<br/><br/>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or<font color="#FF0000"> </font>belief.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-02a.1011.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120200073#WRV04700"><p>The Garda vetting arrangements for the schools sector operate on a non-statutory basis and have been in place for new employees since 2006.  The vetting arrangements were updated in 2010 and are set out in Department Circular 0063/2010.<br/><br/>The vetting arrangements will operate on a statutory basis when the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 is commenced.  Some amendments are being made to this Act by the Minister for Justice and Equality before it is commenced. <br/><br/>The number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase.  There are 90,121 teachers on the Teaching Council register and 53,753 of them have been vetted. This represents about 60% of the teachers on the register.  A breakdown of these teachers by sector is attached for the Deputy's information.<br/><br/>The remaining balance of 36,368 that are not vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to 2006. Over the years the lack of capacity in the Garda Central Vetting Unit has been an impediment to getting all these existing teachers vetted. <br/><br/>The Garda Central Vetting Unit indicated to the Department, at a meeting in July 2014, that it now has capacity to vet these remaining teachers that were never vetted.<br/><br/>However, if this is done now under the current non-statutory vetting arrangements it would be confined to a check for criminal offences. <br/><br/>The forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements include a check for relevant &quot;soft information&quot; which is an important new aspect of the vetting arrangements. &quot;Soft information&quot; is referred to as &quot;specified information&quot; in the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 and is information other than criminal convictions held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where such information leads to a bona-fide belief that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<br/><br/>Given that the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant &quot;soft information&quot; the Department considers that at this stage it is better from a child protection perspective to wait for the vetting of these teachers to be done under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements.  This will also dovetail with the amendments that are being made to the Teaching Council Act which include: (a) Linking compliance with the vetting arrangements with renewal of registration; (b) Strengthening the Fitness to Teach provisions so as to provide an appropriate mechanism for assessing a teacher's fitness to remain on the register if a vetting disclosure received in respect of a teacher indicates any potential risk of harm to a child.  Removal of a teacher from the Teaching Council register is the best way of achieving child protection across all schools.<br/><br/>It is intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced.As of 27/11/2014 there were 90,121 teachers on the Register. 53,753 have been vetted. <br/><br/>The breakdown by sector is as follows:<table><tr><th>Registration Regulation</th><th>No. Registered Teachers</th><th>No. Teachers Vetted</th></tr><tr><td>Primary </td><td>42687</td><td>26585</td></tr><tr><td>Montessori and Other Categories</td><td>1277</td><td>646</td></tr><tr><td>Post-primary</td><td>42069</td><td>23657</td></tr><tr><td>Further Education</td><td>6339</td><td>5238</td></tr><tr><td>Sector unknown as teacher has not informed the Teaching Council of their qualification details or they are registered under Section 31(2) &amp;amp; (3).</td><td>1480</td><td>152</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>93852**</td><td>56278**</td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>** Please note that the numbers in the table are higher than the overall total on the register as there are a number of teachers registered in two or more sectors</p></reply>

This allows schools only in urgent or unforeseen cases to engage an unregistered person for up to 5 days at a time.  Circular 52/2013 issued by my Department provides details of the procedures to be followed by school managerial authorities following commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act.</p><p>  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to facilitate newly qualified teachers in achieving full registration with the Teaching Council. The minimum service requirement for probation for primary teachers has been reduced from 170 days to 100 days. Furthermore in certain circumstances the Teaching Council will facilitate teachers who have to travel overseas to secure employment by removing the condition of Probation if they successfully complete a comparable process overseas, provided that this process is certified by the competent authority in the state in question e.g. a teaching council or Ministry of Education.</p><p>  New teachers may avail of the Department of Social Protection's JobBridge National Internship scheme to gain experience and to undertake necessary teaching duties to complete the process of probation and fulfil the requirements for full registration with the Teaching Council. The Work Placement Programme also provides opportunities for graduates to gain work experience in employment in public, private and voluntary sectors.</p><p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). The Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure document 2011 sets out the procedures for appointment of teachers and special needs assistants at primary level.</p><p>  Circular 31/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising unemployed registered teachers over retired registered teachers and registered teachers over unregistered persons.</p><p>  Each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis on the fact that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances in which he or she has had to engage a registered teacher in receipt of a pension under a public service pension scheme or an unregistered person.</p><p>  The allocation of additional funding for the employment of teachers due to the increase in numbers of pupils in the 2015 Budget will assist in creating additional positions which will further assist newly qualified teachers to obtain positions.</p></reply>

The grant is divided between pay and non-pay. Funding in respect of 2013 was allocated on a 12 month basis and based on the VEC configuration.<br/><br/>The total pay grant in 2013 amounted to some &euro;710 million. Of this, &euro;361 million was allocated to the VECs between January and June and &euro;349 million to the ETBs from July to December. In 2014 the ETBs were given an initial pay grant of &euro;668 million. This figure included adjustments for additional teachers and anticipated savings from the Haddington Road Agreement. The amount of the final pay grant for 2014 has not yet been determined and, accordingly, it is not yet possible to determine the difference in the grant between 2013 and 2014.<br/><br/>The non-pay grant to each ETB is to meet costs associated with schools, the ETB's administrative offices and certain other items, such as the schools services support fund, DEIS schools and the book grant. The total non-pay grant in 2013 amounted to some &euro;58 million. Of this, approximately &euro;30 million was allocated to the VECs between January and June and &euro;28 million to the ETBs from July to December.<br/><br/>The Deputy should note that, in 2013, the non-pay grant was reduced by &euro;13.2 million, which took account of the capacity of VECs/ETBs to utilise cash balances on a once off basis. <br/><br/>In 2014, although this reduction in exchequer funding was mostly reinstated, due to other factors, the grant was not fully restored and the initial non-pay grant in 2014 is &euro;69 million approximately. The final non-pay grant for 2014 has not yet been determined and, accordingly, it is not yet possible to determine the difference in the grant between 2013 and 2014.</p></reply>

It includes a combination of 60% of marks to be allocated to a final exam at the end of third year which will be set and marked by the SEC, alongside 40% of marks to be allocated for school based work such as portfolios and projects to be assessed by teachers which will be accompanied by the SEC monitoring 10-15% of this marking.</p><p>  What is assessed is valued; school based assessment promotes a learning culture in schools. It recognises and rewards skills which cannot readily be assessed through externally assessed written final examinations.</p><p>  It is essential that students are marked by their own teachers to promote better student learning and improved student outcomes. School based assessment empowers teachers to support the unique talents and skills of the students in their classrooms. It allows for a much more rounded picture of student achievement to emerge.</p><p>  This combined approach with its external checks and balances will lead to state certification on completion of junior cycle.  It will have integrity and validity and teachers will be supported in this change.</p><p>  This reform is not about protecting systems, it is about improving standards. The integrity of the existing junior certificate will be maintained and improved by my proposal.</p></reply>

In total, more than &euro;70 million has been approved to allow over 770 primary and post primary schools nationally undertake improvement works under the Scheme. This funding facilitated consideration of applications submitted under the Scheme in the following categories  i.e. Gas, Electrical, Mechanical, Toilet Facilities and Roof Works. Almost &euro;10 million was approved to primary schools in the Dublin area for works within these Categories.  A total of 711 applications were received from primary schools in the above categories, of which 664 applications were deemed valid in accordance with the terms of the scheme and of which in turn, 582 applications were grant aided.<br/><br/>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for heating works under the 2014 Summer Works Scheme. The application concerned did not include mandatory project information required in accordance with the scheme and therefore the application was deemed invalid. </p></reply>

While great progress has been made at post primary where every school will shortly have a high speed connection, I am aware that improvement at primary is slower and is dependent upon market and technological developments.<br/><br/>Under the Schools Broadband Access Programme, my Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary schools. A new framework involving more providers was put in place in 2012 which will ensure improved solutions are available to schools.<br/><br/>In the context of the forthcoming Digital Strategy for Schools, improved connectivity for primary schools will be a priority. In this regard, my Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to provide enhanced broadband services.<br/><br/>There are currently 157 schools in receipt of broadband speeds in excess of 30Mbit/s (see attached table). There are further 54 schools awaiting an install of connections in excess of 30Mbit/s and there are another 59 schools who have not responded to the Department's offer of an improved connection. The Department is continually working with providers to ensure that where possible improved services are made available to schools. <br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th>School Roll Number</th><th>School

The NPPR Charge of &euro;200 per annum, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect NPPR charges and late payment fees due to it, and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned. In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.<br/><br/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 , my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at , encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance in respect of dealing with hardship cases. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  All non-compliant owners or owners with queries should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make any outstanding payments. </p></reply>

My Department operates a delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium in relation to local authorities, and any exceptions to the moratorium in local authorities require sanction from my Department.    Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for each Chief Executive, in the first instance, to ensure that the moratorium is implemented while the appropriate service levels are maintained. </p><p>My Department examines all staffing sanction requests on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. In considering sanction requests public safety, maintaining key front line services, and economic issues are given precedence.   </p><p>As announced in the recent Budget, it is proposed that with effect from 2015, the moratorium and the Employment Control Framework for the Public Service will be lifted but recruitment / promotion will be subject to adherence to binding 3 year pay ceilings.

The first report, entitled <i>Social Housing at the Crossroads: Possibilities for Investment, Provision and Cost Rental</i>, provided a significant input into the formulation of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support</i><i>,</i><i>Supply and Reform</i>approved by Government and published last week.<br/><br/>The new Strategy builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery, and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.The strategy provides a clear governance structure to ensure delivery of all actions.The private rental sector is a key pillar in the delivery of the strategy and a number of actions are committed to in relation to that sector. These include a commitment under Action 35 to the development of a national policy aimed at increasing investment in and supporting the supply of, good quality, secure and affordable rental accommodation by the end of 2015.

The aim is to encourage local authorities across the EU to introduce and promote sustainable transport measures and to invite their citizens to try out alternatives to car use. It is a matter for individual local authorities to decide upon their participation in European Mobility Week and to allocate appropriate funding from their own budgets.  On the broader issue of sustainable transport and travel, my Department understands that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTAS) is currently funding and overseeing the roll-out of infrastructural projects to actively promote sustainable travel.   </p><p>There are nine active travel town projects currently under development by local authorities with the aim of achieving an increase in modal shift from the car to cycling and walking. This programme of infrastructural works will enhance the cycling and walking environments and make them more attractive to use for the local communities.   </p><p>  DTTAS also funds the Green Schools Programme which is run by the National Transport Authority (NTA) with the aim of increasing the numbers of students walking and cycling to school.  There is a similar programme also run by the NTA and funded by DTTAS to incentivise workplace and college campuses to modify their modes of transport away from using the car to public transport, cycling and walking. That Department also ran a very successful Bike Week in June with participation by local communities across the country being facilitated through the local authorities. The NTA also runs smarter travel projects in Dublin and the Greater Dublin Area as well as in the regional cities.</p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full , with flexibility to meet potential future demand.    The strategy provides a clear governance structure, which as Minister I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery. Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector. </p><p>For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives, with a further 8,400 households assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). The specific funding to be provided next year across all the various housing programmes will shortly be published in the 2015 Revised Estimates Volume.   </p><p>Pending the finalisation of allocations for 2015, local authorities are continuing to work on projects announced in 2014. These include a local authority housing construction programme valued at &euro;68 million nationally and delivering 449 new units of accommodation, and over &euro;46 million allocated to Approved Housing Bodies to provide 416 units of accommodation nationally, for people with special housing needs. Local authorities are currently undertaking a programme of targeted acquisitions, which will see in the region of 240 units of accommodation being acquired to accommodate people on the social housing waiting list, with particular emphasis on providing accommodation for homeless persons, people with special needs and other priority cases as identified by the housing authorities.   </p><p>  My Department has also made available an investment of &euro;30 million in 2014, through funding allocated under the stimulus package for the construction sector and allocations to refurbish vacant properties, which will result in some 1,960 vacant local authority owned units being returned to productive use.</p></reply>

Almost all local authorities have now exited the waste collection market.<br/><br/>Collection of waste by a private operatoris subject to compliance with applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, primarily the Waste Management Act 1996 and conditions attached to each waste collector&rsquo;s collection permit issued under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007.Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws , and enforcement of waste legislation, a waste collection permit condition or waste bye-law is a matter for the relevant local authority.<br/><br/>As Minister, I am specifically precluded under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the Agency or a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. My role as Minister in terms of waste management is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which waste management enforcement authorities work. <br/><br/>In this regard, as part of the introduction of a radical and comprehensive new regulatory framework to reform the regulation of the collection of household waste in 2015, I intend to introduce measures to require collectors to have a customer charter in place and to meet certain minimum standards of customer service , such as specified frequencies of collection .I will be setting out in law what the minimum content of these customer charters will be , so that standards of service are raised and are consistent. It will also become a statutory requirement for all collectors to operate the &ldquo;pay-by-weight&rdquo; system as a condition of their permit.<br/><br/>The regulation of weighing mechanisms used to determine weight-based waste collection charges is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland and queries in this regard should be directed to that body.</p></reply>

The scheme is one of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and to be included in the scheme applicants must be able to demonstrate to the Pyrite Resolution Board that they have no practicable options other than under the scheme to secure the remediation of their dwelling.   </p><p>There are a number of stages involved in the application process under the pyrite remediation scheme . However, once a dwelling is included in the scheme, the Housing Agency will undertake the procurement of professional services and the   establishment of remediation contracts.     This will include the appointment of design professionals to survey, test, design, inspect and certify the remediation of dwellings in accordance with I.S. 398-2: 2013: Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works . The purpose of the design professional&rsquo;s survey is to determine and record the damage caused by pyritic heave in the affected dwelling.   This allows the design professional to prepare a Remedial Works Plan specific to each dwelling. Under the Remedial Works Plan s, t he reinstatement of the building elements will normally be on a &ldquo;like for like&rdquo; basis relative to a standard that existed prior to the occurrence of damage caused by pyritic heave, having regard to good building practice .   </p><p>It should be noted that the survey is   a not full condition survey of the affected dwelling and will therefore not address any other defects, damage or substandard work, if such exists.   Any such work that is observed during the survey, not attributable to pyritic heave, is outside the scope of the scheme and will not form part of the Remedial Works Plan.   Any defect, damage or substandard work not attributable to pyritic heave that is of concern to a scheme participant should be investigated by his or her own building professional.</p></reply>

Neither I, nor my Department, has any direct role in relation to the granting of permission for new developments or in relation to any oversight or enforcement activity under the various Acts outlined. The relevant statutory powers are vested in local authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and I cannot intervene in any individual case. In general, however, I expect local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address issues of compliance with regulatory requirements, including in relation to fire safety, where they arise and to respond appropriately to any concerns which are brought to their attention.   </p><p>The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which came into operation on 1 March 2014, greatly strengthen the arrangements in place for the control of building activity. In particular the regulations empower competence and professionalism in design and construction and require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certificates of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspection during construction and validation and registration of statutory certificates. I am satisfied that this key reform of the regulatory framework represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector.</p></reply>

Performance pay under this system is based on a structured performance review and requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met.

The purpose of Regulation 6 is to ensure that each rental property has exclusive access to its own sanitary facilities and that those facilities are contained within the dwelling unit. Regulation 7 relates to effective heating which can be independently managed by the tenant, while Regulation 8 provides for sole access to adequate facilities for the hygienic storage, preparation and cooking of food.  The 2008 Regulations came into effect generally on 1 February 2009 but allowed a four year phasing-in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out in respect of Regulations 6, 7 and 8. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their properties comply with the regulations and responsibility for their enforcement rests with the local authorities, funded from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).Since 2005, over 149,000 inspections have been carried out by local authorities on properties in the sector.<br/><br/>Census 2011 indicated that there were approximately 4,500 bed-sits across the country &ndash; the majority of which are found in Dublin &ndash; accounting for 1% of households in the private rented sector. A recent report from Dublin City Council found that the majority of dwellings selected for inspection (which were pre-1963 multi-unit buildings and more likely to be in this category of accommodation) were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection. <br/><br/>These inspections were part of an intensified inspection programme funded by my Department that commenced in 2012 and is due to run until March 2015 . It specifically targeted concentrations of rented properties which were deemed to be at risk of non-compliance with the legislation.Up to October 2014 , 66% of the non-compliant properties had been brought into compliance. Enforcement action continues against the remainder, including legal action in certain cases.<br/><br/>On 20 May 2014, the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at, <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. <br/><br/>Finally, Budget 2015 made provision for the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) scheme to be extended to include landlords who are subject to income tax. It will apply to repairs, renovations or improvements to rental properties carried out on or after 15 October 2014.</p></reply>

The new Social Housing Strategy 2020provides a clear governance structure for the advancement of social housing targets which I, as Minister, will personally oversee to ensure delivery. <br/><br/>Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector.  For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives, with a further 8,400 households assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment. As part of the local authority housing construction and acquisitions programme, there is a target of 946 units, and a further 440 through approved housing bodies under the Capital Assistance Scheme.<br/><br/>In addition to the above, planning and development work is already underway for the delivery between now and 2016 of 449 new units of accommodation for people on housing waiting lists as part of a local authority social housing construction programme, details of which are available at the following link: <br/><br/>This is alongside the delivery of 416 units by approved housing bodies for people with special housing needs, which is also already underway under the Capital Assistance Scheme, details of which are available at .</p></reply>

Our public water infrastructure is deficient and inadequate as a consequence of decades of under-investment and the lack of a truly, national approach that could maximise the impact of investment.</p><p>  An Independent Assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network. The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility.  This was implemented through the Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which provided for the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to Irish Water. The transfer of responsibility took effect on 1 January 2014.</p><p>  In advance of the introduction of water charges, Irish Water sent application packs to approximately 2 million households. The objective of the application process was to enable customers to confirm their details for billing and relevant PPS numbers were requested in order for customers to claim the allowances that they were eligible for.</p><p>  On 19 November 2014, the Government decided on the introduction of a number of measures in relation to a revised approach to water charges. This was done to provide clarity and certainty and ensure that water charges are affordable for customers. As the new arrangements are based on self-declaration and appropriate audit, PPS numbers will no longer be required by Irish Water. In compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts, Irish Water will delete PPS data already collected during the customer registration process to protect customers&rsquo; data. Irish Water has developed a protocol in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address this data deletion exercise.</p><p>  A minimum charge of &euro;125 per year will apply for dwellings that are not permanently occupied which are using both water supply and waste water services. The minimum charge for dwellings connected to a single service will be &euro;62.50 per year. This applies to metered and unmetered dwellings. Such dwellings with meters installed will pay &euro;3.70 per 1,000 litres for usage above the equivalent usage for the minimum charge. A cap of &euro;260 per annum for such dwellings will apply.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</p><p>  The maximum grant per beneficiary for equipment is as follows:</p><p>- Monitored personal alarms (with pendant) - &euro;250</p><p>- Additional pendant/Re-installation - &euro;50</p><p>  The annual monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60-&euro;80 per annum) are borne by the beneficiary.</p><p>  As Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I am responsible for setting the terms and conditions of the Seniors Alert Scheme, which are designed to guide its operation, to ensure optimum outcomes and to ensure that public funds are properly applied. My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and from this it was recommended that the scheme be managed by Pobal with effect from 1 January 2015, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.</p><p>  Pobal will provide management and administrative services for the Seniors Alert Scheme. This will include a national tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. A panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.</p><p>  Monitoring has always been the responsibility of the beneficiary and this is not changing. There are no implications for existing installations in respect of the Pobal tender competition; however, under the new arrangements, Pobal are also providing a facility for beneficiaries to choose from a panel of monitoring companies or to continue with their current monitoring company. In this regard Pobal will also set up a panel of pre-qualified telecare service providers, who provide monitoring services, and this was publicly advertised on eTenders on 6 November 2014.  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme and it will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to interact with the elderly in the local community.</p></reply>

The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.  To address these significant shortcomings, my Department has been working, in full consultation with all parts of the tyre industry, to assist it in putting in place a system of producer responsibility, in line with those that apply to other sectors, to provide for the collection, sorting and management of the waste they produce in an environmentally sound manner. This is in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo; which is a firmly established feature of both domestic waste policy and legislation.  This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses. Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases.</p><p>  Arising from the work of the Tyres Working Group, which includes representatives from across the waste and tyres industries, my Department has now received proposals for the future management of waste tyres from the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) and the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA). While it would have been my preference for all sides within the industry to come together in support of a single proposal, the separate proposals are being considered by my Department. I expect to receive recommendations arising from this consideration in the near future and, once I have made my decision, I will engage once more with all sides of the tyre industry to collaborate in putting in place the detailed legislative underpinning for the operation and enforcement of the new system. Following these developments, my Department will aim to have the new model for waste compliance in the tyre sector operational by mid-2015.</p></reply>

Over 4,700 new construction projects have been notified to Building Control Authorities across the local government sector since these regulations came into operation on 1 March 2014. Evidence to date suggests that the Construction industry is responding well to the new regulatory framework. Oversight of activity by industry and by local building control authorities has improved immeasurably and authorities have ready access to detailed data on projects via the online Building Control Management System. The online system streamlines building control administration and enables authorities to identify risks and track progress.<br/><br/>  A Framework for Building Control Authorities was adopted by the City and County Management Association on 17 July 2014 &ndash; these common protocols add clarity, efficiency and consistency to building control activities across the local government sector.<br/><br/>  I am satisfied that this key reform of the regulatory framework represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector. My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, industry stakeholders and members of the public generally to ensure that all concerned understand their obligations under the regulations and how they can comply with these in practice. A review of the first year of operation of the regulations will be undertaken by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and industry stakeholders.

In broad terms, since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance (DoP) and to affix the CE mark when a product covered by a harmonised European standard, or a European Technical Assessment (ETA), is placed on the market.  The DoP serves to deliver the information about the essential characteristics of the product that a manufacturer wants to make available to the market. The manufacturer, by drawing up a DoP, assumes responsibility for the conformity of the construction product with the declared performances.</p><p>  Harmonised European standards provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics. In order to ensure that the DoPs for specific products are accurate and reliable, the performance of the construction products shall be assessed and their production in the factory shall be controlled to ensure that the products will continue to have the same performances. This is achieved by applying a system of Assessment and Verification of Constancy of Performance (AVCP) for each family of construction products.</p><p>  The harmonised European standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of the AVCP system including third party oversight (determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved) which the manufacturer is required to comply with. In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.</p><p>  The EN 771 series of standards cover the specification for masonry units.  I.S. EN 771-3: 2011 Specification for masonry units - Part 3: Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates) is the relevant harmonised European standard for concrete blocks.  This standard specifies the characteristics and performance requirements of aggregate concrete masonry units made from dense and lightweight aggregates for which the main intended uses are common, facing or exposed masonry in load bearing or non-load bearing building and civil engineering applications.</p><p>  Specific guidance on the minimum acceptable performances for concrete blocks for use in Ireland to supplement the harmonised European standard is included in the NSAI Standard Recommendation, S.R. 325:2013+A1:2014 Recommendations for the use of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6. S.R. 325 provides guidance on strength, moisture movement, reaction to fire etc. and crucially requires the aggregates for use in dense concrete blocks to comply with I.S. EN 12620. This is important given that the NSAI has also produced a Standard Recommendation entitled S.R. 16 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002 - Aggregates for concrete which includes an example specification in its Annex A covering grading, strength, durability, chemical composition etc. applicable to most general uses of aggregates in concrete in Ireland.</p><p>  S.R. 325 also provides guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work.  To this end, S.R. 325 recommends that Category 1 masonry units (units with a declared compressive strength with a probability of failure to reach it not exceeding 5%) be used, requiring oversight by a third party known as a notified body for the purposes of performing an initial inspection of the factory and of the factory production control and for undertaking continuous surveillance, assessment and approval of the factory production control.</p><p>  Notified bodies are the only recognised third party bodies that can carry out the conformity assessments laid down in the harmonised European standards or the European Technical Assessments. A list of all officially designated notified bodies under the Construction Products Regulation is available on the European Union&rsquo;s New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System.</p><p>  Responsibility for demonstrating a construction product&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements of the Construction Products Regulation and the applicable harmonised European standard rests with the manufacturer although obligations are also imposed on both the importers an d distributors of such products.</p><p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013, building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the remit of Construction Products Regulation.

HAP is designed to bring together all the social housing supports provided by the State, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need, including households in receipt of rent supplement for a lengthy period. Cork County Council is one of 7 housing authorities currently operating HAP on a pilot basis.  A household presenting as homeless to a housing authority is not required to undergo a social housing assessment in order to be placed in temporary accommodation which the Council itself arranges or which is operated by a voluntary service provider. However, in order to qualify for HAP, households must be determined by a housing authority to be qualified for social housing support following a social housing assessment. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 84 of 2011) provide that applicants for social housing support must complete the prescribed application form and provide to the housing authority any additional information sought by the authority for the purpose of verifying information relating to the application. Under the Regulations, housing authorities are expected to deal with applications within 12 weeks of receiving a completed application form or additional information but, in exceptional circumstances, may take up 14 weeks more to process an application. These periods will be reviewed in the light of experience as part of the overall review of social housing assessment and allocation policies announced in the Social Housing Strategy.</p><p>  Under the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household may qualify for social housing support if it has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and meets the other conditions for support. Qualification under this criterion is not dependent on the making of a possession order and my Department has advised housing authorities that, upon receipt of written confirmation from the lender that a household&rsquo;s mortgage has been deemed unsustainable, an authority may determine that the household has a housing need, even though a household member may, at that time, continue to be the legal owner of the accommodation concerned.</p><p>  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 includes an important transitional provision relating to the general principle that housing authorities are not required to provide social housing support for households that own alternative accommodation that could meet their housing need. The new provision relates to households that are qualified for social housing support other than in relation to the issue of whether a household member owns suitable alternative accommodation. An example of this is where a household has left the family home and ownership of that accommodation has not been resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement.  Housing authorities may now support such households under HAP or the Rental Accommodation Scheme until the issue of whether the household owns suitable alternative accommodation is clarified.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme. As such the relevant valuation for the purpose of the scheme is the value of the loans involved and, in that regard, applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.<br/><br/>The figure of &euro;163 m includes &euro;111 m in respect of loans which were, under the first phase of the scheme, fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme. There are no interest payments due on these loans. The remaining &euro;52 m accepted into the Scheme under its second phase is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency. Local authorities may recoup the capital and interest payments from my Department on condition that related LAGS lands have transferred to the Housing Agency. To date, nine of the 26 sites accepted following the introduction of the second iteration of the Scheme have transferred to the Agency. Once all accepted land in LAGS is transferred to the ownership of the Housing Agency it is estimated that the local authorities involved will be eligible to claim recoupment in full in the order of an estimated &euro;2.68 million a year, based on current interest rates.<br/><br/>The table provides a County breakdown in relation to the loans accepted into LAGS under the second Iteration of the scheme.<br/><br/><b>*ANNUITY LAND ACQUISITION LOANS TRANSFERRED TO LAGS</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Local Authority</th><th>Amount transferred to LAGS</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>&euro;960,509.63</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Cork County Council</td><td>&euro;14,110,037.08 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;4,158,868.08 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;8,839,961.43 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;622,331.21 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;8,830,266.81 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;5,712,239.96 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;4,836,977.68 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;3,981,148.71 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick County Council </td><td>-</td><td>&euro;99,397.31 </td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;52,151,737.90 </td></tr></table>My Department does not hold information relating to interest due in 2015 with regard to individual loans. The Housing Finance Agency is responsible for the administration of the loans including the calculation of interest due on individual LAGS loans based on the historic nature of and redemptions made on the loan. When a local authority whose land has successfully transferred to the Housing Agency applies for a recoupment of its annuity loan repayment, it is a matter for the individual Local Authority to provide proof of the capital and interest payment it made to the Housing Finance Agency.</p></reply>

The SRF was designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. T he SRF was particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax waiver, as in a seriously problematic condition.  In December 2013, my Department wrote to local authorities seeking proposals for funding support under the SRF and the deadline for receipt of applications was 28 February 2014. All submissions were evaluated by my Department in accordance with the criteria circulated to the local authorities.  On 2 May 2014, allocations from the Special Resolution Fund were announced and 86 developments were approved for funding. The following link contains a list of all developments approved for SRF funding:<i>FileDownLoad,37996,en.doc.</i><br/><br/>Kildare County Council submitted four applications for funding from the Special Resolution Fund, of which one was approved for the sum of &euro;75,000.

For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has an ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) .   The extent of the challenge posed by these emission reduction targets is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development and the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill , both of which were published in April this year.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by the Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the General Scheme of the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill, which I expect will be published the coming weeks. </p><p>  In anticipation of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Low-Carbon Roadmap to 2050 - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures and identify additional measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low-carbon transition agenda.  As I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets in the first half of the 2013 to 2020 compliance period, the immediate focus of the national low-carbon road-mapping process will be the compliance challenge in the years 2017 to 2020.   </p></reply>

It identified 89,872 households which qualified for social housing support.  Of the 89,872 households recorded as in need of housing as at 7 May, 2013, there were 2,808 households recorded having a housing need due to living in an institution, emergency accommodation or hostel.  Full details of the 2013 Housing Need Assessment, including information on County Kildare, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<br/><br/>On 20 May 2014, the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at: .<br/><br/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports.  Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and a copy of the Quarter 3 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br/><br/>I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation.  Part 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 deals with rent and rent reviews. Under the Act, rent may not be greater than the open market rate and may be reviewed (upward or downward) only once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that warrants a review.  Tenants must be given 28 days&rsquo; notice of the new rent and may ask their landlord to review the rent if they feel it exceeds the market rate for the property.  Disputes about any aspect of rent may be referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PTRB). <br/><br/>The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. Increasing both public and private housing supply is, therefore, a critical issue.  In this regard,the Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support Supply and Reform, approved by Government and published last week, builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and provides a clear governance structure, which as Minister I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery of all actions. The Strategy commits to supplying 35,000 additional social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion over the next 6 years, as well as meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through local authority provision via the private rented sector using the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes, in effect providing a road map to accommodate all those currently on Housing Waiting Lists by 2020. </p></reply>

While an initial draft of the review was received from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures. For example, full information on the status of each local authority&rsquo;s loan book is required in order to accurately determine the implications of any possible solutions to shared ownership issues for local authority debt management generally.  This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. It will be a number of months before sufficient data has been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to finalise the review.  Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress, such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders.

It is understood from the Environmental Protection Agency, that in the monitoring period up to 2012, rivers and groundwaters have shown a slight improvement, lake waters have shown a slight disimprovement, while transitional and coastal waters generally remained stable. There has been a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events in rivers from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites. However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at the highest ecological status.

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, which is available on the EPA website at , was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<br/><br/>Downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted. As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities, where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.<br/><br/>Nitrogen dioxide levels (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels showed a slight increasing trend in the years 2008 ‐ 2010. During this period, NO<sub>2</sub>levels were close to the CAFE limit value at traffic- congested areas in Dublin City and Cork City. However, NO<sub>2</sub>levels decreased from 2010-2012. This downward trend may have stabilised in 2013. To further reduce NO<sub>2</sub>levels in cities, we must develop and implement policies to reduce travel demand, emphasising sustainable transport modes such as cycling, walking and public transport and improving the efficiency of motorised transport.<br/><br/>In respect of monitoring of water quality, the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute collectively monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, and groundwater quality under the Water Framework Directive on a three-year cycle. This extensive national monitoring programme, covering 13,000 km of river channel, 222 lakes, 128 transitional and coastal water bodies and 205 groundwater monitoring locations, provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.<br/><br/>Rivers and groundwaters have shown a slight improvement up to 2012. Lake waters have shown a slight disimprovement, while transitional and coastal waters generally remained stable. There has been a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events in rivers from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites. However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at high ecological status.<br/><br/>A new national update covering the 2010-2012 period will be available by the end of December 2014. Results for 2013 and 2014 will also be made available in early 2015. In the meantime, this year the EPA has published regional reports covering the south east, Louth/Monaghan and Galway/Mayo/Sligo, including information from 2012 monitoring, and regional reports covering 2013 monitoring are due to be published in the coming weeks.  The EPA and local authorities respond to water quality incidents and complaints on an ongoing basis.

There are three interlinked requirements. Firstly , public bodies must, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities. Secondly, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, at least 3% of their employees must be people with disabilities. Finally, on an annual basis, public bodies must report to the statutory Monitoring Committee and to the Minister of their parent Department on the number of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures they are taking to support them in employment.  A Monitoring Committee was established in 2007 to monitor compliance by local authorities and public bodies under the remit of my Department with Part 5 of the Disability Act. The members of this Monitoring Committee (including a person representative of people with disabilities) were appointed for a 3 year term and have met regularly. The Committee has reviewed employment targets to determine levels of compliance with the Government&rsquo;s 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities and has reported each year in relation to compliance by the local authorities and public bodies under the aegis of my Department to the National Disability Authority (NDA) and to the Minister.   </p><p>  Based on returns for 2013, there are only four Local Authorities who are not in full compliance with the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities. This is due to retirement of relevant staff members, limited engagement by staff in the staff census process and the ongoing moratorium on public sector recruitment limiting the ability of local authorities to recruit new staff, including people with disabilities.   </p><p>  Information in respect of competitions advertised by the Public Appointments Service is not collected by my Department.   </p></reply>

I am advised by IFI that as the counter is located beside two sluice gates which salmon can traverse when open, the counter will, when the necessary validation process is complete, contribute a partial count. <br/><br/>As the Deputy will appreciate, a fish counter is a complex piece of electronic equipment operating in a static position within a highly fluid and mobile body of water. The water-body itself is subject to a multiplicity of water levels, weather and other environmental conditions in any operational year. <br/><br/>As is the case with all new counter installations, a research programme, over a number of years will be required to estimate the level of the partial count before the data can be reliably used as a direct index of returning salmon population.<br/><br/>In line with the statutory protection and conservation imperatives, it is long-standing IFI policy not to make verified and reliable fish counter data public in the current operational year as such data can be used by those who wish to engage in illegal activity such as poaching to target particular events and times. <br/><br/>I am advised that some 450 &ldquo;up-river movements&rdquo; were recorded by the, as yet, unverified counter in 2014. However, I am also advised of the need to exercise extreme caution in relation to this raw data as these movements would, include movement of debris and other material, and a variety of fish species. The ability to disaggregate salmon movements within the overall metric will require the completion of the scientific programme and subsequent installation of a video verification array.<br/><br/>I understand that it is not appropriate, at this stage to draw reliable conclusions as regards salmon movements from the counter at present. Once the substantiated estimate of partial count is established in the required research programme, a video verification process will be implemented. However, the fish counter currently provides important information, from a protection perspective, on run timing and when fish enter the system. <br/><br/>As the counter is only active since the end of last year and requires at least three years of data for inclusion in the Independent Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon advice process, the current method of assessing the status of the river is through Catchment Wide Electrofishing (CWEF) surveys. <br/><br/>The data used currently by the Standing Scientific Committee is the CWEF results for the Fergus River which is returning an average of 7.45 fry, well below the required Scientific Committee&rsquo;s threshold of 17 salmon fry per catchment average to consider facilitating a catch and release fishery. <br/><br/>The following represents the CWEF surveys carried out:<br/><br/><b>Catchment Wide Electrofishing Surveys</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Average Fry per 5 minute fish</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>5.89</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>6.84</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>4.10</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>12.96</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The studies and reports are required to include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The terms of reference for the work to be carried out were published in May 2014 and are available on my Department's website.    EirGrid will either undertake or commission the necessary work in accordance with those terms of reference set by the Panel. In due course, the Panel will provide an opinion to me on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two reports prior to EirGrid proceeding to public consultation on the two projects. The Panel expects to be in a position to provide an opinion to me on the Grid West project in Quarter 1 2015. An opinion on the Grid Link project is expected in Quarter 3 2015.</p><p>  As a matter of course, EirGrid regularly reviews its strategies and projects. Grid25 was originally developed in 2008 when the macro-economic climate was very different. In line with EirGrid&rsquo;s review policy, Grid25 was updated in 2011, when the scale and scope was reduced to reflect the change in circumstances. As a result the estimated cost was revised downwards from &euro;4 billion to &euro;3.2 billion.</p><p>  In May this year, EirGrid initiated a further update of Grid25 to take into account the most up-to-date information available, including technical feasibility, future economic and demand projections, and environmental impacts. Following discussions with my Department, this update also includes an independent review to verify the original strategies of Grid25 on the basis of changing circumstances since 2008. EirGrid expects this review to be completed and published early in 2015.</p><p>  EirGrid's Grid25 Plan includes provision for facilitating increased interconnection to other EU Member States, providing for both imports and exports of electricity as appropriate. This is in line with the European Union&rsquo;s goal of a fully integrated Internal Energy Market. The 500MW East-West Interconnector with the UK has already been completed, and other possible options are being considered.</p></reply>

However, I have been advised by EirGrid that submissions for the third round of public consultation for the Grid Link project closed on January 7, 2014. Over 38,000 submissions were received, and each one has been considered individually. I understand there are a small number of submissions still under consideration due to the very technical information required to respond adequately to them. The nature of the submissions encompassed a wide range of topics including agriculture, human and animal health, visual impact, community gain, proximity to dwellings, schools and community facilities, and environmental factors. More information is available on EirGrid&rsquo;s website at the following address:<br/><br/>The ESRI and ESB submissions were two of over 1,240 responses received to the public consultation on the Energy Policy Green Paper. Insofar as the ESB submission is concerned, it is worth noting that ESB has welcomed the continuing review of EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 Strategy and its ongoing reflection on future grid investment priorities. Both EirGrid and ESB agree that a medium to long-term perspective is necessary in relation to building grid infrastructure, and that Grid25 is required to both facilitate future electricity demand and support balanced regional development. Both companies also acknowledge the need for the rollout of electricity networks to address citizen and community concerns, and to accommodate evolving European energy policy, including in relation to renewable energy. ESB fully supports the EU 2020 target of 16% renewable energy, which entails having 40% of electricity generated from renewable sources. It is important to note that my Department, ESB and EirGrid are all in agreement on the appropriateness and prudence of the 40% target, which is based on solid scientific and engineering evidence.<br/><br/>The question of Proximity Payments is also a matter for EirGrid. However, the July 2012 &quot;Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure&quot; underlined the appropriateness of incorporating community gain considerations into major infrastructure projects. In recognition of the potential impact of transmission infrastructure, EirGrid responded in January 2014 with proposals regarding a community gain mechanism which are set on EirGrid's website at </p></reply>

There is no price control in the oil sector and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice. I have no statutory function in the setting of oil, petrol or diesel prices. Previous surveys have shown that prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude. Investigations and surveys into oil prices have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency, such as the Investigation into Petrol &amp;amp; Diesel Price Movements, and these are available on the Agency's website at . The research indicates that the price paid at the pump by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis. The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>As of November 24th 2014, the price of petrol in Ireland was &euro;1.45 per litre including taxes and duties, while the price of diesel was &euro;1.39 per litre including taxes and duties. The weighted EU average for the EU 28 for the same week was &euro;1.46 per litre for petrol including taxes and duties and &euro;1.30 per litres for diesel including taxes and duties. While Ireland's diesel price last week was slightly higher than the EU average, our petrol prices were lower. It is also worth noting that Ireland was around mid point on the list of EU Member States.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances.All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.<br/><br/>Following its meeting of 30 September, the Government announced a revised model for ministerial appointments to State boards. From November 1 all appointments to State boards must be advertised openly on the State Boards portal, www.stateboards.ie, which is operated by the Public Appointments Service and at its meeting of 25 November 2014, the Government agreed the publication of guidelines entitled &ldquo;.  These guidelines are to assist Departments in implementing the new arrangements for appointments to State Boards, and have been prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform following consultation with the Public Appointments Service, other Government Departments and interested parties and provide detailed guidance on the appointments process, including issues related to diversity. <br/><br/>There have been 32 appointments made to State Boards under the aegis of my Department in 2014 to date, of which 6 appointments were made of persons from whom expressions of interest applications had been received.</p></reply>

In each case, the driver is required to surrender his or her licence.</p><p>  A person who appears in court for an alleged offence under the Road Traffic Acts is required to produce their driving licence or learner permit, and a copy of it, in court.  Failure to do so is an offence.  Where a case results in the individual being disqualified, the licence can therefore be retained by the court at the end of the process.  The implementation of the provisions is a matter for the Courts Service.</p><p>  Where the licence was not produced in court, or where the disqualification was due to penalty points, the driver is required to surrender it subsequently. Where a person reaches the penalty point threshold, a notification issues to the person informing them that they must surrender their driving licence to the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS). In addition to this notification, a notice is issued to the licensing authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na informing them of each individual penalty point disqualification to ensure that they are aware of the disqualification as well as the driver.</p><p>  It is an offence to drive while disqualified, whether or not the licence has been surrendered.  Once the driver is disqualified, the licence is no longer valid.  In addition, Garda&iacute; have the power to demand production of a driving licence and, may seize such licence where the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the individual has been disqualified.   I will, however, ensure that the matter of disqualified drivers surrendering licences is considered in the context of the Criminal Justice Working Group deliberations of the Fixed Charge Processing System, with a view to ensuring that the most effective arrangements are in place for the surrender of all licences.</p><p>  In regard to the figures of cases where people disqualified did not surrender licences, this is a matter for the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  I have therefore forwarded these aspects of the questions to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p></reply>

The decision to centralise driver licence provision was taken following a study of the costs of options for the provision of the service.  This showed that significant savings could be achieved through a centralised service, as opposed to the then system of provision through local authorities, which involved many duplications of functions.<br/><br/>The reason for requiring people to apply in person rather online or by post is ID security.  The NDLS is intended to operate to the Government SAFE (Standard Authentication Framework Environment) 2 level of ID security.  This requires a face-to-face authentication of ID, and digital image capture on-site.<br/><br/>Once a person has had their ID authenticated to SAFE 2 standard, they do not need to appear in person again when renewing or replacing their licence.</p></reply>

The club has leasehold title to the property.  A Deed of Covenant and Charge is being drafted by the Chief State Solicitor's Office for the 2012 grant and previous funding.  As the club's title is leasehold and the lease contains a forfeiture clause, a landlord agreement is required.  The Landlord Agreement is an assurance by the landlord that the facility will be kept in sporting use if the tenant forfeits the lease.    </p><p>  The club has not yet been able to provide the landlord agreement and as the full legal requirements have not yet been met, formal approval cannot be granted.

In particular, Section 32 of the 1996 Act places the responsibility on the holders of waste to ensure that it is managed in a manner that does not cause environmental  pollution.  Enforcement of waste legislation including action against illegal activity is a matter for local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE) within the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>  My Department has replied directly to the individual concerned to confirm that it did not receive copies of the signed contracts for Phases 1 and 2 of the R158 upgrade works on the Trim to Kilcock Road.  Furthermore, the Department has clarified that the parties to these contracts would have been Meath County Council and the successful contractor in each case.  Accordingly Meath County Council and/or its solicitor would have had possession. </p><p>  I understand that Meath County Council submitted a report on unauthorised dumping adjacent to the R158 to the EPA on the 10th July 2014.  As the Statutory Agency with responsibility for enforcement of waste legislation the EPA is the appropriate agency for adjudicating on and pursuing such cases.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, neither I nor my Department has any function in this matter. </p></reply>

I am happy to again clarify the position regarding this regional road scheme.<br/><br/>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<br/><br/>It is important to state that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Kerry County Council in their own resources spending this area.  While Councils could apply in the past for grant funding for certain road improvement projects, budgetary constraints mean that the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme has been curtailed in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work of the road network.<br/><br/>It is, of course, open to the Kerry County Council to fund the project from its own resources.</p></reply>

However, it was clear that the funding proposed by the employers is the maximum that can be achieved.  Therefore, having considered the Trustee's request and reflected on all of the issues relating to the IASS, including the significant deficit of &euro;750m, I signed the Commencement Order on 17 November 2014.  </p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that this will cause for many members but the risks that will arise for all members, the companies and the wider economy in the event of failure of this solution are even greater and this is the reason that I commenced these provisions.  I believe that the funding proposal put forward by the Trustee offers the best possible outcome for all members given the acute difficulties and unsustainable circumstances of this fund. </p></reply>

Furthermore, the key priority over the coming years will be to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If additional funds are available, which is not certain, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.  Any additional funds will be prioritised for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure.  </p><p>  Subject to funding availability, some projects which are part of the overall DART Underground Programme, and which have capacity benefits in and of themselves, may proceed over the next number of years.

The IFB is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry, including the animation sector. <br/><br/>Irish animation is a dynamic, growing and highly international sector that is making a significant impact on the global animation scene.  Irish media and entertainment companies are becoming more export focused, providing award-winning content that is bought by companies such as Disney, Nickelodeon and the BBC and viewed by millions in over 130 territories worldwide.  It is estimated that over 1,000 persons are employed as technical and creative staff in animation studios in Ireland.<br/><br/>The Government remains focused on the development of this sector, with the following supports in place: the recently enhanced 32% Section 481 film tax incentive, which is available for film and television, is in place until 2020; investment in Irish talent and Irish animated film and television content is made through development and production loans from the IFB; strategic company development support is available through Enterprise Ireland (EI); international promotional support is available from the IFB and EI for the industry at major festivals and international markets; investment in training is available from Screen Training Ireland (STI), the training arm of the IFB, as well as through Animation Skillsnet, which is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education and Skills; and support for TV animation projects with an Irish broadcaster is available from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. <br/><br/>The development and promotion of Irish animated content is a priority for the IFB.  To this end, the IFB provides a significant level of development funding for home-grown Irish content, which aims to off-set some of the risk in the development of Irish animated content and IP.  Since 2009, the IFB has invested almost &euro;1.6 million in the development of Irish animated film and TV projects, which is directly aimed at supporting the growth of the animation sector.<br/><br/>The IFB is the largest funder for animation production activity in the country.  Since 2006, the agency has provided almost &euro;11 million in funding for Irish content to the sector.  The level of IFB support for the animation sector did not reduce following the economic downturn, despite the overall reduction in IFB funding since 2008. <br/><br/>The IFB, through STI, provides training across all sectors of the industry and is particularly active in the area of digital production, which includes animation.  Over the past number of years, STI has trained almost 1,500 professionals at all levels in the animation industry, These ranged from graduates entering the industry to animation CEOs, including animation directors, production managers, producers, storyboard artists and animators, together with a diversity of digital artists specialising in a range of disciplines in animation, including rigging, lighting, texturing, and shading.  <br/><br/>STI and the IFB have for the past two years supported <i>The Bridge Programme</i>, an initiative of Animation Skillnet and the Dublin Business Innovation Centre, which pairs teams of animation graduates with local studios on active projects, in order to expose them to professional working practices in a studio environment.  Many of these graduates have subsequently found employment in animation studios.</p></reply>

My Department is currently considering the funding available for the protection and conservation of the built heritage in 2015 in the context of its overall allocation and I will publish details of funding schemes for 2015 as soon as these are finalised.</p></reply>

As referred to in my reply to Question No. 192 on 19 November 2014,   the structure is under serious threat from coastal erosion.  Overall policy for coastal protection, including coastal flooding and erosion, is a matter for the Office of Public Works, while the identification and addressing of coastal protection measures in any particular area is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authority concerned. My Department continues to be available to offer advice should any proposals for coastal protection works at the site be brought forward.  </p></reply>

The strategy document set out recommendations for the creation of a process towards the establishment of a park with a management framework for the Liffey Valley area. The implementation of those recommendations, or similar steps, is a matter for the local authorities concerned.The strategy document did not recommend the designation of Liffey Valley as a National Park and the position in that regard remains unchanged.</p></reply>

Guidelines in this regard have just been published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I am now working to implement this revised model in my Department.With regard to the information sought by the Deputy, I am advised that, during 2014:8 appointments were made where the positions were not advertised; 18 re-appointments were made, the bulk of which related to a single body with an academic focus on which the members serve <i>pro bono</i>; and 3 people were appointed to boards in an ex-officio capacity on the nomination of an external body.  In 3 instances, vacancies were advertised but were filled by people who had not responded to the public advertisement of the vacancies in question.  For completeness, I should say that one appointment was made by the North South Ministerial Council to an agency of a North South Implementation Body, on foot of the process by which such nominations are proposed on a 50:50 basis from each jurisdiction.</p></reply>
