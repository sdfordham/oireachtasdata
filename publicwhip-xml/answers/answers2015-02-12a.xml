However as no grants were paid, there is no liability attaching to the agreement with the IDA.  In all instances where financial assistance is approved by the IDA for a company, the Agency and the client enter into a legally binding contract, the terms of which must remain confidential. This company are not in breach of the terms of that contract. However it is not feasible to specify minimum operational periods, given the competitive market for Foreign Investment projects. </p>  <p>  The company had planned to increase employment to 30 staff in their new International Operations Centre over the next two to three years, and at the time of the closure announcement last month staff numbers had reached just nine.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately for the Irish operation, a recent change of strategic policy by the company, involving a restructuring of its worldwide operations, resulted in a decision that its European facilities would be consolidated in Amsterdam, where the company has a major Centre of Excellence.  Consequently a decision was made to close the Waterford operation by mid- year. </p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of Foreign Direct Investment projects secured by IDA Ireland remain here and, indeed, thrive in Ireland. Waterford is home to several major corporations which have embedded themselves in the local and national economy, with solid employment growth since their establishment. However, the strategic policy of multinationals sometimes means that decisions are made which involve a closure here, and unfortunately this has been the case with this company.</p></reply>

The indirect labour figure (agency/contract) is less clear. Given the number of companies competing for business, the cost of service delivery is a deciding factor in winning customers and forms part of the differentiation in terms of competing on cost to the customer.</p>  <p>  As in the case of many other service provision sectors characterised by internal competition, wage costs are an important component of overall costs. Consequently service providers who can reduce their wage costs obtain an initial competitive advantage over others.</p>  <p>  It appears that, for the majority of operators in the waste collection sector, many pay rates at or slightly above the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  Mindful that the need for proper compliance with legislation is in the workers and the wider public interest, I sought and received reports from the relevant Agencies under the aegis of my Department on the operation of the wider waste collection sector. These reports have been furnished. These Agencies included the National Employment Rights Authority, the Health and Safety Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the then National Consumer Agency and Competition Authority.</p>  <p>  These reports reflect significant engagement across health and safety, employment rights protection and input on customer service charters to the benefit of consumers. The Competition Authority, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, has worked with the Department of Environment Community and Local Government and other relevant agencies to determine full set of data required to facilitate comprehensive analysis of waste collection markets.  Following completion of an assessment of data currently available in relation to waste collection, the merged Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been engaging with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) and has set out the data considered necessary to undertake a meaningful study/analysis of competition in the household waste collection sector. </p></reply>

Earlier this week, I announced the appointment of the University of Limerick (UL) to carry out the study. The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.  The key objectives of the study are:<br/><br/>-  To fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<br/><br/>-  To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.<br/><br/>-  To enable the Minister to make any <i>evidence-based</i>policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<br/><br/>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, including the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors in particular. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular. <br/><br/>It is expected that a wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to the study, including employers and their representative bodies, employees and trade unions, relevant Government Departments and relevant state bodies. I expect the study to be completed within six months from commencement.</p></reply>

In addition, the Local Authorities made over 60 staff available to work in the 31 LEOS.<br/><br/>As a consequence, while there was a small number of retirements amongst staff of the LEOs during 2014<font color="#FF0000"> </font>there are in fact no LEO currently operating with fewer staff numbers than had been working in the CEBs on 14 April 2014, the last day of their operation prior to dissolution.<br/><br/>At present Enterprise Ireland, through their Centre of Excellence, is carrying out a comprehensive LEO Resources Survey the purpose of which is not just to establish the full headcount (part-time and full-time, including the additional Local Authority staff) working in each LEO but to also establish the skills and strengths of those staff and to establish any skills gaps or deficits that need to be addressed in the context of LEO staff training to be delivered by Enterprise Ireland.<br/><br/>In addition, I should also point out that the Public Appointments Service has recently advertised a competition to fill a number of Head of Enterprise positions in LEOs and a new LEO Graduate placement programme to strengthen customer service was launched last December which will result in an additional 25 graduates being recruited for a 2-year placement with the LEOs from the end of Quarter 1 2015.</p></reply>

I understand that the budget allocation for the LEO Tipperary for 2015, which is anticipated will be in the region of the 2014 allocation, is due to be agreed by Enterprise Ireland shortly. In 2013 &euro;18.5 million was allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, a similar budget was allocated in 2014. On Wednesday I announced details of an additional competitive funding stream of &euro;5 million for the Local Enterprise Offices to seek additional resources for innovative new projects.<br/><br/>Formal job creation targets were not a feature of the operation of the CEBs at the time. However, one of the major elements of the reform of the CEB structure that I implemented was the development of a set of rigorous performance metrics for the LEOs.<br/><br/>The LEO Tipperary is expected to develop specific targets for these metrics, in conjunction with EI, as part of their annual Local Enterprise Development Plan (LEDP) for 2014. The LEDP for Tipperary for 2015 is currently being prepared and it is expected that the Plan and associated targets will be available through the local enterprise website at shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-12a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021200052#WRA01900"><p>I fully appreciate the concerns of retired and deferred members of pension schemes whose schemes are being restructured, particularly where such restructuring may impact on existing or potential pension benefits.</p>  <p>  The question of whether it is appropriate that pensioner groups have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which I have given careful consideration, particularly in light of representations made to me in this regard. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also consulted with the industrial relations bodies under the auspices of my Department on the issues that arise in the context of collective representation of retired and deferred members of pension schemes in such circumstances. </p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to stress that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. </p>  <p>  As it stands, active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Any proposed changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within this framework that a collective approach would be most effective.</p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are already required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members on an individual basis in any proposals they make.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has been considering the issue of collective representation for pensioners and deferred members of occupational pension schemes with the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Arising from this exercise, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority and signed regulations on January 22nd to provide for the recognition of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Pensions Authority has published the revised section 50 guidance.</p>  <p>  I understand that the changes apply in the following situations:</p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme will now be required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority will now be required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to its proposals to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme. In such situations, the representative group will also have the option of making an appeal to the high Court on a point of law in relation to such proposals.</p>  <p>  On a separate but related matter, I am currently considering the introduction of access rights for individual retired workers to the industrial relations machinery of the State under the Industrial Relations Acts, where they have not referred their claim prior to their retirement.</p></reply>

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<br/><br/>Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs </i>for 2013 and 2014.<br/><br/>Developing Manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.</i>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 </i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start‐up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. <br/><br/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available). The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy have shown significant growth in employment in recent years. <br/><br/>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies especially in the manufacturing and services companies, with consequent job creation and retention, and several recent new job announcements have been in respect of companies engaged in these sectors.Just last week I officiated at the Combilift announcement which will bring 200 new skilled jobs to County Monaghan, and at the announcement of the provision of 100 services jobs in the SalesSense operation in Dundalk.  On Monday last I helped launch the Lakeland Dairies initiative in County Cavan which will provide an additional 81 jobs in their new milk processing facility.  The three initiatives are great examples of regional job creation. <br/><br/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies. <br/><br/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority. <br/><br/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the Manufacturing and Services sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.  <br/><br/>I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres. For this reason I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the South East region, which has traditionally very high levels of unemployment has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 19.4% to 13.7% in the last 2 years alone. The overall National Unemployment rate continues to fall and now stands at 10.5%, a dramatic improvement on the position which pertained just a few years ago after this Government took office.</p></reply>

It is my understanding that discussions between the company (J&amp;J) and a private investment entity are currently on-going. IDA Ireland has asked J&amp;J to connect them with the new owner and the company has committed to do so at an appropriate time. IDA Ireland is prepared to work with the new owners to try to deliver high value sustainable jobs for Cashel.  I&rsquo;m sure that the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.  In County Tipperary as a whole there are 11 IDA Ireland client companies employing 3,370 people in full and part time employment. Cashel, located as it is in South Tipperary, is marketed by IDA Ireland as part of the South East Region, along with the counties of Waterford, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny. The main clusters which have emerged in the South East are high value manufacturing (pharmaceutical, medical devices and engineering) and International Financial Services.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on 29th January.  This is the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process, which started in 2012.  When the First Action Plan for Jobs was launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.  Today it stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.</p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Yesterday, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.</p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p></reply>

The initiative sees Irish design and designers being celebrated and promoted here in Ireland and internationally through a year-long programme of activity.  With a global reach, it aims to create 1800 jobs and 200 new businesses by promoting Ireland as a hub for design excellence and by encouraging investment in design as a key component of competitiveness and innovation.  ID2015 presents a comprehensive programme of over 300 Irish and international events exploring, promoting and celebrating Irish design in just about every form. As part of ID2015, Dublin has been designated World Design Hub 2015 by the International Association of Designers, providing Ireland with a platform to promote the skills and talents of Irish designers to a worldwide audience.</p>  <p>  Highlights of the programme include:</p>  <p>  -  Ireland&rsquo;s largest international trade fair Showcase: Ireland&rsquo;s Creative Expo &reg; took place in Dublin in January, attracting over 5000 buyers from Ireland and up to 26 countries and generated up to &euro;20 million in sales orders.</p>  <p>  -  The work of 20 Irish designers and makers was presented in an Irish Design pavilion at the premier French tradeshow Maison et Objet which took place in Paris during the last week in January.</p>  <p>  -  Design Island, a new photographic exhibition at Dublin Airport celebrating Irish creativity as part of ID2015, will be seen by more than 21 million passengers by the end of 2015.  Design Island features a series of 300 photographs by award winning Irish photographer Peter Rowen capturing 24 designers and craft practitioners at work in their studios all over Ireland.</p>  <p>  -  To coincide with ID2015, Ireland has been announced as the inaugural Focus Country for the London Festival of Architecture, which takes place during the month of June 2015, presenting the work of 5 Irish practices working in the architecture and built environment sector.</p>  <p>  -  The Coach House at Dublin Castle will be a design hub for ID2015, showcasing Irish and international design exhibitions from partners including Design Museum London and Vitra Design Museum, Germany.  The current exhibition, In the Making, has travelled from the Design Museum in London.</p>  <p>  -  Throughout the year, the work of Irish designers will be presented at international events such as Milan and Dutch Design Weeks, London Festival of Architecture, London and Paris Fashion Weeks, London Design Festival, Chicago Architecture Biennial and Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism/Architecture in Hong Kong/Shenzhen.</p>  <p>  -  In its programme of overseas trade missions, as well as at the above international events, Enterprise Ireland will develop opportunities to promote Irish design and design companies.</p>  <p>  Highlights in the coming weeks include:</p>  <p>  -  Ireland&rsquo;s inaugural participation in the International Fashion Showcase during London Fashion Week will see the work of 8 emerging Irish designers presented during the festival, from 20 - 24 February.</p>  <p>  -  In partnership with ID2015 &ldquo;Better Business by Design&rdquo;, the IBEC 2015 Annual CEO Conference, will take place in Dublin Castle on 4th March, featuring international and national keynote speakers who will stimulate debate and provide fresh insights into creative confidence and innovation.</p>  <p>  In addition, funding opportunities have been included in the programme.  A Design Innovation Fund will see the initiation of a diverse range of projects such as workshops, conferences and events which will have a strategic impact on the development of supports for design companies and SMEs.  An International Trade Fund will also enable Irish designers and companies to access international markets and create export opportunities.</p></reply>

Under Action Plan for Jobs 2015, which I recently launched, it is intended to develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies, based on consultation with key stakeholders at regional level over the coming months.  I expect that these strategies, and the consultation that underpins them, will be reflected in the Local Economic and Community Plans.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is the agency under my aegis with responsibility for the development of Irish enterprise, deepening Ireland&rsquo;s footprint in world markets, and supporting employment creation in our economy. It is expected that the local economic and community plans will take account of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s own regional strategies. Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland do not have a formal consultative role but will be inputting to all of the local economic and community plans.</p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), established in April last year, combine the functions of the former County Enterprise Boards and the Business Development expertise of the Local Authorities.

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  The Action Plan process is working. Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. This increase has not been in &ldquo;precarious&rdquo; or temporary jobs.  While the proportion of Irish workers who are on temporary contracts rose slightly during the recession, reaching 10.5% in 2011, it has since fallen back to the pre-recession level of 9.5%, and remains significantly below the EU average of 14.4%. The CSO data for January 2015 indicates that the share of casual and part-time workers on the Live Register was down -11.0% on January 2014, equivalent to 8,873 workers. The cumulative decrease is 15,839 workers since January 2013. </p>  <p>  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels. Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.6 per cent at end 2014. In 2014, client companies of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland created 8,476 and 7,131 net new jobs respectively; this represents the highest levels of net new job creation by agency client companies in over a decade and most of this employment growth was in full-time employment. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will be a further step along the way in meeting this medium-term goal for Ireland. The themes in this year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship and in fostering new sources of growth for the economy.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan contains a suite of 380 actions to ensure we deliver the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, with the target to create 40,000 jobs this year. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.</p>  <p>  Existing legislation states that part-time employees may not be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee unless there are objective reasons for such treatment, provides specific protection for employees on zero hours contracts, and provides rights regarding equality of treatment to temporary agency workers, many of whom may be part-time workers.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of jobs created in tandem with the APJ process have been full-time and well paid. Nevertheless we are anxious to better understand instances where this is not the case.  In this regard, the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015 firstly sets commitments to establish the Low Pay Commission, which is to undertake analysis and make a recommendation on the appropriate level of the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  Secondly, under the APJ, my Department has commissioned the University of Limerick a study on the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts (contracts of 8 hours or less per week (LHC) among Irish employers and their impact on employees, and make policy recommendations to Government. The team from the Department of Personnel and Employment Relations in the Kemmy School of Business in UL is expected to report back within six months with its findings and also recommendations for policy change, should they be warranted. </p>  <p>  All sectors of the economy are expected to come within the scope of the study; however, a particular focus will be on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors. The study is expected to cover both the public and private sectors.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, the global IDA team and Enterprise Ireland coordinate their work to seek a new occupier for the former factory, and to highlight the skills-base of the affected workforce.  In the case of some recent significant job losses in regional centres, I have arranged that the key State players immediately come together to coordinate the State&rsquo;s response to the closure. Such a group would usually include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, DSP, Solas, Education and Training Board, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and relevant Local Authority.<br/><br/>For individuals seeking to start their own business, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop service in providing information to anyone seeking to develop a business idea. The LEOs can provide information and guidance on all the supports across the Government system. The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training, and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, particularly following a company closure when affected employees are seeking an alternative source of employment. Contact details for the LEOs are available at .<br/><br/>A protocol agreement is in place between the enterprise development agencies and the Department of Social Protection (DSP) as part of the <i>&lsquo;Pathways to Work&rsquo;</i>initiative.  This sets out a number of mechanisms designed to enhance co-operation between the agencies and DSP. This arrangement includes:<br/><br/>-  Active marketing of DSP supports and incentives to client companies,<br/><br/>-  Sharing information about project announcements,<br/><br/>-  Organising specific events around the services and incentives available to hire unemployed people.<br/><br/>If relevant, the services of NERA, the State Employment Rights body, are at the disposal of the workers concerned if employment rights issues need to be pursued.<br/><br/>Finally, with regard to Regional Enterprise Development, under the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs which I launched recently, it is intended to develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies, based on consultation with key stakeholders at regional level and on the analysis of the strengths of each region.  The process will commence with the publication of strategies for the Midlands and South East regions. Similar strategies for the other regions will be commenced over the course of the year on a phased basis. All strategies will include specific actions for all the enterprise development organisations and other public bodies active in each region, to promote enterprise growth and job creation. I expect to launch the Strategy for the Midlands in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As a result of the review of the Scheme and on foot of immediate concerns raised by the Credit Review Office, Business Representative Organisations and the banks, I have decided to take urgent action to assist SMEs whose banks have left or are leaving the Irish SME lending market. </p>  <p>  This will see a new CGS 2015 made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 which will allow guarantees for refinancing loans where an SME's bank has exited or is exiting the Irish SME market. This new Scheme will also increase the maximum length of guarantees under the CGS from 3 years to 7 years. </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials are in the process of finalising the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill which is on the A list of the spring legislative programme.  This Bill will see further enhancements to the CGS on foot of the review process including: extending a wider range of financial products to be covered not just traditional credit products (e.g. invoice finance, factoring, leasing, overdrafts); a wider range of providers of financial product to be eligible, i.e. not just banks who hold a licence under the Central Bank Act 1971; an increase in the level of guarantee on individual loans from 75% to 80%; an increase in the portfolio cap, i.e. the maximum a bank can claim in respect of its portfolio from 10% to 13%; and the removal of the annual portfolio cap and instead each bank will run a single Credit Guarantee Scheme portfolio.  These changes will make the CGS much more attractive to businesses. </p>  <p>  The progress of the CGS is being continuously monitored and my Department places quarterly reports on its website. </p>  <p>  As of close of business on 30 January 2015 there are 118 live CGS facilities resulting in &euro;15.6m being approved through the CGS.  In addition a further 14 CGS loans have been repaid for over &euro;1.8million.</p>  <p>  As a result of these live and repaid CGS facilities for SMEs it is expected that there will be 650 new jobs created and 340 jobs will be maintained.</p></reply>

While employment has increased nationally by approximately 80,000 since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery.</p>  <p>  That is the reason why the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs which was published on 29th January includes a commitment to develop and publish a suite of Regional Enterprise Strategies to support enterprise growth and job creation in every region of the country.  These Strategies will include a series of specific actions to be delivered by a range of public bodies and local stakeholders, building on the particular strengths and assets of each region. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in April last year, my Department reformed the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises. The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are a core instrument of local enterprise support and development for micro and small enterprises, and are the first stop shop through which all information on State supports for small and micro-businesses can be accessed. </p>  <p>  One of the key elements arising from the reform is the requirement for each LEO to prepare an annual Local Enterprise Development Plan. These plans will include targets for key activities, initiatives to support enterprise and job creation in each area, as well as wider economic impacts such as exports, mentoring, training and enterprise promotion. It is expected that this reform will continue the momentum for entrepreneurship and sustained growth in job creation in each county and region across the country. </p>  <p>  In relation to Enterprise Ireland, the agency&rsquo;s client companies have continued to generate increased jobs growth, recording the highest overall rise in employment levels in the last decade, with 8,476 net new jobs at the end of 2014. EI clients now provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers across all regions.  These employment levels are the highest recorded by indigenous companies in the last decade. As a consequence, EI companies are responsible for more than 300,000 (direct and indirect) jobs throughout the regions of Ireland. Specifically, in 2014, there was a net gain of 1,550 EI supported jobs in County Cork and a net gain of 79 EI supported jobs in County Kerry. For Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, there was a net gain of 181 jobs, 73 jobs and 96 jobs respectively.</p>  <p>  According to the 2014 Annual Employment Survey, there has been no decline in IDA Ireland client employment in the West (Galway, Mayo) or South West (Cork, Kerry) Regions.

Comprehensive discussions were had in all 3 areas of the negotiations; Market Access, Regulatory Cooperation and the Rules, which includes trade facilitation, intellectual property, sustainable development, labour, the environment and SMEs.  ISDS or investment protection was not discussed.The <b>Market Access</b>discussions focused on tariffs, services and public procurement.  Discussions in <b>the Regulatory </b>area were around the proposals tabled by both sides on regulatory cooperation, technical barriers to trade i.e. standards and conformity assessment and sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures (SPS). The regulatory cooperation text was tabled by the EU and is available on the EU Commission website: <br/><br/>The main elements of the EU text are good regulatory practices and enhanced regulatory cooperation. Negotiators are discussing ways to establish a good system of cooperation between the US and EU regulators in a manner that does not compromise standards on either side of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>  Discussions on the <b>Rules</b>area included sustainable development, labour and the environment. Both the EU and the US believe in the protection of workers&rsquo; rights and in the protection of the environment. Negotiators stated that they are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome.  Also discussed were trade facilitation, intellectual property, state to state dispute settlement, rules or origin, energy and raw materials and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).<br/><br/>  During the 8<sup>th</sup>round the negotiating teams spent one day meeting and hearing from over 400 civil society representatives from business and industry, professional associations, consumer bodies, environmental groups and the labour movement. <br/><br/>  Turning to Regulatory Cooperation, the EU and US work closely already in a number of areas. Air transport is one example of where common standards for safety and technical requirements are already in place.  The EU and the US have also agreed to recognise each other&rsquo;s organic food standards.  The TTIP proposes to extend this to other areas such as cars, medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  The objective is to avoid duplication and to find ways to make our systems work more smoothly. <br/><br/>  Regulatory compatibility and cooperation is not about deregulation. Rather it recognises the realities of globalisation and will make the trading landscape easier and more predictable. This will be particularly important in unlocking the potential for SMEs and in helping them to internationalise and grow exports.</p></reply>

Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our Science Technology and Innovation investment is paying off.  While is it not possible to fully disaggregate the contribution of Innovation and Technology to job creation, all the evidence is that it is very significant, as Ireland moves up the value chain and exploits our competitive position in knowledge based activity.  In particular, a number of EU and international indicators illustrate this.  Ireland is ranked:<br/><br/>-  11<sup>th</sup>in the Global Innovation Index 2014 (out of 142 countries)<br/><br/>-  15<sup>th</sup>in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2014 (up 2 places from 2013)<br/><br/>-  3<sup>rd</sup>in the EU &lsquo;Indictor of Innovation Output&rsquo; (September 2013)<br/><br/>-  9<sup>th</sup>in the European Commission&rsquo;s 2014 Innovation Union Scoreboard.<br/><br/>The availability of European research programmes provides Ireland with valuable mechanisms for firms &ndash; indigenous and multinational - to engage in high-level international research to further their innovativeness and competitiveness.  These programmes are also a critical source of non-Exchequer funding for this important economic activity. <br/><br/>The current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, which is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, is Horizon 2020 (H2020), which has a budget of close to &euro;80bn. and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies who compete successfully for funding from this large research funding resource will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn this will deliver strong national economic impacts.<br/><br/>Ireland performed excellently in the previous Framework Programme 7 (FP7) where over &euro;620m. was awarded to Irish companies and academics. We have set ourselves an ambitious target of winning &euro;1.25bn under H2020.<br/><br/>Our strategy to achieve our H2020 target is being driven by the H2020 High Level Group, chaired by my Department.  All Departments and Agencies engaged in research funding are represented on the High Level Group.<br/><br/>The H2020 national support system is based in Enterprise Ireland and through a national office and a network of national contact points in the relevant programme areas of H2020, information and support is available to enterprise and researchers to facilitate their engagement with the opportunities available under H2020.<br/><br/>Concerning the Youth Guarantee Scheme, this falls under the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

According to assessments made by the European Commission and other European bodies, a comprehensive TTIP could over time boost the EU's GDP by 0.5% per annum, resulting in 400,000 additional jobs across the EU.  Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 118,000 people employed in 585 US companies here.  The total level of trade (imports and exports) between Ireland and the US in 2012 was &euro;55 billion.  The US is Ireland biggest merchandise export market.  The most recent data from the CSO shows that Ireland&rsquo;s services exports to the US increased by 40% in 2012.  Notwithstanding the present high level of trade significant benefits could be derived from a comprehensive and ambitious TTIP.<br/><br/>My Department commissioned Copenhagen Economics to carry out a study on the potential impact of the TTIP for Ireland. This study is intended to assist in guiding the Irish position in the negotiations.  The study is expected to be finalised shortly and published in early 2015.<br/><br/>The initial findings by Copenhagen Economics show that the benefit to Ireland would be more than double the EU average, with 1.1% added to GDP.  Other preliminary findings include increased exports (2.7%), increases in real wages (1.4%) and investment (1.6%).  Opportunities are expected mainly in manufacturing &ndash; pharmaceutical and chemical industry, electrical machinery and other advanced machinery; services &ndash; insurance and ICT and Agriculture and processed foods.<br/><br/>On 7 January, 2015, the EU Commission published a number of documents, all of which can be found at .<br/><br/>Included in the published documents are some of the EU&rsquo;s proposals for legal text in the TTIP that have been tabled for discussion with the US.  The areas covered by the texts published are competition, food safety and animal and plant health, customs issues, technical barriers to trade, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and government-to-government dispute settlement. The EU Commission also published EU position papers explaining the EU's approach in the areas of engineering, vehicles, and sustainable development.<br/><br/>I very much welcome this openness and transparency by the Commission.<br/><br/>As regards investment protection in the TTIP, the EU Commission published its report on the results of its public consultation on 13 January, 2015.  The report, along with explanatory material, can be found at .<br/><br/>The Commission has indicated that, based on the comments received, there are a number of areas that appear to be particularly important to respondents, which represent four areas of work that should be explored further.  These are: the protection of the right to regulate; the establishment and functioning of arbitral tribunals; the relationship between domestic judicial systems and Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS); and the review of ISDS decisions for legal correctness through an appellate mechanism.  The EU Commission has stated that, in the first quarter of 2015, it will be discussing the report with Member States and the European Parliament, and with different stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations, business, trade unions, consumer and environment organisations. The Commission has indicated that, following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations.<br/><br/>I very much welcome this approach, and I believe that it is important to take time to have open and constructive discussion following the Commission&rsquo;s report that will inform the next steps.<br/><br/>At this stage, there are no negotiations taking place with the United States on investment protection.<br/><br/>As regards the other areas of policy mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the EU Commission has already said that there will be no reduction in the EU&rsquo;s high standards in health and safety.

The question of whether it is appropriate that pensioner groups have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which I have given careful consideration, particularly in light of representations made to me in this regard.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also consulted with the industrial relations bodies under the auspices of my Department on the issues that arise in the context of collective representation of retired and deferred members of pension schemes in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to stress that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations.</p>  <p>  As it stands, active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Any proposed changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules/deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within this framework that a collective approach would be most effective.</p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are already required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members on an individual basis in any proposals they make.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has been considering the issue of collective representation for pensioners and deferred members of occupational pension schemes with the Pensions Authority.</p>  <p>  Arising from this exercise, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority and signed regulations on January 22nd to provide for the recognition of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a pension scheme.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Pensions Authority has published the revised section 50 guidance.</p>  <p>  I understand that the changes apply in the following situations:</p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme will now be required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority will now be required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to its proposals to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme. In such situations, the representative group will also have the option of making an appeal to the high Court on a point of law in relation to such proposals.</p></reply>

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.  Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs </i>for 2013 and 2014.  Developing manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.</i>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 </i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start-up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment.<br/><br/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available).<br/><br/>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies in the manufacturing sector, with consequent job creation and retention, and several recent new job announcements have been in respect of companies engaged in this sector.  Just last week I officiated at the Combilift announcement which will bring 200 new skilled jobs to County Monaghan.  On Monday last I helped launch the Lakeland Dairies initiative in County Cavan which will provide an additional 81 jobs in their new milk processing facility.  The two initiatives are great examples of regional job creation.<br/><br/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies.<br/><br/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority.<br/><br/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in the Manufacturing sector. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.<br/><br/>I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres. For this reason I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the South East region, which has traditionally very high levels of unemployment has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 19.4% to 13.7% in the last 2 years alone. The overall National Unemployment rate continues to fall and now stands at 10.5% a dramatic improvement on the position which pertained just a few years ago after this Government took office.</p></reply>

Actions to be taken in 2015 which will contribute to the competitiveness of the sector include the continued roll-out of Trading On-Line Vouchers to 2,000 businesses, examining the options to enhance the skills profile of the sector, and a review of the 2012 Forf&aacute;s report on business licences with a view to identifying further actions which can be taken to reduce the administrative burden on the Retail sector.</p>  <p>  Through the Retail Consultation Forum, which is chaired by the Minister for Business and Employment, Ged Nash, T.D., we will continue to identify actions that can be taken to help improve competitiveness and support increased employment in the sector.</p></reply>

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  The Action Plan process is working. Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. The CSO data for January 2015 indicates that the number of persons aged 25 on the Live Register and under has fallen to 13.7% from 15.1% in January 2014, a reduction of 11,248 over the year.  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels. Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th according to the IMD. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.5 per cent in January 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p>  <p>  While it is the Pathways to Work strategy that focuses on specific measures to improve employment opportunities for young persons, the steps taken to date under previous Action Plans, and those set out for this year, complement that work and directly assist young job seekers.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs commits to implementing the 70 actions in Pathways to Work 2015. These include beginning the new account management approach to employers, roll-out JobPath, continuing to roll-out the Youth Guarantee initiatives, and introduce a Back to Work Family Dividend. In addition, as part of Pathways to Work, a new JobsPlus strand for young people will be available in 2015 under the Youth Guarantee. Since its launch in the summer of 2013, over 2,500 employers have availed of the opportunity to give over 3,400 unemployed people on the Live Register a chance to get back into employment.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January 2014.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, were launched in November 2014 after the required legislation was passed in June 2014.  Passage of the legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed. Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015.  Potential refinement of these models may be considered on the basis of outcomes and learning from Youth Guarantee Pilot Project in Ballymun.</p>  <p>  We will continue to focus on improvement in skills provision through the provision of programmes for a diverse range of individuals including young unemployed people through the Education and Training Boards in the implementation of the Further Education Strategy 2014-2018, the Momentum programmes, the recent launch of the fifth iteration of Springboard, offering short higher education courses for jobseekers with previous work experience, employment incentive schemes such as JobsPlus and doubling of high-end skills as part of the second ICT Skills Action Plan. The launch of the call for new apprenticeships should provide further opportunities for young people to find rewarding careers for the future. The HEA will also support the use of third level facilities out of term to promote greater awareness and interest in technology, science and engineering among young people.</p>  <p>  In the areas of entrepreneurship, the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices provides a first-stop-shop for young entrepreneurs with an idea or interested in starting a business and we will build on the success of &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition which was launched in 2014.</p></reply>

The Commission have reported solid progress in all 3 areas of the Agreement, Market Access, Regulatory Cooperation and the Rules, which includes trade facilitation, intellectual property, sustainable development, labour, the environment and SMEs.  The Market Access discussions focused on tariffs, services and public procurement.  These discussions have allowed both sides to better understand each sides priorities and sensitivities.<br/><br/>Discussions in the Regulatory area were around the proposals tabled by both sides on regulatory cooperation, technical barriers to trade i.e. standards and conformity assessment and sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures (SPS).  A regulatory cooperation text was tabled by the EU and is available on the EU Commission website.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The main elements of the EU text are good regulatory practices and enhanced regulatory cooperation.  Negotiators are discussing ways establish a good system of cooperation between the US and EU regulators in a manner that does not compromise individual Member States right to regulate.<br/><br/>Discussions on the Rules area included sustainable development and labour and the environment.  Both the EU and the US believe in the protection of workers&rsquo; rights and on protection of the environment and negotiators are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome which goes beyond what has been done so far in trade agreements.  Also discussed were had on trade facilitation, intellectual property, state to state dispute settlement, rules or origin, energy and raw materials and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).<br/><br/>During the 8<sup>th</sup>round the negotiating teams spend one day meeting and hearing from over 400 civil society representatives from business and industry, professional associations, consumer bodies, environmental groups and the labour movement.</p></reply>

The most recent Forum &ndash; the third since 2009 &ndash; was held in October 2013.  The themes discussed at the 2013 Forum were closely aligned with the Action Plan for Jobs and the event was structured to capture practical ideas that could be taken forward through the Action Plan process.  Working Groups in the Forum addressed issues such as driving innovative manufacturing, developing a supportive culture for entrepreneurship, tackling youth unemployment, as well as looking at the potential of sectors such as financial services, technology, tourism and Agri-food.</p>  <p>  I, along with senior officials from my Department participated on a various Working Groups at the Forum.  A number of ideas which emerged from the 2013 Forum were included in the 2014 and 2015 Action Plans for Jobs.  These include:</p>  <p>  - Designating 2015 as the Year of Irish Design; the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs includes a series of actions to grow sales through leadership in design.</p>  <p>  - Focusing on driving a step change in Manufacturing; this was a key Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Action Plan and, in 2015, the IDA will launch a new &euro;1.5 million programme to support transformation and productivity improvement in the sector.</p>  <p>  - Building on the theme of Entrepreneurship, a National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship was published last year as part of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs process.</p>  <p>  Other actions included in the Action Plans which emerged from the Global Irish Economic Forum include the appointment of &ldquo;Origin Green&rdquo; ambassadors in the Food sector and a focus on the opportunities from Smart Ageing.

As the Deputy is aware, resource constraints and the economic downturn nationally and globally meant that, de facto, in recent years policy has been focused mainly around five core strategic policies: - Prioritisation of public funds into areas of research that offer most potential for economic recovery and social progress;<br/><br/>- Consolidation of resources in units of scale with scientific excellence, <br/><br/>- Increased collaboration between academia and industry; and between academic and research performing institutions; <br/><br/>- International collaboration, to maximise return on investment and to optimise success under EU Framework programmes; and<br/><br/>- Facilitating the translation of knowledge and the transfer of technology into jobs. <br/><br/>It is now timely to place Research Prioritisation and the focus on research relevance and impact within a broader context and to develop and articulate a vision for science policy.  An Interdepartmental Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation is working towards formulating the new Strategy. The new Strategy will seek to, inter alia:<br/><br/>- embed Research Prioritisation as a key policy objective to ensure a continued focus on public funding of research in areas of economic relevance to enterprise;<br/><br/>- maintain and build further the capacity and capability of people in academia and in enterprise through the acquisition and transfer of knowledge and in doing so, support excellent and impactful research across the full continuum from basic to applied as well as commercialisation of research;<br/><br/>- maintain and build further relevant infrastructures across all the sciences but in particular in areas of economic relevance to the enterprise base to address the jobs crisis;<br/><br/>- build on consolidation of the system by further enhancing its coherence and its accessibility to enterprise and society.<br/><br/>A consultation paper which serves as a scene setter and which poses key questions that need to be addressed in a new Strategy is being circulated this week to key stakeholders to seek their views.  I expect to publish the new Strategy by Summer 2015.</p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  While IDA Ireland always seeks to influence the client decisions on where to visit or where to locate, the final decision in all cases is made by the investor.</p>  <p>  Limerick, along with Clare and North Tipperary, forms part of IDA&rsquo;s Mid-West region. Within that region, IDA Ireland concentrates its efforts on the Limerick/Shannon gateway and the hub town of Ennis.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county are being developed.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2014, there were 48 IDA Ireland supported companies in Co. Limerick employing 7,906 people in full time and part time employment.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites. The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland are from the existing client base.</p>  <p>  To date in 2015, two announcements were made for Limerick and Shannon.  ViaGoGo announced a 100 person expansion of their operations in Limerick and in addition, Amax Shannon also announced a 100 person expansion of its Global and Logistics Operations.</p>  <p>  There were a number of other IDA announcements for Limerick during 2014 including ViaGoGo (100 jobs), Optel Vision (140 jobs) Filtertek (35 jobs) and Johnson and Johnson (100 jobs).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched recently.  This is the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process, which started in 2012.  When the First Action Plan for Jobs was launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.  Today it stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.</p>  <p>  We are determined that every region will benefit from the recovery and we will be announcing over the coming weeks and months a series of actions to help drive the achievement of this goal.</p></reply>

There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015.<br/><br/>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords for the provision of short term support. <br/><br/>It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. <br/><br/>Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from this Department to housing authorities. Under this scheme, HAP payments will be made directly to landlords by the housing authorities. HAP is currently being rolled out to selected housing authorities, with some 790 HAP recipients currently. There is a target to achieve 8,400 HAP cases in 2015 as set out in the &ldquo;Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform&rdquo;. The Department continues to support the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and housing authorities to ensure the success of the HAP scheme. </p></reply>

To become a voluntary contributor a person must:</p>  <p>  - have paid at least 468 weeks PRSI (since 6 April 2014) in either employment or self-employment,</p>  <p>  - apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which he/she last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution,</p>  <p>  - agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which he/she leaves compulsory insurance.</p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor on or after 6 April 2015 a person must have previously paid 520 weeks PRSI.</p>  <p>  The annual voluntary contribution charge for the self-employed is a special flat rate payment of &euro;500.  The payment of voluntary contributions allows the self-employed to maintain their PRSI record and qualify for State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s contributory pension and guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory).</p>  <p>  In addition self-employed persons who have lost their business and become unemployed or suffer from an illness, may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.</p>  <p>  Since 2011 there has been a number of significant measures undertaken which have enhanced the prevention and detection of social welfare fraud.  These measures commenced as part of  the Fraud Initiative (2011 &ndash; 2013) and are being further progressed under the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018, which I launched in April 2014.  The Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy builds on the approaches that have been successfully rolled out over the past couple of years.  These include the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card, enhanced data sharing with other Government Departments and Agencies and a number of significant legislative measures. </p>  <p>  The emphasis continues to be on preventing fraud and error from entering the system in the first place.   However, where fraud is discovered it is important that there are appropriate sanctions in place.  In this regard, the Department is proactively targeting persons with overpayments to ensure all persons who have a social welfare overpayment are making a contribution towards the repayment of the debt outstanding.  A number of legislative provisions have been introduced to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to recover debt and, in addition, a new debt management system went live in November 2014.  It is also the Department's policy to consider for prosecution cases of fraud against the social welfare system.</p>  <p>  The Department recognises that fraud investigation and control can be assisted through the application of a range of new technologies.  In this context, the Department has recently commenced a project utilising analytics technology to predict which claims are more likely to be fraudulent.  When this technology is in place, it will enable the Department to target higher risk cases for investigation and to do so faster.  </p>  <p>  A number of other measures should also be noted. From the beginning of Dec 2014, 20 Garda&iacute; have been seconded to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers will ensure a greater presence on the ground and will increase the investigative capacity of the Department to prevent, detect and deter social welfare fraud. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would increase by this amount over time.  The control savings target for 2014 was &euro;510 million and it will be maintained at this level for 2015.</p>  <p>  Fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced in recent years and are subject to continuing review.  Overall, this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.</p></reply>

It is paid to more than 600,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2014. It is paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years in line with the statutory school attendance age. <br/><br/>It is important to emphasise that the payment continues to be paid for children up to their 18<sup>th</sup>birthday who are in full-time education or who have a disability. <br/><br/>Budget 2009 provided for the reduction of the age for which child benefit is paid from 19 years to 18 years.  A Value for Money Review of Child Income Support Programmes found that the participation pattern in second-level education supports the 18-year age limit for child benefit. For families on low incomes there are a number of provisions to social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:<br/><br/>- qualified child increases (QCIs) with primary social welfare payments<br/><br/>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children<br/><br/>- The back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families.<br/><br/>Therefore, I have no plans to make any changes to the age threshold for child benefit.  <br/><br/>Budget 2015 increased child benefit by &euro;5, from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month or &euro;60 per annum. In addition, the new Back to Work Family Dividend for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children and One Parent Family Payment recipients will enable these families to retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.<br/><br/>These measures recognise the sacrifices that families made during the economic crisis and their continuing difficulties. They are in line with the commitment in the <i>Statement of Government Priorities</i>for a new deal on living standards for hard-pressed families. Strategically, the measures will increase the pace of the progress in helping people back to work, boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves.</p></reply>

In 2014, it was paid to almost 1.2 million children in more than 600,000 families, with a total estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion. </p>  <p>  In 2014, child benefit was paid to an average 7,577 non-resident children in 4,728 families, at an estimated cost of &euro;11.82 million. The cost represents less than 1% of the total child benefit expenditure. The 2013 figures are similar:  an average 7,707 non-resident children in 4,819 families, at a cost of &euro;12 million. </p>  <p>  The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009.  These regulations are designed to co-ordinate the social security systems of the various Member States so that people and their families are not disadvantaged when they move within the EU. A key principle of the coordination system is that persons moving to different Member States are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits as the nationals of those Member States. </p>  <p>  The Irish child benefit payment is classified as a family benefit for the purposes of these coordination rules and the payment of these benefits are governed by specific rules set out in the regulations.  EU nationals who come to work in Ireland, and who pay social insurance contributions, are entitled to receive child benefit in respect of their children, even if the children reside in another EU Member State. The equality provisions of the regulations require that these payments are made at the same rate and under the same conditions as apply to a person whose family is resident in Ireland. As in many areas of EU legislation, national legislation is effectively constrained in how it treats Irish nationals or residents against those from other member states.</p>  <p>  Changes to EU legislation to modify child benefit entitlements in respect of non-resident children requires the agreement of the EU Commission, as any proposals for amendments must be tabled by the Commission itself.</p></reply>

It will give financial support to people with children who were getting jobseeker and one-parent family payments and who take up employment, increase their hours of employment or become self-employed. </p>  <p>  The BTWFD provides support for up to two years after a person moves from social welfare into employment. If a person qualifies for the dividend they will get a weekly payment equivalent of any increases for qualified children that were being paid on their jobseeker or one-parent family payment, up to a maximum of 4 children, for the first year in employment. Half that amount will be paid weekly for their second year in employment. Where payable the dividend will be additional to any entitlement the family may have under the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.</p>  <p>The BTWFD scheme will commence when the necessary legislation, to be advanced under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015, is in place. However applications are currently being accepted. These will be processed following the progression of the legislation and all eligible claims will be backdated to their date of application. This means that eligible applicants from the 5th   of January, 2015 to the date of commencement of the scheme will receive arrears of BTWFD and their 2 year period of entitlement, subject to scheme criteria, will run from their date of application.</p></reply>

By reducing the likelihood of deflation, this should help support consumer spending and investment.<br/><br/>Ireland should benefit from quantitative easing (QE) in a number of ways:<br/><br/>- Through improved financing conditions for households and firms; <br/><br/>- By raising demand in the euro area, Ireland s single largest export destination;<br/><br/>- Through the depreciation of the currency which improves the competitiveness of Irish exports outside the euro area;<br/><br/>- Through the restoration of price stability which will help reduce the real debt burden.<br/><br/>My Department will publish updated economic forecasts in April taking account of the impact of QE.<br/><br/>And while QE will likely be beneficial for the Irish economy, there is nevertheless the possibility of side effects such as increased asset prices. <br/><br/>In this regard, I would point out that Capital Gains Tax applies on any chargeable gain from the disposal of many assets, including non-principal private residences and to equity gains. Stamp Duty also applies to the purchase of assets such as property and shares. Therefore, in the event of increases in asset values, there would be a proportionate increase in the tax paid. <br/><br/>Finally, I would point out that all tax rates and regimes are held under continuous review by my Department and that any changes are made in the context of the annual budgetary cycle, including the Finance Bill. </p></reply>

The online system is available 24 hours per day so that property owners can conduct their LPT affairs at a time that best suits their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am assured by Revenue that where any owner of multiple properties is experiencing difficulty using the online system assistance is available from the LPT Helpline at 1890 200 255, or by calling to their local tax office, or they can nominate a person to act on their behalf as provided for by Section 36 of the Act.</p></reply>

The Government approved this approach and legislation enabling the establishment of the SBCI was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014. </p>  <p>  The SBCI was incorporated in September 2014 and since then the SBCI has made considerable progress in building relations with lending partners and in constructing the complex operational capability required to bring products to market. These include establishing operational capability with funders and lending partners, building internal systems and business processes, and establishing a team to safely and effectively manage the funding provided on behalf of the State. In that regard, it is worth pointing out that both the CEO of KfW and the President of the European Investment Bank have complimented the Government's work on the establishment of the SBCI noting that the project from concept to establishment was achieved much more promptly than similar initiatives in other countries. </p>  <p>  The SBCI drew down &euro;200m of its funding from the European Investment Bank during December 2014 so that funds could be borrowed by its lending partners to be distributed to SMEs.  </p>  <p>  The SBCI is preparing for a nationwide launch of its products shortly with lending due to commence in Q1. The Government's aim for the SBCI is to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland. The SBCI will achieve this by working with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products and by supporting new entrants to the SME lending market.</p></reply>

A breakdown of these complaints on a county basis is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them were sent for analysis by the State Laboratory. Over 300 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory.<br/><br/>The scientific analysis required is complex and time consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples. Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location. The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.<br/><br/>Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicated the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol. If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br/><br/>Revenue will also continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to share information and intelligence with them on this issue. I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis. <br/><br/>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible action to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.</p></reply>

Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals. Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further advised me that non-bank lenders, including regulated and non-regulated firms, accounted for 5.2 per cent of the total stock of residential mortgage accounts outstanding at end-September 2014 (5.4 per cent in value terms). A total of 18,064 mortgage accounts issued by these lenders were in arrears of more than 90 days at end-September   this figure accounted for 15.5 per cent of total mortgages in arrears over 90 days. The outstanding balance on these accounts was &euro;3.8 billion, equivalent to 53 per cent of the total outstanding balance on all mortgage accounts issued by non-bank lenders. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers is not captured in Revenue systems for 2013 in a manner that can be analysed in respect of this Question. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete a self-assessment tax return.</p>  <p>  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2013 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of Income Tax and Corporation Tax. </p>  <p>  Corresponding data cannot yet be provided for 2014 as the tax returns for this year are not yet due.</p>  <p>  There are no property schemes or area based property incentives that could be considered active at the present time. All have expired and no new expenditure can qualify for any relief. However, there remains a potential Exchequer cost from these schemes as capital allowances and other reliefs, which had previously been given, continue to be claimed or carried forward to be claimed in future years. These are the basis for the costing given above.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of statutory provisions, introduced in recent years, which can potentially affect the rate at which these allowances can be used and, in some cases, terminate the carry-forward of allowances altogether. These are: </p>  <p>  -	The High Earners Restriction, which was introduced to ensure that, in the case of certain individuals, a minimum effective rate of income tax of 30% is paid annually. This is achieved by restricting the rate at which certain reliefs, including property incentives, can be used to shield income. While the reliefs themselves are not lost, their use is spread out potentially over a much longer time period.</p>  <p>  -	An upper limit on the annual use of excess capital allowances to shield other income of taxpayers. This provision applies primarily to passive investors in such projects.</p>  <p>  -	An additional charge to Universal Social Charge (USC) for certain higher income individuals on their use of these property reliefs.</p>  <p>  -	From 2015, it will not be possible for passive investors to carry-forward unused capital allowances beyond a building s tax life. Where the tax life has already ended, unused allowances have been lost since 1 January 2015.  </p>  <p>  These measures, in particular the one which came into effect on 1 January last, will address the legacy issues relating to the Exchequer cost of these expired property incentive schemes. I am further informed that currently there are 3 property related tax reliefs on the statute books which have not been formally commenced. These are:</p>  <p>  -	Relief for Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units (enacted in 2008), </p>  <p>  -	The Living City Initiative (enacted in 2013), and</p>  <p>  -	Relief for Certain Aviation Services Facilities (enacted in 2013).</p>  <p>  I have already stated my intention to commence the Living City Initiative and the relief for aviation services facilities as early as possible during this current year. Both of these reliefs are targeted and will only apply to expenditure incurred during a 5 year period from the date of commencement. However, there is no current Exchequer cost arising from these schemes.</p>  <p>For the purposes of this response it is assumed that tax reliefs related to principal private residences, including mortgage interest relief, do not come within the scope of the Deputy s request.  </p></reply>

These figures encompass both domestic and international financial and insurance services across the country as a whole.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners that it is not possible to precisely identify the contribution of companies located in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin to this total. There are however some indications of the size of this contribution.</p>  <p>  The estimated Corporation Tax paid in 2014 by companies previously licensed to operate in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) is of the order of &euro;545 million.  The estimated total PAYE and USC receipts associated with these companies for 2012, the latest year available, is in excess of &euro;250 million.  It should be noted that these figures relate only to those companies that were once licensed under the preferential IFSC tax regime, which expired in 2005, and for which registrations ceased in 2002.</p>  <p>  Following the end of the IFSC tax regime, the corporation tax rate applying to international financial services activities increased from 10% to the standard rate of 12.5%, and therefore it is generally speaking no longer possible to distinguish tax paid solely by companies operating in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin from tax paid by other companies in the sector.</p>  <p>  Separately, based on Revenue analysis of more recent Central Bank information on companies currently operating in the international financial services sector, it is estimated that these companies paid approximately &euro;600 million in Corporation Tax in 2012 (the most recent tax year for which data are available). The associated amount of PAYE and USC is tentatively estimated to be in the region of &euro;384 million. These estimates are tentative and should be considered as provisional, as they may be revised subject to improved information becoming available.  It should also be noted that the figures relate to the international financial services sector as a whole, and are not limited to companies operating in the geographical area of the IFSC, Dublin.</p></reply>

The structural deficit is calculated as the headline general government balance less the part of the deficit owing to the economic cycle.  This is known as the 'cyclical budgetary component' and relies on an estimate of the output gap.  From this, one-off temporary measures impacting the deficit are also deducted to arrive at an estimate of the structural budgetary position.  This is the budgetary position that would prevail in the absence of the impact of the economic cycle.  On this basis, consistent with the Budget 2015 outlook, the structural budget balance is projected to improve to -3.4% of GDP in 2015.  </p>  <p>  The projected 2015 structural balance will be reassessed in the context of the forthcoming Stability Programme Update next  April.</p></reply>

The financial incentive consists of:-</p>  <p> - &euro;23m in cash up-front</p>  <p> - &euro;4.25m for restructuring and integration costs</p>  <p> - &euro;2m for other transferring liabilities, and</p>  <p> - a maximum additional &euro;24.7m to cover additional costs resulting from all loans being written-off with nothing recovered. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the current position in respect of drawdowns to date and expected further expenditure from the Financial Incentives Agreement is as follows: </p>  <p> - Restructuring Costs payments to cover the establishment and maintenance of a recovery and underwriting platform for the Newbridge Credit Union loans.  This is capped at a possible &euro;3 million.  To date, &euro;1.3 million has been drawn down.  The Central Bank expects to incur a further c. &euro;0.2 million in such costs.</p>  <p> - Integration Costs payments to cover the costs of any redundancies of former Newbridge Credit Union staff.  This is capped at a possible &euro;1.25 million.  To date, nothing has been drawn down, but the Central Bank expects to incur the full &euro;1.25 million allocated to integration costs.</p>  <p> - Transferring Liabilities payments to cover liabilities that transferred to ptsb that were unknown at the point of transfer.  This is capped at a possible &euro;2 million.  To date, &euro;0.3 million has been drawn down.  The Central Bank does not expect further drawdowns under this heading.</p>  <p> - Loss Compensation Payments payments to ptsb to cover deterioration in the performance of the Newbridge Credit Union loan book.  The Central Bank has a 50/50 profit and loss sharing arrangement over a ten year period with ptsb in respect of these loans, so that the maximum cost the Central Bank can incur is &euro;24.7 million if all of the loans defaulted.  If the loans perform well, the Central Bank may have no liability under this heading, or could actually be paid by ptsb.  Given the performance on the loan book to date, the Central Bank expects to incur some costs under this heading, although nowhere close to the capped amount. </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 46(6) of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, the sale proceeds generated by the sale of the Newbridge Credit Union premises (net of expenses) will be paid by NCU into the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund in due course.  Under the Act, the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund is the principal creditor of NCU in the amount of the financial incentive paid or payable to ptsb.</p></reply>

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. </p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that currently about 56% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions.  Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns. </p>  <p>  There are two main types of lending restrictions:</p>  <p>  1. Monthly lending restrictions.  At this time less that 10% of all credit unions have this restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within one month.  Therefore, over 90% of credit unions (i.e. over 350 credit unions) have no monthly lending restrictions.</p>  <p>  2. Maximum loan size.  The average loan size in the credit union sector is just above &euro;6,000.  Currently 10 individual credit unions have lending restrictions that limit the amount per loan to less than &euro;10,000.  Although there are individual credit unions with lending restrictions above &euro;10,000 per loan, that the vast majority  of credit unions (over 95%)  can continue to make individual loans significantly greater than the average loan size for the sector. </p>  <p>  These restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels.  Reviews of individual lending restrictions are included within the planned 2015 supervisory work programme of the Registry of Credit Unions.  Where a credit union can evidence improvements in its credit management practices, and systems and controls which support prudent lending, the Registrar is open to removal of restrictions.  I have introduced legislative change whereby, as of 1 August 2013, regulatory directions are appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</p>  <p>  I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy.  However, the issue of lending needs to be constructively considered in order to ensure a viable credit union sector into the future.</p></reply>

The referenda in those years were not taken on their own but were combined and accounted for with European and Local Elections in 2004 and with a Presidential and bye-election in 2011.

The reform of the public service procurement functions will deliver sustainable savings for the tax payer.  <br/><br/>The OGP is increasingly taking responsibility for the procurement of Professional Services. Professional Services encompasses four primary categories namely<br/><br/>- Legal &amp;amp; Insurance<br/><br/>- Consulting &amp;amp; Advisory<br/><br/>- Banking &amp;amp; Finance<br/><br/>- Construction &amp;amp; Engineering<br/><br/>In terms of reducing costs associated with management consultants fees, accountant fees and legal advice fees, the OGP intends putting in place National Frameworks for the following during 2015:<br/><br/>1. Financial &amp;amp; Economic Consultancy Services (Accountancy, Audit, Tax, Economic Appraisal etc)<br/><br/>2. Solicitors Legal Services (Local Government)<br/><br/>3. Solicitors Legal Services (ETB's)<br/><br/>4. Advisory &amp;amp; Consulting Services Tranche 1 (Business Strategy, Operations Management, Policy, Research &amp;amp; Development)<br/><br/>5. Solicitors Legal Services for Whole of Government<br/><br/>6. Advisory &amp;amp; Consulting Services Tranche 2 (Human Resources, Project &amp;amp; Change Management, Risk)<br/><br/>Where appropriate, these frameworks will be underpinned by the following; <br/><br/>- Improved operational efficiencies and reduced costs; <br/><br/>- Discipline, continuity and consistency to the provision of professional services;<br/><br/>- Establishment of a supply base with broad service coverage and improved service quality;<br/><br/>A framework structure which has the potential to impact positively on the Irish economy and society.<br/><br/>These frameworks will provide an opportunity for public service bodies to leverage the full buying power of the State in delivering value for money, reduce risk through standardised terms and conditions, and reduce their own administration costs.  My Department has issued guidance to public bodies through Circular 16/13 reminding them of the value for money to achieved for the taxpayer through centralised contracts and frameworks and that their use is government policy. </p></reply>

The TEC database aims to fill the information gap on actors involved in cross-border trade, and contains international annual trade data broken down by different categories of enterprises. However, comprehensive statistics answering all aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s query are not readily available, particularly with regard to ownership categorisation within the available pan-European datasets.  The most recent year of analysis presented by the OECD is 2011, and outlines comparative data for exporting enterprises across a range of OECD member countries including European Union members. <br/><br/>As can be seen from Table 1 which follows, Ireland has a comparable number of exporting companies in the employment size category of 0-249 employees (equivalent to SME employment criteria.  One note of caution in interpreting the above data is that the categorisation relates to employee size class only, and does not represent Small and Medium Sized Enterprises as defined at European level (which includes further criteria related to turnover and balance sheet information)), to European countries such as Denmark, Hungary and Sweden, and significantly exceeds countries including Italy, Germany, Finland, the UK and France. <br/><br/>In terms of value per enterprise (0-249 employees), Ireland ranks among the highest in the OECD area (in fact only exceeded by New Zealand).  The figures also show that Ireland has higher than average numbers of large (250 + employee) firms that export as a percentage of the total enterprise base.  This is a well-established characteristic of the Irish enterprise base, related to the high degree of foreign direct investment attracted to the country, and the high proportion of total exports accounted for by highly globalised multinationals operating within Ireland&rsquo;s small open economy.<br/><br/>In relation to plans to increase the number of exporting firms in the economy, I as Minister have made the internationalisation of SMEs a major priority within the annual Action Plan for Jobs. <br/><br/>This effort is being driven by my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for driving the growth of exports from Irish SMEs on world markets.  The agency reported record international sales from its client base in 2013, with exports exceeding &euro;17.1bn. <br/><br/>Scaling companies through exports is a key pillar of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2014-2016 Strategy.  Following a weaker global environment than expected in 2014, global growth is expected to strengthen moderately (3.8%) in 2015 (Source: IMF).  Enterprise Ireland clients&rsquo; two biggest markets, the UK and US, are expected to continue to grow strongly.  However, increasing downside risks, including the ongoing weakness in the Euro area, could impact on global growth.<br/><br/>Increasing exports means more jobs, and in 2014, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus was on helping clients build their positions in markets where they are strong and adding to the infrastructure and supports to maximise opportunities for Irish companies in key High Growth Markets (HGMs).<br/><br/>Special efforts were targeted at developing client exports in High Growth Markets and, in 2014 Enterprise Ireland received sanction for 20 additional staff in these markets to help grow exports to &euro;3bn by 2016.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland assisted clients secured more than 1,300 new customers and significant contracts (40% of new customers in HGMs), and its clients established 455 new presences in international markets (45% in HGMs).<br/><br/>In addition, Enterprise Ireland worked with early stage HPSU companies to help them secure 131 new international reference customers. Final export figures for 2014 are expected to be announced by Enterprise Ireland in Quarter 2 of this year. <br/><br/>Among the initiatives planned to further the internationalisation of SMEs in Ireland for 2015 are:<br/><br/>- Enterprise Ireland through its programmes and overseas office network will target support for clients to achieve &euro;19 billion in exports in 2015.<br/><br/>- A programme of 18 overseas ministerial-led trade missions and events will take place in 2015.<br/><br/>- EI will implement a targeted programme to attract senior level key inward buyer visits from key companies to match Irish supply capability in key sectors.<br/><br/>- Continued focus on the Potential Exporters in the enterprise base, by hosting nine Potential Exporter Awareness Events, and nine Potential Exporter Workshops across the country.  This will target over 700 companies to have significant engagement with the EI Potential Exporter Division during 2015.<br/><br/>I am confident that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus on ensuring the right supports are available for clients at every stage of growth, coupled with its priority to develop strong, export-focused, ambitious Irish companies that can win new business abroad, will ensure that exports from indigenous SMEs will continue to grow.<br/><br/><b><i>Table 1: TEC Database &ndash; OECD &ndash; Comparison of OECD exporting entities 2011</i></b><table><tr><th>Country</th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) per 10,000 Population </th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) as % Total Exporting Enterprises (number)</th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) as % Total Exporting Enterprises (value)</th></tr><tr><td>Estonia</td><td><div>89.11</div></td><td><div>99.1%</div></td><td><div>75.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td><div>82.49</div></td><td><div>98.8%</div></td><td><div>59.5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td><div>72.71</div></td><td><div>99.1%</div></td><td><div>69.5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Slovak Republic</td><td><div>54.30</div></td><td><div>98.6%</div></td><td><div>38.3%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td><div>48.66</div></td><td><div>97.8%</div></td><td><div>49.9%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td><div>45.91</div></td><td><div>97.5%</div></td><td><div>48.8%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Hungary</td><td><div>41.59</div></td><td><div>98.5%</div></td><td><div>46.5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td><div>41.10</div></td><td><div>97.8%</div></td><td><div>37.7%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td><div>40.16</div></td><td><div>93.7%</div></td><td><div>76.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td><div>39.48</div></td><td><div>98.8%</div></td><td><div>57.3%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td><div>33.88</div></td><td><div>99.1%</div></td><td><div>56.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td><div>32.86</div></td><td><div>98.6%</div></td><td><div>48.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td><div>30.31</div></td><td><div>98.4%</div></td><td><div>51.9%</div></td></tr><tr><td>New Zealand</td><td><div>28.06</div></td><td><div>100.0%</div></td><td><div>100.0%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td><div>24.22</div></td><td><div>96.6%</div></td><td><div>32.2%</div></td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td><div>21.15</div></td><td><div>97.6%</div></td><td><div>44.1%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Poland</td><td><div>17.86</div></td><td><div>97.1%</div></td><td><div>41.5%</div></td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td><div>14.82</div></td><td><div>96.5%</div></td><td><div>42.9%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td><div>11.38</div></td><td><div>96.3%</div></td><td><div>38.7%</div></td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td><div>9.04</div></td><td><div>96.2%</div></td><td><div>29.6%</div></td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td><div>6.86</div></td><td><div>97.1%</div></td><td><div>59.8%</div></td></tr></table><br/><br/>Source: Data extracted on 09 Feb 2015 from OECD Stat<br/><br/>Source: OECD TEC by sector and size class; OECD Total population</p></reply>

Regional aid is also provided under schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.  All such aid comes from the Exchequer rather than from EU or other external funding.  The LEOs in the Counties covered by the Regional Aid Programme are fully apprised of the Guidelines.

Earlier this week, I announced the appointment of the University of Limerick (UL) to carry out the study. The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process.  The key objectives of the study are:<br/><br/>- To fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<br/><br/>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.<br/><br/>- To enable the Minister to make any <i>evidence-based</i>policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<br/><br/>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, including the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors in particular. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular.<br/><br/>Unlike the position in the UK, Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides that where employees on zero hour contracts suffer a loss by not being given the hours they were requested to work or be available for work, they can be compensated for 25% of the time or 15 hours, whichever is less. There is no equivalent provision in the UK, where employees on zero hours contracts are only paid for time spent working and if they are not given any hours by their employer they receive no compensation.<br/><br/>It is expected that a wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to the study, including employers, trade unions, relevant Government Departments and relevant state bodies. I expect the study to be completed within six months of commencement.</p></reply>

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<br/><br/>Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs </i>for 2013 and 2014.  Developing manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multinationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.</i><br/><br/>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors, including both Manufacturing and Services, are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 </i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start-up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment.<br/><br/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available). The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy, which are outside the remit of the Development Agencies, have also shown significant growth in employment in recent years.<br/><br/>It would not be appropriate to set individual targets on a county basis, so specific data for Kildare, as requested by the Deputy is not available. However, right across the country, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies especially with manufacturing and services companies, with consequent job creation and retention.<br/><br/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies. In relation to developing the SME sector, in addition to the work of Enterprise Ireland, the new Local Enterprise Offices ( LEOs) are working to develop the smaller businesses and helping them to grow and prosper.<br/><br/>To ensure a better spread of industrial development in the regions, I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the Mid-East region, which includes Country Kildare, has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 13.8% to 10.7% in the last 2 years alone. The overall National Unemployment rate continues to fall and now stands at 10.5%, a dramatic improvement on the position which pertained just a few years ago, after this Government took office.</p></reply>

The 2015 Action Plan, which I recently launched, contains a suite of 380 actions to ensure we deliver not just the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, but an additional 40,000 jobs this year alone. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland uses a developmental approach across all aspects of clients&rsquo; needs, including business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, leadership and management development, and access to finance. EI supports are tailored to reflect companies&rsquo; stage of development. This ensures that all of its clients, from Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups, to exporting SMEs and scaling companies, can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and sustain jobs.<br/><br/>In January, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014. These companies continue to see year-on-year jobs growth in 2014 and they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the agency. This employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.<br/><br/>The outlook for new job creation in 2015 is positive and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus will remain on ensuring that its clients have access to all of the necessary supports required to build on this momentum.  This focus, coupled with EI&rsquo;s priority to support entrepreneurship across the regions, and develop strong, export focussed, ambitious Irish companies that can win new business, will mean more jobs for Ireland over the next 12 months. Details on EI&rsquo;s offering to business are available at .<br/><br/>At a micro level, each of the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), established last year, is preparing a Local Enterprise Development Plan for 2015 which will set out strategic objectives around which they will deliver their range of supports, advice and information to the small and micro business community. The Plans include targets for the key metrics of business start-ups, business expansions and jobs created / sustained, as well as initiatives to drive entrepreneurship and greater levels of economic activity. Details on the LEOs and their offering to business are available at .<br/><br/>In terms of access to finance for SMEs, my Department introduced two credit schemes, the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, both of which have been in operation since October 2012. Both Schemes are novel in an Irish context and are continuing to develop a position in the Irish financial arena. Both represent a significant change in our enterprise supports, which primarily have been focused on the exporting sectors, since these supports are also available to the locally traded sectors, in view of their crucial role in job creation. Businesses can access details of these and other SME support schemes at .<br/><br/>My Department is actively reviewing and improving both Schemes and will take the necessary legislative steps to deliver changes to both Schemes, including a new CGS to allow for re-financing, a Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill and a revised Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme.</p></reply>

The Partnership Agreement was adopted in November 2014.  Specifically, in the context of support for innovation and technology, the following has been agreed between the European Commission and the Irish Government:</p>  <p>- &euro;320 million for the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020, with &euro;160 million coming from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The Programme will be managed by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.</p>  <p>- &euro;498 million for the Southern and Eastern (S&amp;E) Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020, with some &euro;249 million coming from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The Programme will be managed by the Southern Assembly.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the total programme expenditure for the two ERDF Programmes, including EU and matching funding, amounts to just over &euro;800 million.</p>  <p>  The investments will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, spearheading entrepreneurship initiatives to boost the growth potential and competitiveness of Ireland's small business. The Programmes are expected to support more than 60,000 SMEs across the country with direct financial assistance or other support measures such as mentoring, management training and advisory services, creating over 9,000 jobs in directly-supported enterprises. A further 340 high-growth companies will benefit directly from R&amp;D and Innovation supports.</p>  <p>  The Programmes also aim to complement wider investment programmes in targeted high-growth and innovative sectors to support the creation of new quality jobs and boost innovation, as well as helping to grow the local economies, in these regions.</p>  <p>  In addition to grant assistance available to Ireland under the above Programmes, Irish researchers and businesses can also compete for funding under the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation.  The current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, which is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, is Horizon 2020. The Programme has a budget of close to &euro;80bn. and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies who compete successfully for funding from this large research funding resource will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts.</p>  <p>  There are three main pillars in Horizon 2020 &ndash; Excellent Science, Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges.  There are specific opportunities for SMEs across the Horizon 2020 Programme, including an SME Instrument which can provide support for consortia of highly innovative smaller companies collaborating on projects.</p>  <p>  The H2020 national support system is based in Enterprise Ireland consisting of a national office and a network of national contact points in the relevant programme areas.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-12a.292.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021200061#WRK01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 113 together.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Policy Statement on Foreign Direct Investment, which was published at the end of July 2014, sets out the strategic direction for FDI to 2020 and the key actions needed to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness and business environment in the context of intensified international competition for investment and talent.  As the Deputy is aware Ireland continues to perform well in the attraction of new investment and particularly so in recent years as FDI inflows to Europe have slowed considerably.</p>  <p>  Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland. The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and changing corporate taxation landscape.  There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new-name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014.</p>  <p>  This highlights both the draw of large wealthy markets for FDI, particularly when the focus activities are sales and marketing, but also investor options across Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe and Western Europe for manufacturing, R&amp;D and business support services. The range of countries competing for FDI in Europe demonstrates the intensity of the marketplace to secure investments for Ireland. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, cost competitiveness, the availability of a dynamic talent pool and targeted sectoral focus, was underpinned by the strong economic management and certainty on the 12.5% corporate tax rate.</p>  <p>  The US continues to be the largest single investor in Europe accounting for about 25% of all inward investment projects and job creation.  While Ireland is a very significant recipient of US FDI for contestable investments, competition with the UK, Germany and France, the major overall beneficiaries of US investment into Europe, is intense. The proposed TTIP currently under negotiation could be transformational in this area.  There are potentially many benefits for Ireland from a successful deal but we must also be aware that such trade deals can impact FDI flows.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland constantly monitors competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment.  Competitor locations differ depending on the sector of the mobile investment.  In this respect, IDA Ireland is continuously working to ensure that Ireland is the most competitive, innovative and relevant to the investment being targeted.</p>  <p>  Multinational companies account for almost 10% of the Irish workforce and are of crucial strategic importance for the economy due to the quality of the jobs involved, their export focus and the massive knock-on impact they have on the wider economy.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s relative cost competitiveness, corporate tax regime and available direct firm level financial supports remain critically important - but in reality they are no longer aspects that will substantially differentiate Ireland&rsquo;s offering for FDI over the longer term.  So in addition to maintaining a competitive offering in these areas we must at the same time redouble efforts to develop and reinforce the aspects that truly differentiate Ireland&rsquo;s offering in a context of intensified global competition for mobile investment. With this objective in view, IDA Ireland is in the process of preparing a new corporate strategy for the years 2015 to 2020, which is currently being finalised and will be launched in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Yesterday, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.</p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.</p></reply>

As well as those recruited directly into such vacancies, there is a clear focus on improvements in education and training through the provision of programmes for a diverse range of unemployed people. These include those provided by the Education and Training Boards in the implementation of the Further Education Strategy 2014-2018, the Momentum programmes, the Higher Education authority&rsquo;s Springboard programmes which offer short higher education courses for jobseekers with previous work experience, employment incentive schemes such as JobsPlus and the doubling of places on high-level ICT third level courses as part of the second ICT Skills Action Plan. The 16th January call for employers and education providers to collaborate in developing a range of new apprenticeships should provide further opportunities for those on the live register seeking to develop careers across a broader range of apprenticeships across the manufacturing and services sectors. The Action Plan for Jobs since 2012 has set a comprehensive set of measures agreed by Government to promote job opportunities and employment growth in all parts of the country. The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  It commits to implementing the 70 actions in Pathways to Work 2015. These include beginning the new account management approach to employers, roll-out JobPath, continuing to roll-out the Youth Guarantee initiatives, and introduce a Back to Work Family Dividend. Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.</p>  <p>  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels. Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.6 per cent at end 2014. In 2014, client companies of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland created 8,476 and 7,131 net new jobs respectively; this represents the highest levels of net new job creation by agency client companies in over a decade and most of this employment growth was in full-time employment.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan contains a suite of 380 actions to deliver an additional 40,000 jobs this year. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) plays a key role in advising on the current and future skills required by employer and that education and training provision reflects these needs, through for example providing the guidelines on skills needs for the annual Springboard courses for jobseekers. Officials from the Department of Education and Skills and my Department, the HEA and further and higher education and training providers participate in the EGFSN along with industry representatives and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles including in ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics &ndash; including warehousing and growth in the hospitality sector.</p></reply>

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. The CSO data for January 2015 indicates that the number of persons aged 25 on the Live Register and under has fallen to 13.7% from 15.1% in January 2014, a reduction of 11,248 over the year.  The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.5 per cent in January 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.   Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) plays a key role in advising on future enterprise skills needs and that education and training provision is providing our young people with the skills required to take up available employment opportunities. Officials from the Department of Education and Skills and my Department, the HEA and further and higher education and training providers participate in the EGFSN along with industry representatives and the enterprise development agencies. Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles including in ICT, data analytics, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics &ndash; including warehousing and growth in the hospitality sector.</p>  <p>  While it is the Pathways to Work strategy that focuses on specific measures to improve employment opportunities for young persons, the steps taken to date under previous Action Plans, and those set out for this year, complement that work and directly assist young job seekers. The Action Plan for Jobs commits to implementing the 70 actions in Pathways to Work 2015. These include beginning the new account management approach to employers, roll-out JobPath, continuing to roll-out the Youth Guarantee initiatives, and introduce a Back to Work Family Dividend. In addition, as part of Pathways to Work, a new JobsPlus strand for young people will be available in 2015 under the Youth Guarantee.</p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January 2014.  The Youth Developmental Internship, First Steps, is an additional measure to provide youth with valuable work. This will offer young jobseekers aged between 18 and 25 the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and training with the help of dedicated assistance from department of Social Protection case officers. The target is to provide up to 1,500 work experience placements of six to nine months duration for young job seekers during 2015. Earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed will also be introduced. Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015.</p>  <p>  There will be a continuing focus on improvement in skills provision through the provision of programmes for a diverse range of individuals including young unemployed people through the Education and Training Boards in the implementation of the Further Education Strategy 2014-2018, the Momentum programmes, the recent launch of the fifth iteration of Springboard, offering short higher education courses for jobseekers with previous work experience, employment incentive schemes such as JobsPlus and doubling of high-end skills as part of the second ICT Skills Action Plan. The launch of the call for new apprenticeships should provide further opportunities for young people to find rewarding careers for the future.</p>  <p>  In the areas of entrepreneurship, the launch of the Local Enterprise Offices provides a first-stop-shop for young entrepreneurs with an idea or interested in starting a business and we will build on the success of &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition which was launched in 2014.</p></reply>

Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years and we have climbed to 15<sup>th</sup>in the IMD competitiveness rankings. Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness. <br/><br/>The real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) is a measure of the trade-weighted exchange rate for Ireland, adjusted for relative price developments. In December 2014, Ireland's real HCI fell by 4.4 per cent year on year. A fall indicates an improvement in price competitiveness and leaves Irish-based firms better equipped to compete on the international market. Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers. A weaker euro has improved our cost competitiveness in non-euro area markets.<br/><br/>There has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness. The European Commission in its winter forecasts estimate that real unit labour costs in Ireland will fall by 2.0 per cent annually in 2015 compared with an increase of 0.3 per cent in the UK, and a fall 0.9 per cent in the euro over the same time period. Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>trading partners as well as productivity improvements. <br/><br/>We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis. This is specifically required under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. Action 247 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services. The NCC note that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last four or five years. This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. However, despite these improvements, the NCC note that it is essential that we continue to focus on reducing costs that comprise a significant percentage of business costs and that are out of line with those in competitor countries. <br/><br/>Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness, therefore, remains a key economic priority for Government.</p></reply>

To support the delivery of property solutions for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises nationally, Enterprise Ireland, working with other enterprise partners such as the Local Authorities and other local community organisations, co-funds the establishment of Community Enterprise Centres across Ireland. Since the launch of the first of four Community Enterprise Centres (CEC) schemes in 1989, &euro;46 million has been drawn on for the development of CECs across the country. There are 3 Community Enterprise Centres in Kildare (Athy Community Enterprise Centre; Allenwood Enterprise Park Naas; and Thompson Business Centre Clane).  Enterprise Ireland does not have the management of a portfolio of industrial buildings available for leasing and letting within its remit. From an industrial development perspective, IDA Ireland is the lead agency nationally with responsibility for property solutions. IDA Ireland has a dedicated property unit which is best placed to offer insight into the type, mix and grade of commercial accommodation needed nationally, and is cognisant of the needs of Irish exporting companies in addition to foreign investors, in this regard.<br/><br/>Earlier today the Government announced details of its 5-year, &euro;250 million Regional Strategy, aimed at accelerating the jobs recovery in every part of the country. Action Plan for Jobs - Regional - is based on the principle that the best way to support job-creation in towns and villages across the country is to support agencies and organisations within 8 regions, to build on the particular strengths and assets of their area and drive new job-creation strategies and projects. <br/><br/>The Strategy is based on the successful Action Plan for Jobs model of setting out lists of actions with timelines and responsibility allocated, and then monitoring implementation. <br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will lead the initiative. Each of the 8 regions will develop its own Action Plan. It is my intention that all Regional Plans will be published or in development by July 2015. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">Under the Strategy, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation. The objective is to bring forward fresh collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise and job creation in the region. An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports. It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">The criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Promoting a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Developing capacity to start up and scale companies; filling gaps in enterprise facilities; </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage; </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Devising a credible plan to deliver added value in jobs and start-ups and increased level of exporting / potential exporters;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Commitment of matching finance; </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Bringing originality in approach, objectives, leverage of other stakeholders;</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Leveraging off other enterprise support (Mentoring, funding, networks);</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">-Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment/collaboration with others players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, Chambers etc.) </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">I believe this is a significant challenge and a significant opportunity for the Community Enterprise Centres, in collaboration with others, to deliver new businesses and jobs in their locality.</font></p></reply>

In order to achieve these benefits, it is clear that the management of our commonages must be carried out in a cohesive and integrated manner.  The best mechanism to do so is a common plan, drawn up by one Advisor who takes the individual circumstances of each shareholder into consideration and assigns stocking levels appropriate to the individual farmer, within the context of the overall needs of the commonage.  I have met with various hill-farmer representatives on all of these issues, I have listened very carefully to their concerns and I am now very confident that we can deliver a successful implementation strategy for these commonages.  I have taken account of the issues raised and have now provided that a farmer may apply individually to join GLAS on the commonage or commonages on which they farm.  I also know that the question of being excluded from the Scheme because the 50% participation rate is not reached needs to be addressed .  Therefore I have made it clear that in these situations inability to reach that target will not prove a barrier to entry to the Scheme.</p>  <p>  My focus now is to secure Commission approval of the Rural Development Programme at the earliest possible date so that I can open GLAS to applications.   </p></reply>

The Greening Payment is an important part of the CAP following the Reform that was agreed during the Irish Presidency in June 2013.  The Greening Payment will amount to approximately 30% of the overall payment made to farmers under the new Regime.  The three main elements of the greening requirements are as follows:<blockquote>- Crop Diversification;<br /><br />- Ecological Focus Areas;<br /><br />- Protection of Permanent Grassland including sensitive grassland.</blockquote>As the protection of permanent grassland will be applied at national level, the main two measures that will impact on farmers are Crop Diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFA).  The farmers involved are arable growers, who will declare 10 hectares or more of arable land in 2015.  Bearing in mind the complex nature of the requirements, my Department has built an on-line application facility, which will assist farmers in applying for payments under the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening Payment.  Under the EFA requirements, I decided that the following landscape features and areas could be utilised by farmers in Ireland:<table><tr><th>Hedgerows </th><th>Nitrogen Fixing Crops (Protein crops) </th></tr><tr><td>Drains </td><td>Catch Crops </td></tr><tr><td>Buffer Strips </td><td>Short Rotation Coppice </td></tr><tr><td>Field copses </td><td>Land lying fallow </td></tr><tr><td>BPS Eligible Forestry </td><td></td></tr></table><br/><br/>The three landscape features are hedgerows, drains and buffer strips.  The others are area-related measures and can be declared as such by applicants, who select one or more of these options in their 2015 Basic Payment Scheme/Greening Payment application.  My Department, using datasets from Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) and other software applications, established a database of hedgerows, drains and buffer strips for use by applicants in the on-line application.  As these features were identified by electronic means, they will, of course need to be checked and verified by applicants and their advisors / consultants.  When the data is verified, the on-line facility will provide applicants with the EFA contribution of each feature in all land parcels declared.  The on-line application will also inform farmers whether they are compliant or not with the greening requirements based on the area details declared by them.  In addition to the updating of the data by applicants and their agents, the database will be updated by the findings of eligibility inspection undertaken in 2015 and subsequent years.<br/><br/>With a view to assisting arable farmers and providing as much information as is possible to them before they submit their 2015 application, my Department will issue a complete set of maps outlining the landscape features in each parcel together with a comprehensive Guidance Manual to all arable farmers next week.<br/><br/>My Department has worked closely, and continues to do so, with the farming organisations, Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants Association together with individual arable farmers in developing the application process in Ireland.</p></reply>

This principle remains the foundation of the new Basic Payment Scheme that will be introduced in 2015.  The number of animals held by a farmer, or any other aspects of their agricultural production, has no impact on the value of direct payment they will receive.  The most significant feature of the Basic Payment Scheme is the process of &lsquo;convergence&rsquo; whereby farmers with low value entitlements will see the value of their entitlements increase while those with high value entitlements will see their value decrease over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements will have a minimum value of 60% of the national average entitlement value.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the relevant EU Regulations, priority under the National Reserve will be given to farmers meeting the definition of Young Farmer and New Entrant in the first instance.

Hedgerows are estimated to cover 3.9% of the Irish landscape.  The REPS and AEOS schemes facilitated the planting of approximately 10,000 km of new hedgerows and the rejuvenation of some 3,000 more.  The total area of hedgerow and non forest woodland patches across the landscape could possibly represent a significant carbon sink and could potentially be used as a mitigation option. <br/><br/>Where tree cover extends to 0.1 ha or more and meets height and ground cover criteria, areas are classified as forest and come within the national carbon reporting system under the 2013 EU LULUCF Decision <b>(</b>Decision No 529/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information concerning actions relating to those activities) and under the Kyoto Protocol.<br/><br/>At the moment there is no national inventory system to facilitate the accounting of hedgerow sinks under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is a lack of historic baseline data to be used as a reference period for calculating greenhouse gas changes over time.  However the Environmental protection Agency (EPA) and Teagasc have concluded a climate change research programme<i></i>on carbon sequestration by hedgerows in the Irish landscape, using a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing technology and terrestrial laser scanning for assessing hedgerow biomass. This technology can measure the physical characteristics of hedges and the work has concluded that a national inventory of hedgerows is technically feasible.<br/><br/>The content of this report and its recommendations will be considered by my Department in the context of the 2013 LULUCF decision.

While the medium term outlook was positive, it was important that the EU Commission use the measures available to it to assist the situation in the short term. We acknowledged that the Commission had already taken the step of extending private storage aid for butter and skimmed milk powder to the end of September 2015 and proposed that such aid should be re-introduced for cheese. We also proposed serious consideration of intervention, to be undertaken at price levels that would positively support the market.</p>  <p>  From previous contacts with the Commission, we had received assurances that it would be possible to phase the burden of super levy payments for producers over a period of time and we sought assurances that this could be extended to the level of Member State. The Commissioner has promised to respond at next month&rsquo;s Council to this proposal.</p>  <p>  As regards other products affected by the Russian embargo, we called on the Commission to introduce a scheme of aids to private storage for the pig-meat sector, referencing the rapid and substantial drop in prices and the real effects being felt by producers from the loss of the Russian market. </p></reply>

At present, in order that an organisation would be entitled to register with the GCVU, they must outline their level of substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</p>  <p>  Given the large number and wide range of client groups, the registration process is managed through umbrella organisations which provide single points of contact.  This ensures more effective coordination and improved quality control in the various sectors and a more efficient use of resources in the vetting process. It is not possible or feasible to extend the registration process to individuals as this would result in the vetting process being overwhelmed and consequent unacceptable delays in processing times.</p>  <p>  Due to a need to review the disclosure provisions in the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, the Act has yet to be commenced. However, once commenced the Act will provide that any organisation/individual who is able to establish that they are conducting relevant work, as defined in the Act, will be able to register with the Garda Central Vetting Unit for vetting services either in their own capacity or through an umbrella organisation as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the current position as outlined above, it is recommended that the category of persons referred to in the Deputy's question consults within their own profession with a view to identifying the appropriate umbrella organisation to handle their application.</p></reply>

The position remains as stated.<br/><br/><b>Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 123 of Thursday, 4th December 2014.</b><br/><br/>All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In particular, these conditions require that an applicant is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; that he or she intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and has made a declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State in the prescribed manner. A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.<br/><br/>It would be inappropriate for me to indicate how specific offences will be considered in any future application as each application is considered on its merits based on the entirety of the case presented at that time. I can inform the Deputy that I am concerned to ensure that the threshold of what constitutes good character is, taking all things into account, maintained at an appropriate level and as such is fair to all applicants having regard to their particular<b></b>circumstances.<br/><br/>It is open to the person concerned to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.<br/><br/>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<br/><br/>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

To support parents who are accessing childcare services through these services, my Department allocates funding in the region of &euro;260 million annually to provide for the implementation of a number of childcare support programmes.  The support programmes enable more than 100,000 to avail of quality childcare and education services each year.<br/><br/>There is currently a focus on improving the quality of early childhood care and education services and a number of reforms are being introduced by my Department under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  These reforms include a requirement for all staff working directly with children to hold minimum childcare qualifications.  Funding totalling &euro;3 million is made available in 2014/2015 to support childcare staff who are seeking to meet the new qualification requirements.<br/><br/>I am aware of the concerns of childcare professionals in relation to levels of remuneration in the childcare sector.  I acknowledge the commitment of childcare staff to the provision of childcare services and I have indicated that when resources become available I would welcome further investment in the sector.  I have met and will be meeting again the representatives of childcare providers to discuss a range of issues relating to childcare provision and I will give careful consideration to their views on future investment in the sector.<br/><br/>To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.<b></b>This new group will include representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. </p>  <p>  As with all programmes involving significant expenditure, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.</p>  <p>  The Tuam School Completion project comprises three primary schools and two post-primary schools in the areas mentioned by the Deputy. I am advised that an amount of  &euro;131,976 was allocated by the Agency to the project for the school year 2014-2015.  The amount provided for 2014-2015 takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014. The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the School Completion Programme project for the area is a matter for the Local Management Committee.</p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation. My Department has recently issued a Performance Statement to the Agency under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan. The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.</p>  <p>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency. The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  Preliminary information gathered on the programme indicates that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad and diverse range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects over the years.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014-2015 academic year.</p></reply>

The teams are providing analysis, assessments and recommendations on any improvements that are required.  This work is ongoing and leading to actions that are embedded in terms of good practice and value for money.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of Haddington Road and the Joint Oversight Group, there is also a task group in place for the purposes of examining the costs of services that are being provided, particularly linked to staffing levels and skill mix in public services. The task group has representatives from the HSE, the INMO, SIPTU and INAD. This ongoing piece of work is set to conclude in the coming weeks and make recommendations to the Joint Oversight Group with regards to these particular issues. It is hoped that agreement can be reached, and this can be implemented in the course of 2015.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in this context the HSE intends to publish its revised costs of care later in the year as the work comes to finality and the staffing and skill mix requirements are being implemented. </p></reply>

This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes. However, there is adequate flexibility available within the terms of existing legislative provisions, and through ongoing discussions between the HSE and HIQA, for solutions to be found. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure. It is therefore very important that the services provided by public facilities be maintained.  In this context the HSE has been working with HIQA over the past number of months to meet the re-registration requirements of these units, and my Department is closely monitoring the situation. </p></reply>

The salary scales for new entrant consultants' were reduced by 10% with effect from 1st January 2011. A further reduction of 30% was applied to these scales for those interviewed for posts on or after 1st October 2012. In addition, on 1st July 2013 consultants' pay was reduced in line with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013. As set out in the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), these reductions were not applied to the 1 October 2012 pay scales, having regard to the level of reduction already applied. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HRA specifically recognised the need to support recruitment and retention of consultants and other doctors.  In light of the specific provisions therein, the MacCraith Group was established at that time and recommended last April that "the relevant parties commence, as a matter of urgency, a focused, timetabled IR engagement of short duration to address the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration between new entrant Consultants and their established peers that have emerged since 2012. </p>  <p>  The agreement reached between the HSE and the IMO at the LRC on the 7th January 2015 following engagement that also involved my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is aimed at addressing the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration that have emerged since 2012 between new entrant consultants and their established peers. Sanction has now issued to the HSE to proceed with the implementation of the LRC pay proposal.</p>  <p>  An essential component of the approach to addressing the State&rsquo;s fiscal difficulties has been the firm focus on improving public service efficiency and effectiveness. Consultants have been subject to changes in work practices under the Public Service Agreement and the HRA. These include the range of flexibilities agreed at the LRC in September 2012 to enhance productivity and efficiency and the additional hours under the HRA. I have no plans to reduce consultant pay any further.  </p></reply>

I again requested that the Board of NMBI re-engage in discussions with the staff associations, as a matter of urgency. I expressed my concern regarding the implications for the health service and patient safety should the current impasse over the annual retention fee increase continue. I appreciate the registration fee is set by the NMBI which is a self-funding organisation. </p>  <p>  The President of the NMBI has stated that NMBI is facing considerable costs arising from changes to the way the laws regulating the professions operate, and also from handling fitness to practice complaints. In addition to supporting the new public fitness to practise structures, he further stated the fee increase will foster excellence in the professions through a more effective Continuing Professional Development (CPD) framework, an enhanced scope of practice and the new Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for registered nurses and midwives recently published. </p>  <p>  I encouraged the NMBI to find an outcome to the current situation which secures the Board&rsquo;s minimum financial operating requirements but avoids a scenario where nurses and midwives are removed from the Register for non-payment of fees with potential consequences for service availability. Since that meeting the Board has agreed to engage in discussions with the nursing unions with a view to holding further talks, facilitated by a third party, on the means by which the board and staff associations might come to an agreement on the fee structure for the future. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Board&rsquo;s accounts are examined by the Comptroller and Auditors General&rsquo;s Office. In this regard the accounts for 2012 and 2013 were recently published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available on the website of NMBI. </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation closely in the interests of patient safety and continuity of care.</p></reply>

The Department of Finance has confirmed the figures for 2013 and 2014 as follows:<table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>RISK EQUALISATION SCHEME</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;413m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;413m</td></tr></table>The Community Rating Levy for the years in question are shown in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Rate (Under 18) </th><th>Rate (over 18)</th></tr><tr><td>2014 <br /><br />(from 1 March 2014 to 28 February 2015)</td><td>&euro;100 (non-advanced cover)<br /><br />&euro;135 (advanced cover)</td><td>&euro;290 (non-advanced cover)<br /><br />&euro;399 (advanced cover)</td></tr><tr><td>2013 <br /><br />(from 31 March 2013 to 28 February 2014)</td><td>&euro;100 (non-advanced cover)<br /><br />&euro;120 (advanced cover)</td><td>&euro;290 (non-advanced cover)<br /><br />&euro;350 (advanced cover)</td></tr><tr><td>2012/Q1 2013</td><td>&euro;95</td><td>&euro;285</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;66</td><td>&euro;205</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The age-related credits provided under the scheme amounted to &euro;333m in 2011 and &euro;436m in 2012.  The HIA's  published figures for the scheme in 2013 show that the RES credits paid to insurers by the RES Fund was &euro;299.42m, plus &euro;112.58 balance from the ARTC scheme, giving a total of &euro;412m.  The amounts paid to individual insurers is commercially sensitive information, however it may be available in the published accounts of the individual insurers.  The comparable figures for 2014 will be included in the RES Fund accounts which will be published by the Health Insurance Authority in mid-2015.</p></reply>

The report has been misrepresented in some quarters, quoting a finding that between 2010 and 2013 there appeared to be a slight rise in the proportion of people aged 12&ndash;17 smoking daily.  However, the report itself points out that this increase in daily smoking was not statistically significant and that the trend for those aged 12&ndash;17 should be interpreted with caution due to a high relative standard error.<br/><br/>I find the report hugely encouraging in that it found that in Australia, 95% of 12-17 year olds have never smoked.  Of greater importance was the finding that there has been a statistically significant decrease in daily smokers aged 14 years or older in Australia, falling from 16.6% in 2007, 15.1% in 2010 to 12.8% in 2013.<br/><br/>The protection of children is one of the main themes of <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>.  Ireland has also experienced a decrease in the numbers of children smoking in recent years.  The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (2010) found that 27% of children reported that they had ever smoked tobacco - a decrease of nine percentage points since the 2006 Survey, in which 36% of children reported that they had ever smoked.  In the survey, 12% of children aged 10-17 reported that they were current smokers; which again represents a decrease since the figure of 15% recorded in 2006.<br/><br/>The year 2025 has been identified as the date on which Ireland will become tobacco free, i.e. with a smoking prevalence of 5% or less.  It is anticipated that the recommendations made in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland </i>will make a significant contribution to achieving this target.</p></reply>

SOLAS with the assistance of relevant experts such as the ESRI, employers and local and national organisations have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development.<br/><br/>  One of the core objectives under the new Performance Framework for the higher education system is meeting Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills areas through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.  Higher Education institutions also engage with enterprise at a local level with a view to the development of programmes tailored to local enterprise needs as well as arranging appropriate work placements etc. <br/><br/>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is funded by my Department advises the Irish Government on current and future skills needs of the economy. It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise. Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme. A new call for Springboard 2015, to include the ICT skills conversion programme, issued on the 28th January.  A guidance document, prepared by EGFSN, on current and future skills needs of enterprise accompanied the call. The skills needs of enterprise identified for course proposals under Springboard 2015 are in areas such as ICT, Manufacturing, Skills to Trade Internationally, Entrepreneurship, Freight Transport, Distribution and Logistics and International Financial Services.<br/><br/>The first National Employers Survey which was undertaken in 2012, by the HEA and IBEC showed that 75% of employers expressed confidence that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and the relevant knowledge in their subject and discipline. The second round of this survey was carried out during 2014 by the HEA and SOLAS.  The results of the second National Employers Survey will be published shortly.<br/><br/>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to develop a new National Skills Strategy.  The development of the strategy will provide an opportunity to determine the volume, type and mix of skills required to meet the Government's goal of full employment by 2018 and the challenges to be addressed to achieve this.</p></reply>

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.<br/><br/>  Following decisions of the last Government, as part of the December 2010 budgetary process, Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching now receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools. This is in keeping with the policy of inclusion and the 2006 report. <br/><br/>  The General Allocation Model, which provides additional learning support and English as an additional language allocations for primary schools, was updated for all primary schools from the 2012/13 school year and now includes the Traveller pupils who had previously been supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller (RTT) posts.<br/><br/>  Limited alleviation measures were put in place to assist schools who had high concentrations of Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/hours, in the context of the limited resources available. <br/><br/>  A total of 141 posts have been allocated to schools for this purpose. 81 posts were also provided to readjust Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) allocations to include Traveller pupils previously supported by Resource Teacher for Traveller posts.<br/><br/>  38 alleviation posts were provided for schools that had high numbers or concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts and a further 22 alleviation posts were allocated to schools who had the highest percentage of traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, in comparison to other schools, taking into account their overall pupil populations, and who had not qualified for the first round of alleviation posts.<br/><br/>  This Government has been resolutely committed to protecting, and where possible, increasing, the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas. It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.<br/><br/>  Some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget.<br/><br/>  365 new Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts and 480 resource teaching posts have been provided to support children with special educational needs in schools in 2015, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation in 2015 to 11,330 posts and the total number of resource teaching posts to 6,705. Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available. This is the highest level of SNA and resource teaching allocations that we have ever had, and will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<br/><br/>  With regard to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, a number of sections have been commenced, including those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to education of children.<br/><br/>  The NCSE report on 'Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools' which was published in 2013 and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, recommends that the EPSEN Act be fully implemented as soon as possible. The report also states that the NCSE recognises that the current economic climate makes it unlikely that the Government will be able to implement this recommendation in the short to medium term.<br/><br/>  It is intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p></reply>

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with the broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social. <br/><br/>  The processes span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. <br/><br/>  Well-being Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <br/><br/>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE , Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. <br/><br/>  The Amber Flag initiative is one of a range of external resources and initiatives that are available to assist, among others, schools in supporting various aspects of a positive mental health process. Unfortunately my Department is not in a position to endorse each individual initiative, and it is a matter for schools to determine which of these resources they choose to access. My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement the guidelines documents effectively and when considering collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should be cognisant of DES Circular 0023/2010 which provide advice on best practice for Social Personal and Health Education. <br/><br/>I would nonetheless commend Suicide Aware for its initiative in this regard and wish them success in this venture.</p></reply>

However, while there has been significant consultation in relation to the proposed new model, there has not been sufficient time to address fully all of the concerns which have been raised in advance the September 2015 school year. <br/><br/>  In particular, a robust mechanism for identifying children with complex special educational needs has yet to be finalised.  Similarly it will be important to ensure that the concerns that successful schools continue to receive appropriate levels of support to ensure that their successes can be maintained are addressed. <br/><br/>  In relation to concerns about the removal of professional diagnosis as a basis for the allocation of teaching supports, the response from schools, parents, disability groups, and all other stakeholders who participated in the consultation process has been overwhelmingly positive to this NCSE recommendation.  The view from schools is that, while the professional diagnosis is important in determining whether a specific disability exists, it provides little assistance in understanding the actual learning needs of individual children.  In addition, the reliance on the professional diagnosis can often mean significant delays in providing access to additional teaching support. The proposed new model would eliminate this delay.  <br/><br/>  While the proposed new model is not proceeding for the coming year, it is not the case that the proposed new model would deny children access to additional support based on their needs. <br/><br/>  Under the current model which will be in place for the coming school year, schools will be allocated support calculated on the basis of the numbers of qualifying applications which are received by the NCSE.  The current model does not entitle an individual child to a quantum of hours as, under the model the allocation is  made to the school for the benefit of all children with special educational needs. <br/><br/>  Work will continue in the coming months to develop the proposed model and to address the range of concerns which were identified through the consultations which have taken place so far. <br/><br/>  I have asked my Department to design a pilot of the new model which schools could opt into on a voluntary basis.  Continuing consultation with stakeholders will be a vital part of the ongoing work.  <br/><br/>  The Deputy will also be aware that this week I also announced the establishment within the National Council for Special Education of a new Inclusion Support Service to assist schools in supporting children with special educational needs.  This service will include the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTSVHI) which until now have been managed by the Department.  This change is to take immediate effect and is consistent with recommendations of NCSE reports and with the review of the VTSVHI.<br/><br/>  This change will mean that schools will receive a better and more integrated service from this new Inclusion Support Service.  The Inclusion Support Service will build on the existing good work and support which NBSS, SESS and VTSVHI provide to children and their families as well as to teachers and schools and which will continue as normal as the new arrangements are put in place. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-02-12a.642.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015021200073#WRW01300"><p>Article 42.1 of the Constitution acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the right of parents in this regard. <br/><br/>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<br/><br/>Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. <br/><br/>  Article 44.2.4 of the Constitution states that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations, nor be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school.  In this regard, Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), provides that no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.  Therefore, parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction. <br/><br/>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive.  It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed.  Drafting of the Bill is currently at an advanced stage and the Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring/Summer session.<br/><br/>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  The draft Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<br/><br/>  The Bill and its associated regulations should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents. </p></reply>

FETAC is therefore no longer an awarding body.  Awards previously granted by FETAC are included in the ten-level National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) for Ireland.  FETAC awards fall into levels 1 &ndash; 6 of the NFQ. <br/><br/>  As National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) occur at a number of different levels on the UK's Qualifications Framework, they are therefore considered comparable to different levels of Ireland's NFQ.  Without specific details of the NVQ in question, it is not possible to identify the comparable level on Ireland's NFQ.  <br/><br/>  Through the Irish centre of the European Network of Information Centres/ National Academic Recognition Information Centre (ENIC-NARIC), also known as the Qualifications Recognition Service, QQI offers advice on the general academic recognition of foreign qualifications in Ireland.  Advice on a number of UK qualifications, including NVQs, are included in the Qualifications Recognition Database, accessible at the QSearch facility at www.qqi.ie.  The publication 'Qualifications Can Cross Boundaries: A Rough Guide to Comparing Qualifications in the UK and Ireland' might also be useful, and this too is available at the website indicated above.</p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.</p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme includes an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process.</p>  <p>  My Department has taken note of the concerns expressed. While Pobal will manage the Scheme on behalf of my Department, it is important to note that my Department will retain responsibility for the strategic policy direction of the Scheme. It will also have an oversight role in relation to Pobal&rsquo;s delivery of the Scheme, and will ensure that the valuable community support for elderly persons provided by the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups across the country will be maintained.</p>  <p>The new arrangements will allow my Department to concentrate on developing and improving the Scheme. This will enhance the outcome for both beneficiaries and community groups.</p></reply>

However, the data currently available does not provide a specific breakdown in respect of Shared Ownership Mortgages.  A data collection process is currently underway, referred to further below, which will provide information in that regard . The statistics on local authority mortgage arrears generally are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>by clicking &ldquo;Mortgage Data/Arrears in Local Authorities&rdquo; under the Housing Loans contents.<br/><br/>In 2013, the Housing Agency was asked to conduct a standalone review of the shared ownership scheme, including identification of the main difficulties and recommendations for mitigating measures. An initial draft of the review was received from the Agency and a number of issues were identified that needed further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact of possible mitigating measures. This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. <br/><br/>Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress, such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders. It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review.<br/><br/>My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014. Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.</p></reply>

Local authorities are obliged to include, in Note 11 of their Annual Financial Statements, data showing the closing balances for development contributions. The overall Development Contributions balances, as provided in the table below, comprise both cash and debtors and include adjustments for movements in bad debt provisions. The data provided relates to the balance at 31 December 2012, which is the latest fully audited information available.   It should be noted that local authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and therefore recognise income as earned / billed and not just as cash received. Audited data in relation to 2013 should be available shortly.   </p>  <p>  Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the general government deficit limit, the local government sector&rsquo;s impact on the General Government Balance (GGB) is required to deliver a neutral position each year. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves. However, within these overall limits, there is additional capacity for new non-mortgage borrowing and the expenditure of capital balances on hand by local authorities, which must be sanctioned by my Department. In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.  </p>  <p>The development levy balances of all local authorities as at 31 December 2012 are as follows:</p></reply>

The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.There have been two REFIT schemes that provide support to onshore wind: the REFIT 1 scheme for which state aid approval was obtained in September 2007, and the REFIT 2 scheme which opened in March 2012. The support rates in euro per Mega watt hour generated for each scheme are as outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>Technology</th><th>2015 Tariffs per MWh (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>Large Wind (above 5MW)</td><td>69.72</td></tr><tr><td>Small Wind (equal or less than 5MW) </td><td>72.167</td></tr></table><br/><br/>The REFIT schemes are supported through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy which is a levy on all electricity customers and is the overall support mechanism for a number of different renewable and non-renewable security of supply plant. There was 1,874 MW of REFIT renewable generation capacity included in the 2014/15 PSO levy period which represents the total megawatts which have become eligible for REFIT payments. Overall, the total projected PSO amount set for the 2014/15 PSO period for the renewable support schemes is &euro;94.3 million out of a total PSO levy of &euro;350.4 million for this period.<br/><br/>There are also tax relief based incentives available such as the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Scheme which allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year and additional relief in future years if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D). The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and may thus be suited to small industrial renewable energy projects. A number of financial services companies offer EII Funds or portfolios to investors.<br/><br/>The Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme was first introduced in 2008 and extended in Budget 2015 for a further three years. The scheme allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies, against their tax liabilities in year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period, thus aiding their cash flow.</p></reply>

I propose therefore to reply only in relation to hydrocarbons and mining which are in my remit.    Profits from Ireland&rsquo;s three producing gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25% (double the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income) and royalties are payable to the State from two of these, the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields, at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields. </p>  <p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. The rental fees figure for 2014 for the three gas fields totalled &euro;0.77 million. The royalties received in 2014 from the two gas fields, and attributable to production in the period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014, was &euro;1.98 million. The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through the 25% corporation tax on profits. </p>  <p>  There is no commercial production of oil in the Irish offshore.</p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that tax rates in respect of new licences should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in the application of maximum rate of 55% in the case of new licences. My Department is working with the Department of Finance and Revenue Commissioners to give operational effect to this approach.</p>  <p>  A report on the non-petroleum mineral sector carried out by independent economic consultants Indecon in 2013 showed that mineral exploration and mining companies contributed a total of &euro;56.6 million in tax and other payments to the Exchequer and to local authorities during 2012. In addition, the State benefits from payments made by mining and prospecting licence holders in the form of royalties, licence fees and other payments. The most recent figures availble for these payments are for 2014, when &euro;6.45 million was received in total, comprising Prospecting Licence fees of &euro;0.34 million, and royalties and rents from State Mining facilities totalling &euro;6.11million. Profits from mining are taxed at 25%. </p>  <p>  Several factors impact on the level of State take from a producing gas field or mineral mine, such as the wholesale price of gas and the global price of mineral commodities, which are subject to significant movement over time, as are production levels. As such attempting to accurately estimate future State receipts over the next ten years would be a speculative exercise. </p>  <p>The amount paid in taxation in respect of Ireland's producing mines or gas fields is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners and not one in respect of which I have a function.  </p></reply>

This clearly demonstrates the success of this scheme. Nevertheless, the SEAI continues to examine the measures available under this scheme with a view to increasing uptake by new entrants and encouraging householders who have previously benefitted from grant support to undertake deeper retrofit work on their homes. This underlines the importance of the Better Energy Homes Scheme in helping people to reduce their energy costs and improve the comfort of their homes. </p></reply>

This has seen increased amounts of biofuel used in Ireland since the scheme was introduced and, in 2013, approximately 150 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish transport fuel market. </p></reply>

The objective is to encourage such organisations to put in place programmes to combat the scourge of suicide and promote positive mental health.  The Amber Flag scheme is one in which the flag is earned following the introduction of mental health programs for young people within an organisation.

Vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub is important as wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity and therefore a review of the current legislation was initiated to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced. <br/><br/>Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 of the Acts and I announced, last year, a consultation process which provided that opportunity with a deadline for the receipt of submissions by 9 January 2015. <br/><br/>I have established a Working Group within my Department to consider all submissions received by this deadline. I have asked the Working Group to report back to me with a range of proposals promptly.<br/><br/>Once the process is complete, I intend to launch a public awareness process so all stakeholders, including local authorities, landowners and members of the public, are fully informed as to the restrictions under the Wildlife Acts.<br/><br/>Any changes to the closed period for cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation would require amending legislation.

The aim of the commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising is to have a rich diversity of programmes and events, complementary and additional to formal state occasions, which will run throughout 2016. In this regard, I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.<br/><br/>The <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>initiative, which I am leading, aims to develop, coordinate and deliver a programme to honour and remember those who fought and died in the 1916 Easter Rising.  The <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>initiative will reflect on the legacy of that period and look towards our future, based around 5 themes, as set out in the Government's framework plan:<br/><br/>- Remembering the past<br/><br/>- Reconciling and respecting all traditions<br/><br/>- Presenting Ireland to the world<br/><br/>- Imagining our future<br/><br/>- Celebrating our achievements.  <br/><br/>The dedicated <b><i>Ireland 2016</i></b>Project Team in my Department is currently engaged in an extensive consultation process across the Government, State agency and community sectors in order to progress the development of detailed plans for the commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  Meetings have taken place between the team and the various key Departments, agencies, local authorities and other interested parties and I am delighted at the level of interest and enthusiasm for the programme to date.  I envisage that this formal consultation phase will be complete by end-February, but engagement will, of course, be ongoing with interested parties as the programme develops towards implementation.  <br/><br/>In this regard, I have secured an allocation of &euro;4 million in current funding to support the development of an integrated national plan focused on the commemoration of the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.

I am advised that a payment of &euro;1,500 in respect of Year 1 of 15 (2011), &euro;1,500 in respect of Year 2 of 15 (2012) and &euro;1,518 in respect of Year 3 of 15 (2013) have been made to this applicant. In addition, a once-off payment of &euro;500 has been made to the applicant in respect of the signing of a legal agreement under this scheme.</p>  <p>  It has come to the attention of my Department that the turf plot on which the applicant now claims to have been extracting turf is different to the one which she had indicated that she had been extracting turf from on her application form. My Department has been assessing the details in relation to this plot to ascertain if the qualifying criteria of the scheme have been met in this instance. </p>  <p>  A letter has recently been sent to the applicant seeking additional information including evidence of a legal interest in this plot. Once this information is received my Department will complete its assessment of the application and will be in further contact with the applicant.</p></reply>
