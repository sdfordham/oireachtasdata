I have regular meetings with my senior officials, including our Permanent Representative to the EU and our Ambassador in London, to discuss developments in the negotiations and these meetings have intensified in recent weeks.  I also have frequent meetings with my officials on specific issues as the need arises and my office maintains a regular line of contact with the core team in my Department working on Brexit issues, as well as with senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach and other relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  Our Permanent Representation in Brussels and our Embassies in all EU Member States ensure that I am kept informed of the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our EU partners and their views in relation to the Irish-specific issues.  My officials based in Belfast and in Armagh also keep me informed of ongoing contacts in Northern Ireland on Brexit-related issues.</p>  <p>  Since I took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in June of this year, my priority has been to ensure that, not only am I kept fully briefed on the Brexit negotiations and on the border issue, but that - working closely with the Taoiseach and Minister of State McEntee - I am actively engaged in what is an existential matter for this island.  I have taken time to meet with and hear from people in businesses and community organisations in Northern Ireland and the border region to deepen further my own understanding of this complex situation.  The All-Island Civic Dialogue has also been invaluable in this regard.</p>  <p>  Through all of this, I believe that the position being taken by the Government in relation to the border issue is the correct one.  This approach proved successful in achieving our goals in phase one.  These goals include the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, protection of the Good Friday Agreement including North South cooperation, and protection of EU citizenship and other rights.  We have achieved the most important commitment of avoiding a hard border and the UK has set out in detail how this could be achieved.  In the absence of an agreed solution the UK has committed to maintaining full alignment with the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement including North-South co-operation.  This will ensure that people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods are protected and that communities and businesses in the border region are given every opportunity to develop and prosper.  I therefore look forward to a positive outcome from this week&rsquo;s European Council which will allow the EU-UK negotiations to proceed to phase II. </p></reply>

I will not repeat those again now.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to recognising the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict. Ireland has long looked forward to being able to recognise a sovereign Palestinian state existing in fact and not just in theory.</p>  <p>  Ireland normally recognises states that actually exist and control their territory, and so successive Irish Governments have seen recognition of Palestine coming as part of an overall peace agreement. </p>  <p>  However, in view of the long-term frustration of that ideal, and in particular in the light of the motions passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in 2014, I am also considering whether early recognition now by Ireland of a state of Palestine, in advance of its actual achievement on the ground, could play a helpful part in advancing a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p>  <p>  There are many varied factors bearing on this question. They include the likely impact of such a move on the peace process, the possible value of recognition as a symbolic gesture, the likely impact on other initiatives and perception by other actors, and the likely effect on Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the issue. In addition, should I decide to recommend early recognition to the Government, then as an essentially symbolic action the timing of such a move would also be a matter of careful judgment.</p>  <p>  I have not yet concluded that immediate recognition by Ireland would be a helpful step, but I keep this matter under continuous review, in the light of the views expressed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in 2014. I intend to visit the region again early in the new year, and would expect that this issue will feature in my discussions with the various parties on that occasion. </p></reply>

However, devolved power-sharing government can only operate on the basis of an agreement reached between the two largest parties.  The other parties represented in the Assembly also have a critical role to play.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that, after several phases of negotiations in different formats, we still do not have an agreement to form an Executive.  The issues under discussion go to the heart of the divisions in society in Northern Ireland and agreement on them was always going to be challenging.  However, I have always believed that it remains possible to reach an agreed outcome which ensures implementation of previous agreements and reflects the core principles of the Good Friday Agreement and power-sharing itself - partnership, equality, and mutual respect.  It remains my conviction that this is achievable.</p>  <p>  The continuing absence of devolved institutions in Northern Ireland and of the North South Ministerial Council is all the more serious at this time, when the challenges of the UK exit from the EU need to be addressed.  This needs to be done in a manner which protects the Good Friday Agreement and all of the progress it has enabled us to make in securing the peace and deepening reconciliation between communities in Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between Ireland and Britain.</p>  <p>  The power-sharing Executive and the Assembly are responsible for representing the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland, including in relation to how the issues arising with the UK exit from the EU should be addressed.  It is imperative that the devolved institutions can urgently operate again.  The North South Ministerial Council must also resume its work to oversee and develop North/South co-operation, including that commenced last year to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive on dealing with the challenges raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit.</p>  <p>  I maintain very regular engagement on behalf of the Government with civic society across all communities and regions in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and other Government Ministers also visit Northern Ireland on a regular basis and there is extensive engagement through the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit.  All of this engagement with civic society confirms our view that there is an urgent need and demand for the resumption of the devolved institutions.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  The Taoiseach and I continue to engage with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to give full effect to that commitment.</p>  <p>  The Government is also continuing to work intensively, as part of the EU27, to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement through the Article 50 process.  The negotiations over the last number of months saw a good political understanding develop on all sides of what is required to achieve what is a shared EU and UK objective.  Last Friday, we received firm commitments in the joint report of the EU Task force and UK Government on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, including in relation to North South co-operation and the principle of consent, on the avoidance of a hard border and on the maintenance of the Common Travel Area.</p>  <p>  As the EU-UK negotiations proceed, the Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.</p></reply>

Political fragmentation in Libya has led to a governance vacuum in some areas, but I call on the Libyan authorities to do everything they can to end this horrendous practice.</p>  <p>  The situation in Libya was discussed at the June 2017 Foreign Affairs Council, and at the July Council, my EU colleagues and I adopted Conclusions, which urged the Libyan authorities to improve access to, and conditions in, detention centres, as well as to look for alternatives to detention. At the European Council in October, the Taoiseach conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns on the conditions in detention centres in Libya. He announced that Ireland will double its contribution to the EU Trust Fund for Africa to &euro;6 million, to help address the root causes of migration.</p>  <p>  The EU supports the UNHCR and the IOM efforts to ensure adequate reception facilities for migrants, and provides training in international humanitarian law, human rights and gender issues to the Libyan authorities. The African Union, EU and UN agreed in November to establish a trilateral Task Force to protect the lives of migrants, particularly inside Libya, by accelerating assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin, and resettlement of those needing international protection.  </p>  <p>  Real improvement in the situation of migrants in Libya will require political stabilisation and a return to order. Through the EU, Ireland supports both UN mediation, and regional efforts, to stabilise the situation in Libya.</p>  <p>  The fight to reduce poverty is one of the main drivers of large irregular migratory flows, and remains firmly at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Irish Aid will continue to focus on ending extreme poverty, hunger and under-nutrition.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-13a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300075#WRA02200"><p>The EU has responded to the migration crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through the Migration Partnership Framework; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of an EU Naval Force, Operation Sophia, to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants. EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey.  These measures are bearing fruit and the numbers of migrants risking their lives is down significantly on last year.</p>  <p>  Most migrants to Europe originate in Africa and the EU Trust Fund for Africa, established in 2015, is tackling the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration.  Almost &euro;3.2 billion has been pledged by donors to the Fund for the period 2016 to 2020, with the Irish Government making a commitment of &euro;6 million.  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility, a response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country.  &euro;3 billion has been committed to the Facility by the EU for the period 2016 to 2019, with Ireland providing &euro;22.9 m.  The Irish Navy has also been deployed in the Mediterranean and has to date rescued over 17,500 people.</p>  <p>  Last month, the EU and African Union held a Summit meeting at which they agreed to enhance cooperation on migration.  They announced the creation of a joint African Union, EU and UN Task Force specifically focused on reversing the humanitarian emergency.  The objectives of the Task Force are to save and protect the lives of migrants and refugees along key routes and in Libya, in particular; to accelerate assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin; and the resettlement of those in need of international protection. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been helping to alleviate the suffering of migrants and refugees. In 2016, &euro;194 million, more than one quarter of our ODA, was directed to humanitarian needs, including support for responses to refugee influxes.  This year, Ireland is providing &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to alleviate the effects on civilians of the conflict in Syria, &euro;11 million for South Sudan, &euro;6 million for Somalia, and &euro;4 million for Yemen. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-12-13a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017121300075#WRA02500"><p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development cooperation programme and to its place at the heart of our foreign policy.</p>  <p>  Predictable funding streams allow the effective planning of our assistance so that it can deliver maximum impact, and greatly assists the prudential management of the aid budget.  Multi-annual funding arrangements are the most commonly used mechanism to facilitate predictability of funding and, importantly, to allow the delivery of strategic goals.</p>  <p>  In 2017, over almost &euro;74 million or 80% of Irish Aid&rsquo;s civil society budget is governed multi-annual funding agreements.  The Programme Grant, the largest civil society funding mechanism, runs from 2017 to 2021, and will provide approximately &euro;53 million in funding per year to thirteen NGOs to deliver results.  Only NGOs which reach a certain critical mass qualify for this mechanism: the next round of funding for other, smaller, NGO partners will increase the potential annual grant to assist these partners in achieving the scale required to qualify for Programme Grants.</p>  <p>  While it is more challenging to provide multi-annual funding in the context of humanitarian emergencies, Ireland has committed to providing at least 20% of its humanitarian funding through multi-annual agreements.   </p>  <p>  Our bi-lateral programmes in Key Partner Countries are predominantly based on multi-annual strategies including indicative multi-annual funding commitments. We expect that this strong commitment to multi-annual funding will continue as Ireland progresses towards our 0.7% target by 2030.</p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that a new White Paper on development cooperation would be published next year, most probably in the summer.  One of the issues which will be considered in that context would be how to most effectively plan on a multi-annual basis, with a view to better achieving results. </p></reply>

National legislation imposes a licensing requirement in respect of items on the EU Common Military List, including rifles and shotguns for sporting/hunting purposes.  These applications are assessed on a case by case basis taking account of the EU Common Position, EU sanctions and the Arms Control Treaty.  Licenses have also been granted for &lsquo;dual use&rsquo; items, relating not to arms, but to components such as engine parts and to software.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for issuing licenses.</p>  <p>  As regards the purchase of arms by Ireland from Israel, the acquisition of military equipment by the Defence Forces is the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  I believe that the principal criterion used is the best equipment which can be obtained for the protection and operational effectiveness of Irish troops, and such equipment is often available from a limited number of sources.  </p></reply>

The EU has consistently endorsed reconciliation in successive Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on the conflict.</p>  <p>  Differences and sometimes outright conflict between the disparate Palestinian groups, and in particular the two main organisations, Fatah and Hamas, has obviously weakened the position of the Palestinian people in addressing the problems that surround them.  Conversely, reconciliation could be an essential step in allowing Palestinians to speak with one voice and to negotiate and to deliver on a peace agreement with Israel which would end the occupation.  It could also be crucial to the task, with which we are familiar in relation to our own peace process, of helping bring former militants to support political process to address their grievances.</p>  <p>  In saying this I am fully conscious of continuing problems with the positions, methods and aims of Hamas.  I am also aware of more moderate signals they have given, including of accepting the lead of President Abbas as negotiating on behalf of the Palestinian people, and in pursuit of his objective of a two state solution.  How or whether these divergent impulses can be resolved within Hamas is still to be proven, but the effort is surely one worth making.</p>  <p>  Although the contrary is often asserted, it is not the case that the European Union, or for that matter the United States, refused to accept the results of the 2006 Palestinian elections.  Both parties recognised as legitimate the Palestinian Government subsequently formed by Hamas, but they also exercised their own right to decide whether or in what form to engage directly with members of Hamas while it remained committed to an armed struggle.</p>  <p>  I would be happy to urge support for any Palestinian Government which was committed to the peaceful achievement of a two state solution.</p></reply>

In the case of Syria, the EU sanctions include an oil embargo, restrictions on investments, a freeze of Syrian Central Bank assets and export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression, or for interception of internet or telephone communications. There are no sanctions on food, medicines or most other civilian goods. </p><p>In addition to these measures, targeted EU sanctions are in place against over 250 people and almost 70 entities which are complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria. The first person on this list is Bashar Al Assad, whose forces have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. </p><p>The EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures, state that &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted &hellip;.&rdquo; Accordingly, the EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include specific exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance.<b></b>The EU keeps the impact of sanctions under constant review, and will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict and the Assad regime&rsquo;s actions.  <b></b></p><p>In line with the EU strategy on Syria, the EU will maintain its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues.</p><p>Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. To lift these sanctions would amount to tacit support for the Assad regime and would serve to encourage further impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, and disregard for the UN-led peace process. </p><p>Some of the US measures pre-date the current conflict. However, I understand that the aims of the sanctions that the US has imposed since 2011 include depriving the regime of the resources it needs to continue violence against civilians, and this is a goal shared by the EU.</p></reply>

I am very pleased with the progress so far in the negotiations and we reached a key moment last Friday when we achieved the goals we set out to achieve in phase one.  This includes maintenance of the Common Travel Area, and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts including North/South cooperation.</p>  <p>  Ireland is negotiating as part of the EU27, through the work of the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier and his team.  My officials are in regular contact with Mr Barnier&rsquo;s team and provide all support they can to the work of the Task force in the negotiations, particularly where it concerns the Irish-specific issues, which will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the negotiations in phase two.</p>  <p>  In the lead up to Friday&rsquo;s publication of the joint progress report by the EU and UK negotiating teams and ahead of the European Council decision on sufficient progress, I undertook an intensive round of bilateral contacts with my EU counterparts, to reaffirm the importance of making sufficient progress across all three exit issues, including the Irish-specific issues.  I met with Michel Barnier again in Brussels on 24 November and also met with my counterparts from Poland, Hungary and Spain on the same day, in the margins of the Eastern Partnership Summit. I have spoken to a number of my counterparts by telephone over the past week, including with my colleagues from Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal and Slovakia.  I also joined the Taoiseach in his meeting with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in Dublin on Friday 1 December.  There has also been extensive engagement with EU partners by Minister of State McEntee and at official level.  These strategic engagements will continue as the Brexit negotiations move into phase 2. </p>  <p>  My most recent meeting with a UK minister was with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  While we had a broad agenda, it provided the opportunity to exchange views on the exit negotiations.  The Taoiseach and my cabinet colleagues engage regularly with our UK counterparts on a range of issues unrelated to Brexit, but have used these opportunities to restate the EU position on the negotiations and to reaffirm that the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU are through the agreed structures in Brussels.</p>  <p>  One of the key priorities of the Government in these negotiations has been to ensure that the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement are fully protected.  This is a shared objective of the EU and of the UK. Ireland is negotiating as part of the EU27. Any internal consultations on the UK&rsquo;s position in the Article 50 negotiations are a matter for the UK Government.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased that the EU Task Force was able to reach this agreement with the UK government last Friday and that Michel Barnier was in a position to recommend to the Council that sufficient progress has been made on all phase one issues.  Language on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the joint report from the negotiators of the EU and the UK Government reflects our goals of maintaining the Common Travel Area, protecting the Good Friday Agreement and North South cooperation, and protecting EU citizenship and other rights.  I am hopeful that the European Council will agree to start discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship as soon as possible.  The Government will keep working to achieve the best possible outcome for the island of Ireland, our citizens and our economy.</p></reply>

Subsequently, US diplomats have contacted my Department at senior official level, as well as in other capitals, to explain the perspective of the US Government in taking this action.  My officials in turn underlined the deep concerns which I expressed in my statement.</p>  <p>  The European Union, as well as Ireland and many other Member States, have clearly expressed their concerns about, and disagreement with, the decision of the United States, and have restated our own policy that Jerusalem must become the capital of two states, Israel and Palestine. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  The expansion of Israeli settlements, and related policies of dispossession, demolitions and evictions, have been central to Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) for some years.  I have stressed these issues at EU level in discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council and directly in our contacts with the Israeli authorities.  I made a public statement condemning the settlement process on 20 October last. I have also advised the House from time to time on actions taken by my officials in relation to specific communities under threat in the occupied territory.  Most recently, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to settlements again directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu at an informal EU breakfast meeting with him in Brussels on Monday.</p></reply>

The Trust Fund is assisting a band of countries across three regions in Africa that are among the most fragile and affected by migration, namely the Horn of Africa, the Sahel/Lake Chad region, and North Africa.</p>  <p>  Almost &euro;3.2 billion has been pledged by donors for the Trust Fund for the period 2016 to 2020, with 117 programmes across the three regions ongoing and total disbursements to date amounting to over &euro;488 million. Ireland made an initial commitment of &euro;3 million to the Trust Fund, earmarked for the Horn of Africa, and an additional &euro;3 million was recently pledged in response to growing needs.  Ireland&rsquo;s total &euro;6 million contribution covers the period 2016-20. </p>  <p>  The Trust Fund is tackling the root causes of irregular migration and displacement in countries of origin, transit and destination through a range of interventions. First, employment opportunities are being created through economic programmes, especially for young people and women in local communities - with a focus on vocational training and the creation of small enterprises. </p>  <p>  Secondly, basic services for local populations, such as in health and education, are being supported, in particular for the most vulnerable as well as refugees and displaced persons. Thirdly, better management of migration is being assisted so as to enable regions and countries to contain and prevent irregular migration, fight human trafficking, enable effective return and re-admission, and support international protection and asylum. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Trust Fund is supporting improvements in overall governance, in particular by promoting conflict prevention, addressing human rights abuses, enforcing the rule of law, and countering radicalisation and extremism.</p>  <p>  In all of these ways, the EU Trust Fund is delivering an integrated and co-ordinated approach in response to the diverse causes of irregular migration in Africa, and I am glad to note that the recent African Union &ndash; European Union Summit   agreed to further cooperation in that regard. </p></reply>

The pace at with which the need is increasing is very worrying and presents an enormous challenge for the global response.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget has consistently supported responses to humanitarian crises. In 2016, &euro;194 million, more than one quarter of our ODA, was directed to humanitarian responses. </p>  <p>  This year, significant humanitarian funding continues to be provided in response to global need, and I would anticipate that by year-end around one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA will again have been disbursed in direct response to crisis and conflict.  Among the examples of our response this year are &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to alleviate the effects on civilians of the conflict in Syria, &euro;11 million for South Sudan, &euro;6 million for Somalia, and &euro;4 million for Yemen. </p>  <p>  For 2018, the Government has allocated just over &euro;707 million for ODA, the third consecutive annual increase, and humanitarian funding levels similar to those in 2017 have been provisionally allocated for 2018, including through our EU and UN contributions.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also actively engaged in ensuring that the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system is improved, through implementing the commitments of the World Humanitarian Summit and the Grand Bargain, and supporting UN reform.  The Grand Bargain is an agreement among 30 donors, including Ireland, to amongst other things deliver an extra US$1 billion in aid by 2020 through improved working practices.  In 2018, we will continue to pursue this through, for example, our membership of the UN CERF (Central Emergency Response Fund) Advisory Board and the WFP Executive Board. </p>  <p>  However, as well as supporting humanitarian response, we recognise that tackling the factors driving humanitarian need is the only way to ultimately end it.  Through our multilateral and bilateral engagements, this Government remains committed to addressing the causes of humanitarian need, in particular through supporting conflict resolution and through our consistent investment in development, in particular but not exclusively in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries. </p></reply>

There are currently 29,652 applications in progress.  These are applications that are going through the normal checking process rather than a backlog.</p><p>While the volume of applications in progress remains high, the turnaround time for applications submitted through Passport Express for first-time applications, renewal applications and applications for renewal of lost, stolen or damaged passports remains at 15 working days . Applications received through Online Passport Application Service can be processed more quickly, with current turnaround times of approximately 5 working days.</p><p>The fact that target turnaround times for Passport Express renewal and first-time applications are being met despite the significant increases in volumes of applications in the year reflects the hard work and professionalism of Passport Service staff.  Service improvements, such as the introduction of the Online Passport Application Service that launched this year, have also made a major contribution to the effective management of these exceptionally high volumes.</p><p>Tracking of applications is in general carried out against method of application.  The Passport Service does not compile data on any other citizenships that an applicant may hold.  In order to meet the requirements of the Passports Act 2008, each applicant must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in their application.  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by Irish law and in particular, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Irish citizens are not prohibited from holding foreign citizenship in addition to their Irish citizenship.</p><p>For the period January 1 to December 4 this year, the number of passport applications received from applicants living in Great Britain was 66,054, with 69,094 coming from applicants living in Northern Ireland.  This compares with figures of 48,765 and 61,104 respectively for the same period in 2016.<b></b>My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources, including staffing, are effectively deployed.</p></reply>

Such measures can cover a variety of elements including financial services (e.g. asset freezes), immigration (visa and travel bans) and trade (e.g. export restrictions).</p>  <p>  The objective in adopting sanctions is to bring about a change in policy and/ or behaviour by the target of the measures.  For example sanctions may be applied in response to repression, human rights abuses or violations of international law.  As such, sanctions are an important foreign policy tool and a part of an integrated and comprehensive approach to the pursuit of foreign policy objectives including safeguarding security and preserving peace, conflict prevention, and the support of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and international law.</p>  <p>  Sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council are binding on all United Nations Member States. They are subject to EU measures in order to ensure their consistent implementation throughout the EU.  The EU may also adopt its own sanctions, known as autonomous EU measures, as a tool of its Common Foreign and Security Policy. </p>  <p>  These sanctions are targeted to minimise the consequences for those not responsible for the actions that have triggered them, e.g. the local civilian population.  For example, economic sanctions often take the form of asset freezes for targeted individuals rather than blanket economic restrictions on a country.   A key principle of EU sanctions is that they must respect fundamental human rights and fundamental freedoms, with a particular emphasis on the right to due process. In addition, where appropriate, EU sanctions regimes include exemptions and derogations to ensure mitigation of any unintended humanitarian consequences. </p>  <p>  Restrictive measures in force are kept under constant review to ensure that they continue to contribute towards achieving their stated objectives.  Ireland engages fully in this process at EU level. </p></reply>

I maintain regular engagement on behalf of the Government with civic society across all communities and regions in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and other Government Ministers also visit Northern Ireland on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  I have most recently had the opportunity to discuss the impact of Brexit with civil society groups during my visit to Belfast on 22 November.  This and other visits provide the opportunity to discuss concerns regarding the impact of Brexit on lives and livelihoods across Northern Ireland and I will be continuing this engagement in the period ahead. </p>  <p>  In addition, many civil society organisations in Northern Ireland continue to participate in the All-Island Civic Dialogue process.  The All-Island Civic Dialogue was launched in November 2016 in order to have the widest possible conversation with civil society groups, trade unions, business groups, non-governmental organisations and political parties across the island of Ireland. Since then, three plenary dialogues and twenty sectoral dialogues have taken place in locations across the country to discuss the impact of Brexit on specific areas including agrifood, Transport, Energy, Tourism and Hospitality and Education.  The most recent sectoral dialogue on energy took place in Dublin on October 26.  These dialogue meetings have enjoyed strong participation from civil society groups, North and South. </p>  <p>  At the last plenary meeting of the All-Island Civic Dialogue in September of this year, Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement was the principal focus of a session on citizens.  This session highlighted that there is a need for politics and civil society to come together and discuss the cross-community impact of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  The overwhelming message was that, in discussions around Northern Ireland and Brexit, protecting and developing the gains of the peace process must be the main priority.  This is reflected in both the Government and EU position on Northern Ireland in protecting the hard won gains of the peace process and avoiding border infrastructure of any kind on this island. </p>  <p>  In this regard, we are pleased with the agreement that was reached between PM May and President Juncker last Friday which represents significant progress for Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the EU-UK negotiations.  This includes maintaining the Common Travel Area, protecting the Good Friday Agreement and North South cooperation, and protection of EU citizenship and other rights.  I sincerely hope that the European Council will make the decision tomorrow to move to phase two of the negotiations.  The Government will continue its work on Irish-specific issues in a distinct strand of phase two of the negotiations as part of the EU27. </p>  <p>  I will continue engagement with civil society groups North and South as the negotiations progress.</p></reply>

We will also work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the European Union.</p>  <p>  There are already a number of channels for ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the Irish and British governments, which will continue after the UK leaves the European Union.  In this regard, the Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional co-operation on an east-west basis through the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference (BIIGC) and the British Irish Council (BIC).  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.</p>  <p>  These structures have shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.  The British Irish Council continues to work on areas of shared importance, with the Taoiseach and Minister McHugh attending the most recent British Irish Council Summit meeting in Jersey in November.  Three of the four British Irish Parliamentary Assembly Committees carried out inquiries into the consequences of the UK exit from the EU for various sectors across this island, meeting with practitioners and stakeholders to hear evidence and further the discourse around this issue of primary importance.</p>  <p>  Other channels of contact and cooperation have developed over the years as the relationship between these islands has grown closer.  For example, in 2012, a process was established involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in both London and Dublin.  </p>  <p>  Deputies will also be aware of ongoing contact between Government Ministers and their UK counterparts across a range of policy areas.  I recently welcomed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Dublin where, in addition to Brexit, we had the opportunity to discuss a number of areas of mutual foreign policy interest.</p>  <p>  I am therefore confident that existing structures will provide ample opportunity for positive dialogue between our two Governments.</p></reply>

Our priority has always been to ensure that the gains of the peace process and the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, are not harmed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  This objective is shared by our EU partners, the UK Government and the parties in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  We welcome the joint report of the negotiators of the EU and the UK and, in that regard, we have secured an important commitment from the UK and EU.  Crucially, the UK has reiterated that there will be no physical border infrastructure or related checks on the island of Ireland and sets out in detail how this can be achieved.  We have a stated commitment from the UK to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government has always said that we would see the UK as a whole staying in the single market and the Customs Union as the best possible outcome for Northern Ireland and for East-West trade.  The joint report spells out the UK&rsquo;s intention to avoid any hard border through a comprehensive future EU-UK relationship. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied, therefore that in all eventualities, a hard border will be avoided and North South cooperation protected.  This is something that every political party on our island supports.  There is a great deal of work still to be done on the Irish-specific issues in order to ensure that all of the commitments set out in the joint report are implemented.  I am therefore pleased that work on Irish issues will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the EU-UK negotiations in phase two.

Dealing with long-outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland are of the utmost importance to the Government.  The Programme for a Partnership Government highlights this priority, with specific reference to implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p> The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  I have spoken directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, about this matter and am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also advised the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

This is an important fail safe, recognising that to avoid a hard border, no matter how it is achieved, Northern Ireland or the UK as a whole will need to remain fully aligned with necessary rules of the Customs Union and the Single Market.</p><p>&ldquo;Alignment&rdquo; is a term used in EU law in the context of adherence to the <i>acquis communautaire.  </i>A hard border is not necessary today because Northern Ireland and Ireland are fully aligned with the <i>acquis communautaire </i>or<i></i>EU rules.  To &ldquo;maintain full alignment&rdquo; therefore requires the UK to continue to adhere to all elements of EU Internal Market and Customs Union law which supports the fundamentally important goals set out above.  This will have to continue to be the case unless and until such time as there is an alternative solution in place that can continue to meet our shared goal of avoiding a hard border.  I am satisfied by this firm commitment from the UK.</p><p>In the next phase, the EU will work with the UK to ensure that, under all eventualities, a hard border is avoided.

As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has a solemn responsibility to protect the Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the Peace Process which have been of immeasurable benefit to the entire island, north and south.</p>  <p>  Upholding the Good Friday Agreement is also an objective shared by the British Government.  Last Friday, we received firm commitments in the joint report of the negotiators of the EU and UK Government.  These commitments include the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, protection of EU citizenship and other rights, and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts including in relation to North South co-operation and the principle of consent.</p>  <p>  This agreement not only provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border in any circumstances, it spells out for the first time how this will be achieved.  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, paragraph 49 of the report states that, &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo;  It has also been agreed that any agreements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight. </p>  <p>  The British Government has proposed a number of pieces of draft legislation relating to the UK&rsquo;s Withdrawal from the European Union, which are being considered at Westminster.  While this is a matter for the UK Parliament, my Department, including through the Embassy in London, is actively following the progress of these bills at Westminster.</p></reply>

He urged the Government of Myanmar to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State in full and to allow the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of the people that have fled their homes.</p>  <p>  While there, he also met with a range of Government, UN and civil society organisations to learn at first hand of the work they are doing and the challenges they face.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also continued to engage on this issue at the United Nations and was an active participant in the Special Session of the Human Rights Council that took place in Geneva on 5 December, where Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva outlined our concerns.  At that session, Ireland supported a resolution expressing alarm and grave concern at the situation and calling on the Myanmar government to ensure the protection of the human rights of all persons in Myanmar, including persons belonging to the Rohingya Muslim community and other minorities.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage at a national level, through our EU membership and with the broader international community to press for a positive and long-term solution to the situation in Rakhine State, including for the Rohingya community, and for the significant number of refugees who are now situated in Bangladesh.</p></reply>

In 2016, over half of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral ODA was directed to Least Developed Countries. In the same year, eight of the top ten recipient countries of Irish development assistance were in Africa &ndash; seven of which are classified as fragile by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.</p><p>Ireland is also committed to providing support to people and countries experiencing humanitarian crises. In 2016, more than one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development aid was spent on humanitarian response. It is anticipated that by the end of 2017 approximately one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA will again have been disbursed in direct response to crisis and conflict.  A Country Categorisation of Needs method which ranks crises according to risk and needs is used to ensure that our humanitarian response is focused on areas where need is greatest. </p><p>All countries in the broader Horn of Africa region - apart from Djibouti - currently fall within Categories 1 and 2, the categories where the greatest need has been identified. As a result, Ireland provides substantial humanitarian assistance to South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Sudan. </p><p>In addition, significant resources are committed to vulnerable and crisis affected communities in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  Forgotten crises, such as in Chad, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are also prioritised for support.</p><p>High standards of accountability are continually maintained to ensure that Irish development assistance continues to have transformative impacts. Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular monitoring to ensure intended results are being achieved and resources have been used appropriately.  </p><p>Full details of the distribution of our aid, and the results achieved, are published each year in our Annual Report. The 2016 Annual Report is available at www.irishaid.ie.</p></reply>

Engagement with third countries to prevent violent extremism and to strengthen their capacity to detect and prevent terrorism, in full compliance with international law and human rights, remains at the core of the EU&rsquo;s strategy.</p><p>The EU has also placed considerable emphasis on strengthening co-operation with its immediate neighbours in the Western Balkans, Turkey and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries through dedicated political dialogue and the cultivation of effective counter-terrorism partnerships.</p><p>The European Council has also expressed its support for practical cooperation and coordination between the EU and the United Nations in the area of counter-terrorism and has welcomed the establishment in June 2017 of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism by the UN Secretary General.  This office will provide strategic leadership to United Nations counter-terrorism efforts.</p><p>The former UN Secretary General&rsquo;s comprehensive <i>Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism</i>, presented in January 2016, and subsequent reports are an important and welcome contribution to addressing the threat posed by international terrorism.  These highlight the need to examine drivers of violent extremism through dialogue and conflict prevention, strengthening governance and the rule of law, gender equality and empowering women, community engagement and youth empowerment, and education and skills development.</p><p>Two initiatives in which Ireland has been particularly engaged are the effects of violent extremism on Youth and Women, and their role in countering such extremism.  Ireland was strongly supportive of the adoption last year by the Security Council of Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security.  This Resolution confirmed that inclusion and participation by young people must lie at the core of efforts by the international community to respond to crises and conflict.</p><p>Women, Peace and Security is also a key element in the fight against violent extremism. Ireland has long been a supporter of the full implementation of Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security and its successor Resolutions.  Women can have an important role to play in helping to counter radicalisation and extremism in their families and communities, and also have the potential to be radicalised themselves. Therefore, effective Countering Violent Extremism strategies must take cognisance of the particular situation and perspectives of women and girls into consideration.</p></reply>

In the Rome Declaration of March this year, EU Heads of State and Government pledged &lsquo;to listen and respond to the concerns expressed by our citizens&rsquo; and to &ldquo;address the challenges of a rapidly changing world.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The EU has emerging from a period of crisis and is moving forward to a new more positive phase.  The setback suffered by populist parties in a number of recent European elections and the return of economic growth to all EU countries have contributed to this new optimism.  To maintain this impetus we need to ensure that the EU is delivering practical improvements to the lives of citizens through policies to promote jobs and growth and by addressing internal and external challenges such as migration and international terrorism. </p>  <p>  The public launch of the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe by the Taoiseach last month marked the formal start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe they want to see evolve.  Our aim is to raise awareness of the issues involved; to encourage participation in the debate; and to use this engagement process to formulate Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider European debate and specifically to President Tusk&rsquo;s Leaders&rsquo; Agenda, an ambitious work programme for the EU for the next two years. </p>  <p>  Engaging meaningfully with our citizens across the Union and responding to their concerns is the best means of ensuring support for our work on EU issues. </p></reply>

This point is being pressed home at the public outreach meetings taking place under the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue initiative launched last month. Moreover, the Irish people are strongly committed to EU membership as has been shown in numerous opinion polls over many years. It is imperative that we use our influence to shape the future direction of the European Union. Each Member State, Ireland included, will be bringing its own contributions to the debate. We will continue to work closely with partners to advance and defend Ireland's interests across the range of policy areas.</p>  <p>  We have undertaken extensive analysis of the consequences of Brexit and our unequivocal conclusion is that our future interests are best served by remaining a fully committed member of the European Union, notwithstanding the UK&rsquo;s departure. </p>  <p>  We do not see any link, nor has any link been suggested by any other Member State, between the solidarity demonstrated by partners in regard to Brexit and our approach to other priority issues.</p></reply>

The situation in Syria continues to be one of utmost concern. The conflict, which is now in its seventh year, has cost an estimated half a million lives.  Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.  Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  An end to the violence is urgently needed in order to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.  The peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria is a foreign policy priority for Ireland. Ireland fully supports the UN-led Geneva peace process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget has consistently supported responses to humanitarian crises.  In 2016, &euro;194 million, more than one quarter of our ODA, was directed to humanitarian need, including support for the response to the crises in Syria and Iraq.  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis alone.  Ireland has fulfilled its pledge to provide at least &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to the region during 2017. Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016.  The EU is also supporting the Turkey Refugee Facility in response to the almost 3 million refugees being hosted in that country. &euro;3 billion has been committed to this by the EU between 2016 and 2019, with Ireland providing &euro;22.9 million. </p>  <p>  In 2015 the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) in response to the humanitarian crisis in Southern Europe as a due to mass migration and people fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.  Under the terms of this programme, administered by the Department of Justice, Ireland has committed to accept up to 4,000 refugees from the region. To date, 1,502 people have already arrived with another 325 people expected to arrive in December and early in the New Year. </p>  <p>  In Iraq, the UN estimates that 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the country begins to recover from the atrocities committed by Daesh.  The current number of internally displaced persons requiring humanitarian assistance stands at almost 3.3 million, of which 1.6 million are living outside of camps in host communities.  In addition, there are an estimated 240,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq.  The EU is working to support the Iraqi government on stabilisation and reconciliation. In areas liberated from Daesh, the EU focuses on demining, the return of internally displaced persons and resilience.  The EU supports an inclusive process of reconciliation, to build a common vision on the future of the country.  Ireland has consistently called for inclusive democratic measures to allow for genuine national reconciliation, in order to create the environment for long-term viable stability in Iraq and the wider region.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, Ireland has provided over &euro;8 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq, including &euro;2 million in 2017 for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.</p>  <p>  Via our annual contributions to the EU budget, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the situation in Iraq, which amounts to &euro;548 million since 2014. </p>  <p>  The situations in both Syria and Iraq were discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on Monday.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in April of this year, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a new strategy for Syria. The EU is currently working on a new EU strategy for engagement with Iraq which will set out our priority actions for the period ahead.</p></reply>

This support includes political efforts to encourage a resumption of direct negotiations, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace.  It also includes action on the ground on human rights and justice issues affecting Palestinians under occupation, including settlement activity, which are progressively endangering the prospects of such a peace agreement.</p>  <p>  In recent months the new United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  This engagement is very welcome, and I have met myself with the US team to encourage their work and to underline to them the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused.</p>  <p>  I was very disappointed at the US announcement recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiating steps to move the US Embassy.  I issued a statement describing this decision as premature and ill-advised, and unhelpful to efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East. High Representative Mogherini issued a similar statement on behalf of the EU. </p>  <p>  In discussions with my EU colleagues, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, I have urged that the EU must continue to encourage an appropriate US initiative, but also that the EU continue our own work, including work on the ground to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two state solution can be achieved.  	I am actively exploring with EU colleagues how this can best be done.</p></reply>

I am supportive of US proposals that ensure tax is not artificially avoided through base erosion or profit shifting, but care is needed so that genuine commercial arrangements are not hit with double taxation which is damaging to economic activity, trade and investment.  It is important that any anti-avoidance measures adopted by the US recognise that international trade between companies and countries is mutually beneficial and should be encouraged.  These are points I made to US legislators during my recent visit to the US.</p>  <p>  My officials, together with our Embassy in Washington, have been closely tracking the debate and progress of the proposed US legislation.  My officials have also been in regular contact with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation as part of efforts to analyse the potential impacts of US tax reform. </p>  <p>  Regardless of what happens with US tax reform, Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.  Ireland remains committed to long-term stability and to the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  As always, we will remain alert and responsive to any changes in the US or global tax environment.</p></reply>

A requirement placed on REITs is that, in general, 85% of their property income is distributed as a dividend to investors each year.  This 85% obligation does not apply in years where the REIT cannot, for example because of an insufficiency of distributable reserves, make a distribution.  Therefore, non-residents are charged to Irish tax on their share of the profits distributed each year.  As such, REITs are not designed to have any significant amount of undistributed property income to which a deemed disposal event could apply. </p><p>Introduced in Finance Act 2016, Irish Real Estate Funds or IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets.  </p><p>The provision addressed the concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property.  The investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.</p><p>IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on certain property distributions to non-resident investors.  The withholding tax will not apply to certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings.</p><p>An IREF taxable event occurs when a unit holder receives value for the accrued profits of the IREF.  In most cases this will be on the::</p><p>- making of a cash or a non-cash distribution to a unit holder; or</p><p>- the cancellation, redemption or repurchase of units from a unit holder;  </p><p>However, the other methods in which value can be realised and which therefore need to trigger the IREF withholding tax are:</p><p>- any exchange by a unit holder of units in one sub-fund of the IREF for units in another sub-fund of the IREF;</p><p>- the issuing of units as paid-up unless new consideration has been received by the IREF;</p><p>- the IREF ceasing to be an IREF or an investment undertaking. </p><p>A deemed disposal rule in the context of IREFs may not be practicable.  </p><p>At Committee and Report stages of the Finance Bill I agreed that certain issues raised in respect of IREFs and REITs would be examined by the Tax Strategy Group.  The Tax Strategy Group papers will be published in Summer 2018. </p></reply>

Its  role in relation to the property was as the secured lender.  The property was owned and managed by the debtor, who had responsibility for the management of the sales process.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the property in question was not sold during the period when the loans were owned by NAMA.  Nor was there a binding legal agreement in place whereby the debtor, who has a right to seek to achieve the maximum value for their assets, was obligated to sell the property to a particular purchaser.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, over a 15 month period, NAMA endeavoured, in good faith, to facilitate the sale of this property by the debtor to an educational institution.  In order to enable the sale to the institution, NAMA approved the sale at an agreed independent valuation in March 2016.  However, the purchaser did not sign the contracts or pay a deposit until December 2016.  I am advised that, by the time NAMA was notified that the purchaser had signed the contracts, the connected loans of the debtor had already been contracted for sale to a third party as part of a multi-connection loan sale which had been openly marketed in a competitive loan sales process.  This loan sale was progressed in keeping with NAMA&rsquo;s statutory mandate to deal expeditiously with its assets.</p>  <p>  I am advised that, after the loans were sold, NAMA was no longer in a position to influence matters relating to the property.  For the avoidance of doubt, contracts for the sale of the property did not exchange during the time that the property was secured to NAMA.</p>  <p>  Lastly, I am advised that where loans relating to a property are sold before an associated asset sale has contracted, the loan acquirer is generally made aware that the property is at "sale agreed" stage.  NAMA have confirmed that this was the case in the transaction referenced by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy will also appreciate that NAMA&rsquo;s involvement with a given property ends once the loans are sold and any future commercial decisions regarding underlying assets are entirely a matter for the loan acquirer and associated debtor. </p></reply>

As such, that Department can be contacted for a full breakdown of their work in Donegal in the aftermath of the flood event in August 2017. </p>  <p>  Homeowners affected by the flooding in August 2017 may be considered for humanitarian assistance for relocation under the 2017 Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme if they also flooded in Winter 2015/2016 and meet the terms of that scheme. My officials are working with Donegal County Council to identify properties in this regard.</p>  <p>  A core element of national flood policy is to assess areas at potentially significant risk from flooding and develop Flood Risk Management Plans through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.  The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. </p>  <p>  There are a number of AFAs in the Finn Valley and Inishowen areas and the details that outline any proposed measures for these AFAs will be included in the Flood Risk Management Plans.  </p>  <p>  The final Plans are currently undergoing an independent review of the strategic level environmental assessments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Once this independent review of all Plans is completed and observations addressed, in early 2018, I expect to seek approval from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform for the 29 Flood Risk Management Plans developed under the CFRAM Programme.  </p>  <p>  Thereafter, I would hope to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those Plans that will be taken, through a prioritised approach over the coming years, to detailed design to protect those communities at assessed risk.</p></reply>

While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified six former stations for reopening, the final outcome of the review has yet to be published.  The Commissioners of Public Works are required to await the result of this review before any decision can be reached on the future use of these closed Garda stations  </p>  <p>  The policy of the Office of Public Works (OPW) with regard to non-operational (vacant) State property, including the former Garda station at Camp, Co. Kerry is to:</p>  <p>  1. Identify if the property is required/suitable for alternative State use by either Government Departments or the wider public sector.</p>  <p>  2. If there is no other State use identified for a property, the OPW will then consider disposing of the property on the open market if and when conditions prevail, in order to generate revenue for the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  3. If no State requirement is identified or if a decision is taken not to dispose of a particular property, the OPW may consider community involvement (subject to a detailed written submission, which would indicate that the community/voluntary group has the means to insure, maintain and manage the property and that there are no ongoing costs for the Exchequer).</p>  <p>  In light of the above, the former Garda station at Camp is therefore not available for use by the local Community Council.</p></reply>

On that basis, the increases in the compulsory retirement age for pre 2004 public servants announced last week will not apply to those groups of public servants.  Retirement ages for those groups will remain a matter for individual consideration in the context of the particular operational considerations arising for such groups, which can best be addressed by the respective Ministers.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream. </p><p>Special classes are sanctioned in mainstream schools for students with special educational needs arising from certain disabilities.</p><p>Enrolment in a special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>In order to access a special class a student must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:</p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special class in question) and</p><p>- S/he has complex or severe learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for organising and planning education provision for children with Special Educational Needs and the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,302 for the 2017/18 school year. </p><p>The number of students in special classes has almost doubled from 3,286 in 2011 to 6,392 in the 2016/17 school year.

My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>- 61% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 13% to attend special schools.</p><p>In order to identify need in any area for forthcoming school years, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class.  In this regard Parents/Guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process.  The report must state that:</p><p>- S/he has ASD</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,300 across the country in 2017, of which 1,042 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.  This reflects the priority which the Government has put on helping children with Special Educational Needs to achieve their potential.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available , in county order, on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Interim Review involved consideration of research findings, both national and international, and a consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders.  The findings of the Interim Review showed that all of the targets set for reading and maths at primary level  in the 2011 Strategy have been reached, in little over half of the Strategy&rsquo;s lifetime, and significant progress has been made towards achievement of targets at post-primary. In light of these findings, the Report of the Interim Review contained new and updated targets, to match my ambition to make the Irish education system the best in Europe by 2026. </p><p>These targets, along with additional actions in priority areas, will help maintain focus on progressing literacy and numeracy achievement to 2020.</p><p>Professional development support for The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020 has been provided in the years 2011 to 2015 by a number of Department funded support services.  These include the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) and the Special Education Support Service (SESS). </p><p>PDST and SESS have supported teacher training with dedicated literacy, numeracy and leadership teams for both the primary and the post-primary sectors.  A comprehensive range of summer courses for primary teachers have also been provided with a focus on Literacy and Numeracy.  Full details of the PDST programme of support 2011 to 2015 is contained in the attached document. </p><p>The acquisition and development of language and the development of modes of communication are the foundations of the development of literacy and numeracy skills of all students and most especially those students with special educational needs.  This has been reflected across the programme of support provided by SESS to teachers of children with special educational needs.  In addition, SESS facilitated an average of 250 specific Literacy and Numeracy seminars for the years 2011 to 2015. </p><p>The National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) delivers a workshop programme for newly-qualified teachers (NQTs).  Their primary literacy programme concentrates on teaching and managing a reading lesson and the primary numeracy workshops places emphasis on developing good practice in mathematics teaching.  The key reference for these workshops is Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life: The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020.</p><p>The Department does not record the number of teacher substitute days which are specific to Literacy and Numeracy events.</p><p>The PDST personnel and programme costs together with SESS personnel costs for the training referenced above are set out in the table<b>. </b>The total annual programme cost for SESS is in the region of &euro;2 million.

In accordance with Section 37(c) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, licensed premises are selected for the purposes of the application of this section, on the basis of location of the premises, complaints received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relative to such premises; the number and kind of contraventions (if any) of the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2008 relating to the premises and / or the clientele attracted to the premises, or any combination thereof. </p><p>The consent of the parent or guardian of a person who is at least 15 years of age but under the age of 18 years is required, in writing, to allow him or her be sent into a licensed premised for the purpose of purchasing intoxicating liquor therein. As advised in responses provided previously to the Deputy, the welfare of test-purchasers involved in the test purchasing operations is paramount. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child<b></b>is relevant in this context.  <b></b></p><p>Article 3 of the Convention provides that<b>t</b>he best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, and administrative measures shall be appropriate to ensure each child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her wellbeing, taking into account the rights and responsibilities of his or her parents or guardians. Institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the established standards, particularly for safety, health, the number and suitability of staff, and competent supervision.</p><p>Reflecting the terms of this Convention and national policy objectives set out in the Children First National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children (&ldquo;Children First Guidelines&rdquo;), the highest possible level of protection for the test purchaser is required. </p><p>Accordingly, when considering the deployment of minors/children for the purpose of a &lsquo;test-purchase&rsquo; operation, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are required to have regard to the following:</p><p>- If at any time during test purchasing operations, a test purchaser indicates that he or she does not wish to continue, or shows signs of distress, the operation must be halted immediately;</p><p>- If, while in the care of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a test-purchaser is injured or suffers loss or damage to his or her property, the incident must be reported without delay to the parent or guardian and the Superintendent in whose area the operation has taken place;</p><p>- Test-purchasing operations are to be organised in such a way as to avoid, as far as possible, the test-purchaser being called as a witness in court proceedings. As a general rule, a witness statement need not be taken from the test-purchaser since a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will accompany the test-purchaser at all times and witness any purchase which may take place. The required witness statement can therefore be provided by the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in any court proceedings arising from test-purchasing operations. Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances, the test-purchaser may be required to attend court as a witness; </p><p>- Parental or guardian agreement and consent for the participation of a test-purchaser must be obtained. </p><p><b></b>Furthermore, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na conducting test-purchasing operations should satisfy themselves that:</p><p>- the safety and welfare of the test-purchaser has been fully considered;</p><p>- any risk has been properly explained to and understood by the test-purchaser;</p><p>- a risk assessment has been undertaken; and</p><p>- a record is kept of the operation.</p><p>If, at any point, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved in the operation considers that it is necessary to halt the operation in order to avoid harm to the welfare of the test-purchaser, the member should do so.</p><p>Divisional Officers in the cited Divisions have indicated that while efforts have been made since the enactment of the legislation, including in the years subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, to conduct test-purchasing operations it has proved difficult to source suitable candidates to act as test-purchasers. When parents have been approached to seek approval to participate in such purchasing operations, such approval was not forthcoming from parents who, while supportive of such initiatives, do not wish their children to be involved, or exposed to any potential risks resulting from such participation. </p><p>Efforts continue to be made to encourage parents to allow their children to participate in operations while, simultaneously, the relevant provisions of the legislation, including the sale or supply, or purchase and consumption of alcohol to / by persons under 18 years of age, continuing to be closely monitored and enforced, with prosecutions for such offences recorded in many Garda Divisions, without the necessity to utilise test-purchasing operations, which would, preferably, to ensure best outcomes, be intelligence-led. </p><p>In other Garda divisions and Districts, through high visibility patrols and engagement with young people, through various activities, including sport, it is the position that the purchase of intoxicating liquor by persons under 18 years of age is not a significant problem, as a result of other proactive policing methods deployed in such District / Divisions, particularly during holiday periods, examination / result times, and other festive periods, when persons under 18 years may attempt to purchase alcohol.  </p><p>The situation continues to be monitored by local Garda Management, in conjunction with the respective Regional Assistant Commissioners, in the context of the ongoing analysis of complaints and crime-trends taking into consideration information / intelligence gathered through routine policing, whereupon the requirement to deploy test-purchasing initiatives will again be re-visited, with a view to identify suitable candidates whose parents are will to permit their participation.</p></reply>

The Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 will be the vehicle through which the agreed recommendations of the Inspectorate Report, the bulk of which have been accepted, will be implemented.  The Modernisation and Renewal Programme draws on over 40 previous reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including from the Garda Inspectorate.  It also draws on the views of the Garda workforce as well as the public.  It is an ambitious five year programme designed to effectively modernise and reform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority, at the request of my predecessor is performing an important task in overseeing this process and in supporting the Garda&iacute; in implementing the reform agenda.  It is required to report to me, as Minister, on a quarterly basis.  To date it has submitted three reports which have been published on my Department's website at www.justice.ie.  I would refer the Deputy to the Authority's third progress report for a comprehensive assessment of  progress on the implementation of the recommendations. The report notes welcome progress in a number of areas including:</p>  <p>  - significant progress in the work of the Garda Victims' Services Offices,</p>  <p>  - the establishment of four Protective Services Units on a pilot basis, </p>  <p>  - the completion of the Garda Deployment Survey,</p>  <p>  - positive progress in the development and implementation of the Divisional/functional model of policing,</p>  <p>  - progress on ICT projects, </p>  <p>  - the Executive Director of Strategy and Transformation has taken up his post,</p>  <p>  - good progress on the implementation of improved risk management.</p>  <p>  As the report makes clear, however, improvements are required in respect of the governance of the reform programme and the pace of implementation.</p>  <p>  I have made it clear to the Commissioner that the concerns highlighted by the Authority must be addressed and the reform programme accelerated to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.  To support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the concerns highlighted by the Authority a structured process of engagement is in place between my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and agree corrective actions.  This engagement includes formal monthly meetings at senior official level with the responsible Deputy Commissioner, the Chief Administrative Officer and the recently appointed Executive Director of Strategy and Transformation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The progress report highlights the critical importance of the Policing Authority's role in delivering the full implementation of the reform agenda.  It brings a capacity to engage intensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and maintain a sustained focus on what is actually being done and what is being achieved on the ground. Its reports reflect this rigorous approach and provide a very solid basis for engagement between my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the programme. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the reform plan that is being pursued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by the Government and overseen by the Policing Authority, has the capacity to achieve this.  It will not be done overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.</p></reply>

Its mission is to drive excellent policing through valued and effective oversight and governance. </p>  <p>  In its independent oversight role in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Policing Authority has engaged actively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the issue of ICT usage, including the use of personal email accounts.  The Authority discussed the matter with the Commissioner at its meetings on 24 November 2016 and on 27 January 2017.  At the latter meeting, a report provided to the Authority by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was discussed.  The minutes of these meetings are available on the Policing Authority website www.policingauthority.ie.    </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the issue has been appropriately dealt with by the Authority and that no further action is warranted on my part at this time.  My Department has therefore neither requested nor received a copy of this report.  As I stated in my previous reply, I continue to have complete confidence that the Authority, with its wealth of experience and expertise, will contribute to making An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a modern, efficient and accountable policing service.</p></reply>

As part of the ongoing management of its property portfolio the Courts Service seeks to dispose of properties that are surplus to its requirements in accordance with its own internal policy and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's policy on property acquisitions and disposals. </p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that it initially considered the property on Boghall Road to be surplus to its requirements and since 2006 has engaged with a number of parties from public, private and community sectors who expressed an interest in acquiring or using the property, including the Jigsaw organisation in 2016.  However, because of the fact that the existing courthouse in Bray town centre is operating at or near capacity, the Courts Service considered it prudent to assess whether the building on Boghall Road could have a role in the delivery of court services in the Bray area in the future.  This assessment is ongoing at present.</p><p><i>Wicklow</i></p><p>The Courts Service has informed me that the courthouse in Wicklow town has been closed for a number of years on health and safety grounds.  However, as part of the Courts Service provincial capital building programme, one of the objectives is to extend and refurbish the courthouse in Wicklow town to provide a significantly larger 4 courtroom venue together with a range of facilities for staff, the judiciary, persons in custody, jurors, legal professionals, other state agencies and members of the public.</p><p>The Courts Service has indicated that while detailed planning or design work has not yet commenced, it has purchased a number of adjacent properties, some of which will be demolished in order to create a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged.  The Courts Service is, at present, considering bringing forward some of these demolition works. </p><p>Wicklow town is one of a number of provincial city/county town venues nationwide still requiring new or upgraded courthouse accommodation and collectively these venues will be the next priority for investment in courthouse facilities outside the capital. </p><p><i>Baltinglass</i></p><p>The Courts Service has also informed me that it stopped using Baltinglass Courthouse as a court venue in 2014.  This courthouse was never vested by the Courts Service and it remains in the ownership of Wicklow County Council therefore the future use of the courthouse is a matter for the Council.</p></reply>

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders; for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Since the Community Text Alert scheme was launched in September 2013, it has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 700 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme.  Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that funding from my Department is not used to provide direct assistance to local Community Alert (or Text Alert) Groups. </p>  <p>  Community Alert funding is allocated by my Department for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers.  These Development Officers, operating in Muintir Na T&iacute;re, provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes.  The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to the Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. </p>  <p>  At the National Ploughing Championships this year, I was pleased to announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate at the Scheme can find more details at www.muintir.ie. </p></reply>

In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. </p><p>This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources he needs to allow him to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Divisional Drug Units for the past 10 years to 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set as follows:</p><p>Strength Cavan/Monaghan Divisional Drug Unit<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Garda&iacute; assigned</th></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2017*</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p><p>*As of 31 October 2017</p></reply>

This new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) will form part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  The Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) will see, over a two year period, up to 530 immediate family members of refugees or beneficiaries of subsidiary protection from established conflict zones come to Ireland as part of our overall commitment to accept 4,000 persons under the IRPP. </p><p>This humanitarian admission programme is an initiative of the Government for the benefit of the families of those in receipt of international protection in Ireland and is not part of any EU programme.  The FRHAP will be operated under Ministerial discretionary powers and it will be in addition to the family reunification provisions provided for in the International Protection Act 2015.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the UNHCR and other stakeholders on developing the full operational details of the programme.</p><p>I will also continue to apply my discretion in the area of family reunification for those outside of the International Protection process in the ways described in the Non-EEA Policy Document on Family Reunification and scheme operated by INIS.</p><p>Additional details on the operation of the FRHAP programme will be announced on the websites of the Department of Justice and Equality<i>(www.justice.ie) </i>and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie) in the coming period.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. </p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 38, 20 and 20 have been assigned to the Cork City Division, the Cork North Division and the Cork West Division respectively.  Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, will increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - a net increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am also pleased that Budget 2018 maintains this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensures that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. This will see Garda numbers reach the 14,000 mark by the end of 2018.  </p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Co. Cork Divisions.  </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength in the Co. Cork Divisions as of 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set as follows:</p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE CORK CITY DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2017</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT </th><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET</td><td>ANGLESEA STREET</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKROCK</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRIDEWELL</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>342</td></tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td>BALLINCOLLIG</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLARNEY</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIG NA BHFEAR</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD</td><td>GLANMIRE</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYFIELD</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>TOGHER</td><td>BISHOPSTOWN</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALINE</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSHAVEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOUGLAS</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PASSAGE WEST</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOGHER</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY TOTAL</td><td></td><td>662</td></tr></table></p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE CORK NORTH DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2017</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT </th><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>FERMOY</td><td>BALLYNOE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLETOWNROCHE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FERMOY</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILDORRERY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILWORTH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MITCHELSTOWN</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHCORMAC</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WATERGRASSHILL</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>MALLOW</td><td>BUTTEVANT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CHARLEVILLE</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DONERAILE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLANTANE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KANTURK</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LISCARROLL</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MALLOW</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MILFORD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWMARKET</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>MIDLETON</td><td>BALLYCOTTON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGTWOHILL</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOYNE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COBH</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLEAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MIDLETON</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WHITEGATE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>YOUGHAL</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>116</td></tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH TOTAL</td><td></td><td>317</td></tr></table></p><p><b>STRENGTH OF THE CORK WEST DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2017</b><table><tr><th>DISTRICT </th><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>BANDON</td><td>BALLINEEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINHASSIG</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BANDON</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>INNISHANNON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILBRITTAIN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINSALE</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TIMOLEAGUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>BANTRY</td><td>BANTRY</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLETOWNBERE</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRIMOLEAGUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DURRUS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLENGARRIFF</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KEALKIL</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SCHULL</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>CLONAKILTY</td><td>BALTIMORE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONAKILTY</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRINAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNMANWAY</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SKIBBEREEN</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>MACROOM</td><td>BAILE BHUIRNE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>B&Eacute;AL &Aacute;THA AN GHAORTHA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BOHERBUE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COACHFORD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROOKSTOWN</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MACROOM</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MILLSTREET</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHMORE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STUAKE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TARELTON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST TOTAL</td><td></td><td>291</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas structure, through its network of 33 overseas offices and its extended Pathfinder (Trade Consultant) network, has the capability of providing client companies with the appropriate support in markets where there are identified opportunities matched by client capability and demand. The activities of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas network are supported by the Market Research Centre and Strategic Marketing Unit based in Dublin, along with a range of financial and capability developments supports aimed at helping client companies to compete and win sales in overseas markets.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU is absolutely critical in terms of global market access, not only to the 27 markets within the single market, but also to third country markets through EU negotiated Free Trade Agreements.  Irish businesses benefit significantly from Free Trade Agreements with third countries in a range of ways, including the elimination of market access barriers and red tape and the abolition of tariffs.  These existing EU agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland in terms of promoting Irish products around the world.  Ireland works actively and closely with the European Commission and other institutions in the negotiation of these agreements, and my Department is responsible for promoting our national policy positions in this regard.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the Government published a new trade strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo; which commits Ireland to deepening our enterprise resilience by intensifying our connections in existing markets and diversify to new markets; capturing new sectoral opportunities; and build more Irish companies of scale.  In this context, Enterprise Ireland is consistently working with client companies focusing on enhancing their competitiveness, capability and levels of innovation to assist them to diversify into new markets.

This Group, which I Chair, meets regularly and oversees the management of our response to the referendum result. It also facilitates regular engagement with the Agencies and Offices of the Department impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Senior Officials Group on Brexit, chaired by the Secretary General, which supports the Management Board of the Department in ensuring a coherent and co-ordinated approach to Brexit across all areas of the Department.</p>  <p>  To facilitate and encourage regular and comprehensive dialogue with enterprise, my Department also established an Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges.  Membership includes 13 representatives from enterprise groups and I Chair the Forum, with meetings held every 6-8 weeks.  This Forum provides an opportunity for the Department to share emerging research and policy approaches with the enterprise sector and to receive feedback on proposals.  It also gives enterprise a platform to share their research and feedback from companies with the Department and to raise issues of concern, to highlight opportunities, and to suggest policy responses.</p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department established a dedicated Brexit Unit to deal with the challenges of Brexit.  The Unit is led at Assistant Secretary level within the EU Affairs and Trade Policy Division, and is supported by one Principal, three Assistant Principals, two Higher Executive Officers and one Clerical Officer.  This Unit leads on the coordination of the Department&rsquo;s policy and operational responses to Brexit, including our approach to the negotiations within the EU and bilateral relations with the UK.  The Brexit Unit oversees research and analysis being undertaken by the Department and its Agencies and monitors research published by external bodies to better inform our policy response.  The Unit also leads on engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to inform and validate our response to Brexit. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010.  The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.  Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. </p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.</p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster for three months.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>These patients were identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and continued to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get this item under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. </p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at .</p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of public funding and AHR treatment, I have received and responded to correspondence from the persons concerned on this matter.  Officials in my Department are developing policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment.  Once I have had the opportunity to consider this policy options paper I will bring a Memorandum to Government for a model of public funding for AHR treatment for the Government's consideration and decision.  It is important to note that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for AHR.</p>  <p>  As you may be aware, the Health Research Board's (HRB) evidence review of international public funding models for AHR was published earlier this year.  This evidence review examines the associated costs and benefits for the funder, provider and patient, the criteria for accessing the public funded service and the basis for these criteria in different jurisdictions.  An analysis of the HRB evidence review will feed into the development of policy options for a potential public funding model for AHR treatment by my officials. </p>  <p>  While IVF treatment is not currently provided by the Irish public health service, there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. </p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.  Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review.</p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies.  The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.  Transport issues for persons under 18 years with a diagnosed disability are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  As the remainder of the Deputy's relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Irish offer was developed by a cross-sectoral working group led by my Department, with colleagues from the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), IDA Ireland and other Government departments and agencies. Our bid was officially submitted to the European Council and the European Commission on 31 July 2017. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department also worked closely with colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the strategy and campaign to promote the bid and demonstrate why Dublin represented a suitable location for the EMA. </p>  <p>  During the course of the campaign, government colleagues, Department officials, and I engaged with representatives from nearly all EU Member States.  These engagements included bilaterals with health ministers across the Member States, discussions between officials at departmental level and briefings for various cross-sectoral stakeholders.</p>  <p>  On 19 November 2017, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the European Union confirmed that Ireland was withdrawing its bid for the EMA in order to focus on the offer for the European Banking Authority, recognising the political challenge of pursuing two bids concurrently.  The decision on the relocation of both agencies was taken by the General Affairs Council on 20 November, with Amsterdam being selected as the new home for the EMA.</p></reply>

However the poor weather resulted in cattle being housed earlier than normal in places, particularly on the heavier soils; it also affected late cut silage making operations.</p>  <p>  I have asked Teagasc to work locally in areas with fodder difficulties, to support good budgeting of fodder supplies on farms for the winter ahead. </p>  <p>  The European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 Basic Payment Scheme.  This has been prompted by the  inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations. This means an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the BPS to those applicants whose applications were confirmed fully clear. Issuing of these payments commenced after 15 October.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of  balancing payments under the BPS scheme has begun and brings the total paid under the Basic Payment Scheme to &euro;1.106 bn, and 121,000 farmers have received a payment to date.  In addition, over 90,000 farmers have been paid a total of &euro;194m under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme to date. Advance payments of &euro;100mn have issued under AEOS and GLAS scheme payments in the last few days.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure a co-ordinated approach I recently convened a fodder group which is made up of all the main stakeholders including representatives of feed industry-co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc and the first meeting took place on Monday 11 December chaired by Teagasc.</p>  <p>  Arising from the meeting, Teagasc are committed to assessing fodder availability in the south of the country to ascertain what supplies are still available for purchase.</p>  <p>  Exploring these avenues means my Department will be fully informed of the situation on the ground and the best possible advice will be provided to farmers re their options.</p></reply>

The decision concluded a lengthy planning process which included an Oral Hearing completed over eleven weeks from March to May of 2016. </p>  <p>  Following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I met with the local opposition groups and members of the Oireachtas in Leinster House on 8 February 2017 to listen to their point of view. </p>  <p>  Motions were subsequently passed in both D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling on the Government to commission an independent report, incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the interconnector and a number of other related issues, and a study is underway to address these issues.</p>  <p>  In the development of the Terms of Reference for this study, my officials met with the local opposition groups to get their views on the focus of the study.  The terms of reference fulfil the central point of the motions that were passed in both Houses and the study will address as much of the issues raised by the opposition groups as is practicable.</p>  <p>  Certain impacts such as environmental and health concerns will not be assessed since the statutory planning process is the appropriate method by which such impacts are assessed and evaluated.  As Minister, I have an overarching duty, unless lawfully challenging a decision, to respect the decisions of lawfully established bodies.</p>  <p>  I also met with a number of Oireachtas members on Tuesday 16 May to update them on the progress in relation to the proposed study and for the members to provide feedback. </p>  <p>  The impact on land and property values and the level of compensation paid in lieu of such impacts was discussed and in response to these concerns I commissioned a study on the levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines in a European context.  The aim of the study is to provide a significant body of independently collated information on comparative practices in a number of jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The results of both studies are expected in Q1 2018.</p></reply>

That procurement process is now at an advanced stage.  &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; submitted by two bidders on 26 September are being evaluated by the NBP specialist team.  The next stage in the procurement process is the receipt of final tenders followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder(s) and contract signature. </p><p>As part of this procurement process, the bidder(s) will be required to submit their strategies, including timescales, for the network build and roll-out.  My Department will engage with the winning bidder(s) to ensure the most efficient deployment as part of the contract.</p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the roll-out by the end of 2018.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">/</font></i>.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie  .</p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website.  Following evaluation by officials from my Department of eir's Q3 update of its rural deployment of high speed broadband I can confirm that eir has met its Q3 target of 101,000 premises passed. </p><p>Prior to the roll-out of the NBP State led intervention, practical initiatives continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Task force, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

There are a wide range of Government Departments, agencies and State bodies that are critical enablers for the development of bioenergy by virtue of their responsibility for areas such as forestry, agriculture, waste, research funding and business development.  The draft Bioenergy Plan sets out the policy areas that must be coordinated to support the development of the bioenergy sector in Ireland.  It identifies a number of supply-side and demand-side measures to support the sustainable development of the sector.     </p>  <p>  Since its publication, a number of the actions set out have progressed significantly. In particular, I would note the increase of the Biofuel Obligation Rate from 6% to 8% in January 2017, the current public consultation on potential future increases in the Biofuel Obligation Rate in January 2019 and January 2020, and the approval by Government last week of a new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the progress made on the actions set out in the plan, the plan itself has not yet been finalised. The publication of the Energy White Paper (Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future) and the National Mitigation Plan have provided an updated policy context. The draft bioenergy Plan is being updated to reflect these and other policy developments. An updated Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and NATURA Impact Statement (NIS) are currently being prepared. I expect the draft plan, SEA and NIS to be published early in the new year for public consultation.</p></reply>

The facilities also received CLAR and RAPID funding from the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  On foot of the concerns raised, my Department engaged in a series of correspondence with the college to seek clarification in this regard and assurances that the grant aided facilities would remain in sporting use.  My Department also inspected the site in June of this year to ensure that the terms and conditions of the original grant were being adhered to.  It should be noted that the concerns raised related to one particular room within the overall sports complex which was previously being used as a gymnasium. </p>  <p>  Following this inspection, the college was asked to provide a report on the usage of the overall facility and to provide evidence of how it was proposed to continue the sporting usage of the room which was the subject of the original complaint.  The college provided this material in October including details of the external users of the facility, the charges being imposed and also included evidence of efforts to secure additional users for the facilities in the future. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department is satisfied that the college is currently in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Sports Capital Programme and the deed of covenant and charge which guarantees that the facilities will stay in sporting use for a period of 15 years from the date of the payment of the last instalment of the grant.  The period of the deed will expire in 2023.  My Department will however, continue to monitor the usage of the facility and engage further with the college if considered necessary.</p>  <p>  In relation to any additional educational resources required by the college, this is of course a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills. </p></reply>

Hence, at high tide, the port has  10.5 metres in the channel (assuming a 4m tide).  This allows the port to accommodate ships with a draft of 9 metres.  The port would routinely handle very substantial vessels.  In the container handling (Lo-Lo/Unitised) operations the current port depths work well for the type of short sea and feeder vessels that are regarded as appropriate for the current market. </p>  <p>  There is some demand for a move to 9.5 metre drafts for a portion of the ports bulk business.  This is something the port is currently examining using its recently developed estuary model.  This model will allow the port to evaluate the potential to gain greater depth, gauge the capital outlay and wider estuary impact and, most importantly, understand the ongoing cost of maintaining a new depth. </p></reply>

The CE sponsoring organisations are the legal employers of CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p><p>My Department is committed to modernising its service delivery and developing systems to support its functions.  Responsibility for CE transferred from F&Aacute;S to my Department in January 2012 and continued to be delivered on a legacy IT platform.  Recently, the CE Programme has been integrated onto my Department&rsquo;s IT infrastructure.  As part of this implementation, a new digital service - Welfare Partners - was developed for organisations who engage with the Department, with a specific focus on providing an online service to CE sponsors and other business partners.</p><p>My Department undertook nationwide consultation workshops with key CE scheme sponsors and supervisors during May and early June.  As part of these consultations, sponsors were informed that my Department would be implementing a new IT platform/Welfare partners, on a phased basis.  All sponsors and supervisors were invited to attend specific information sessions, held nationwide, on how to use the Welfare Partners platform.  A dedicated helpdesk was established to provide assistance to sponsor groups with getting started on Welfare Partners.  Additional resources have recently been allocated to this helpdesk to assist sponsors and supervisors with any access issues they may have.  In addition, sponsors and supervisors have been provided with a Welfare Partners User Manual and further guidance, including a FAQ section, is available on<i>www.welfare.ie.</i>Each scheme also has a dedicated local DEASP Officer who is available to help with any further queries.  </p><p>The sponsor is responsible, through the supervisor, to ensure that the developmental needs of each CE participant on the scheme are catered for.  It is the responsibility of the supervisor to ensure that a profile of each participant&rsquo;s needs is drawn up through one-to-one consultations, and that this profile is reflected in the Individual Learner Plan (ILP), which must be approved by the Department. Each scheme must designate a member of the Project Management Committee to fulfil the role of the participant development officer.  This officer must give full support to the supervisor in the identification, preparation, procurement and delivery of all relevant training, as outlined in the ILP.  It is the individual sponsor&rsquo;s responsibility to meet their contractual obligations and to manage and direct their staff.</p><p>Briefings are provided to sponsors, by Departmental staff, as and when required, to assist them in the management and delivery of the CE scheme, specifically in relation to participant development and scheme governance.</p><p>The IT enhancements outlined above will have a positive impact for CE sponsors as it will ease the administrative burden and improve operational processing.  Customer service is at the centre of my Department&rsquo;s strategies and business and we will continue to develop and extend the range of online services in line with the service delivery modernisation programme.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The changes saw the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, reduced from 25 to 21 years.  It is now also easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 has been disregarded.  While participants aged between 21 and 55 years are entitled to one year on the programme, this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment.  All CE participants aged 55 and over will be able to avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE.  There will be an overall limit of 6 years from 2007 (or 7 years if on a disability payment).</p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the value of these schemes, both in terms of work experience and training they provide to assist long-term unemployed people to return to employment, and also the benefit of these schemes to communities across Ireland supporting community services in childcare, health and social care, and local facilities.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the CE Report to the Deputy for her consideration.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The rate bands in place between 2000 and 2012 were more generous than those in place before and after that period, and were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time. </p>  <p>  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension were maintained.  Instead of reducing those payments, which many vulnerable pensioners were solely reliant upon, the rates paid to new pensioners who both have additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, for a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions, the new rate of payment introduced in 2012 was still higher than the maximum rate that was in place at the start of 2006.  Also, it should be noted that in all European countries and beyond, pension reforms have been introduced to make them more sustainable, and these will generally result in people having different payments depending upon when they reach pension age.  The only way to avoid this would be to introduce the reforms for existing pensioners, and decrease the incomes pensioners have become dependent upon.</p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EU countries.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year. </p>  <p>  The Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the ratebands not been amended in 2012.  As soon as the report is finished I intend to bring it to a cabinet committee and subsequently to Government for consideration early in the New Year.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. </p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is the second successive year the rate has reduced &ndash; representing a 9.7 percentage point reduction on the 2013 rate of 32.3%.  The Irish rate compares to the EU average of 17.1% in 2015 - see Table 1 attached.</p><p>It is important to note that the full impact of the economic recovery to date is not reflected in these figures, which relate to 2015.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% now.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall. </p><p>With these improvements, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  This includes a package of measures to support lone parents, encouraging them into the workplace and into education and helping to reduce their childcare costs.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have benefited from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  Budget 2018 introduced a further &euro;5 per week increase along with an increase of &euro;2 per week per child for qualified child dependents.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance was made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the academic year starting in September 2017.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment increased by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  This was increased to &euro;130 per week in Budget 2018 (an additional &euro;20 per week).</p><p>The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a further reduction in severe material deprivation in the period since 2015.

As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2016 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 24.1 weeks in 2016 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 17.6 weeks in 2016.  </p><p>I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in processing times in 2017 with oral hearings taking, on average, 26.2 weeks and summary decisions taking 19.7 weeks to finalise.  A number of factors have contributed to the increase including the retirement of six experienced Appeals Officers during the first half of 2017.  However, she is hopeful that processing times will improve as a number of newly appointed Officers gain experience in their roles.</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised thatspecific actions taken to reduce processing times include: liaising with HR to ensure that vacancies are filled quickly; ensuring that training is given to new Appeals Officers as early as possible; working with the Department to reduce time in submitting appeal files; and a restructuring of the mechanism for recording appeal decisions.</p><p>It is open to an appellant to claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal if their means are insufficient to meet their needs. </p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that processing times are a priority. However, the drive for efficiency must be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Scheme 01 January 2017- 30 November 2017</b><table><tr><th></th><th><div>Average processing times (weeks)<br /><br />Summary Decisions</div></th><th><div>Average processing <br /><br />times (weeks)<br /><br />Oral Hearings</div></th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td><div>13.4</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Blind Person&rsquo;s Pension </td><td><div>20.2</div></td><td><div>24.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td><div>21.5</div></td><td><div>23.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td><div>16.9</div></td><td><div>21.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td><div>22.7</div></td><td><div>32.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td><div>17.4</div></td><td><div>24.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td><div>28.1</div></td><td><div>30.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td><td><div>34.8</div></td><td><div>34.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance</td><td><div>26.5</div></td><td><div>33.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wifes Benefit</td><td><div>13.1</div></td><td><div>27.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td><div>20.7</div></td><td><div>25.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td><div>15.1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td><div>21.7</div></td><td><div>32.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td><div>16.6</div></td><td><div>23.6</div></td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td><div>20.6</div></td><td><div>24.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td><div>18.8</div></td><td><div>20.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit</td><td><div>19.4</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td><div>24.0</div></td><td><div>34.9</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td><div>31.9</div></td><td><div>46.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)</td><td><div>25.9</div></td><td><div>35.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td><div>81.1</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td><div>19.8</div></td><td><div>26.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td><div>24.6</div></td><td><div>28.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>OIB-Medical Care</td><td><div>-</div></td><td><div>27.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td><div>54.2</div></td><td><div>37.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td><div>24.4</div></td><td><div>26.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Con)</td><td><div>16.0</div></td><td><div>23.4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td><div>19.4</div></td><td><div>26.8</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td><div>17.7</div></td><td><div>25.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>BTW Family Dividend</td><td><div>19.7</div></td><td><div>27.5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional</td><td><div>23.2</div></td><td><div>23.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Recoverable Benefits &amp;amp; Assistance</td><td><div>27.4</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td><div>20.3</div></td><td><div>24.0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant *</td><td><div>17.8</div></td><td><div>25.7</div></td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefit</td><td><div>14.0</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td><div>43.3</div></td><td><div>91.3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance</td><td><div>16.6</div></td><td><div>25.2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td><div>22.0</div></td><td><div>34.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td><div>20.6</div></td><td><div>24.1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant</td><td><div>19.5</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td><div>19.7</div></td><td><div>26.2</div></td></tr></table></p><p>* Previously called Respite Care Grant</p></reply>

This is an improvement on 2014 where the rates were 8.4% and 8.9% respectively.</p><p>However, the full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these figures, which relate to 2015.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.4% in mid-2015 to 6.1% now.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has also continued to fall.  Notwithstanding this, Budget 2018 introduced increases in a range of supports including &euro;5 per week increases in the maximum weekly rate for working-age people and young jobseekers and for pensioners, with proportionate increases for adult dependents and an increase of &euro;2 per child per week for qualified child dependents.

The at-risk-of-poverty rate was 34.8% with the basic deprivation rate at 53.2%.</p><p>Neither Eurostat nor the OECD reports on consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation measures based on principal economic status.  However, in the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), disability is based on the concept of global activity limitation.  This is defined as a &ldquo;limitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six months&rdquo; but it does not differentiate between those in employment and those not in employment.  The latest EU-SILC data available shows that the severe material deprivation rate for people (aged 16 years and over) who are limited in their normal activities due to a health problem was 14.9% in Ireland in 2015, as compared to the EU average of 11.3%.  </p><p>With regard to the national figures, given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2017 and the measures introduced in Budgets 2016, 2017 and 2018, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. </p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p><p>My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority, with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p><p>In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.  Planning authorities must then make their own decisions, based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p><p>I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments.  However, the matter is being kept under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department who lead on renewable energy policy - in the context of the Government's White Paper on Energy Policy, published in December 2015, the development of a Renewable Electricity Policy and Development Framework, as well as the finalisation of a new support scheme for renewable electricity by that Department, expected in 2018.</p><p>In relation to planning statistics, these are compiled by each planning authority on an annual basis for collation and publication on my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: .</p><p>The statistics collected relate to the total numbers of:</p><p>- Invalid applications received,</p><p>- Applications received for outline permission and full permission,</p><p>- Decisions to grant/refuse permission,</p><p>- Decisions issued within the statutory eight-week period,</p><p>- Decisions deferred, and</p><p>- Percentages for grants/refusals, decisions made within eight weeks and decisions deferred.</p><p>The statistics collected relate to the total number of applications and decisions for all developments that require planning permission, broken down by year and planning authority but are not broken down by development type. </p><p>The specific information requested in relation to the number of planning applications received, refused and granted for a particular development type is not collated or available within my Department's statistics. </p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area.  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates.  The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).  Guidance has been provided to local authorities and elected members in that regard. </p>  <p>  My Department has collated information regarding the decisions by local authorities in relation to refund rates from 2015 to 2017.  For 2015, four local authorities chose to amend their refund rate.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council reduced its rate from 100% to 75%.  Galway City and Louth County Councils reduced their rates from 100% to 50%.  Limerick City and County adopted a refund rate of 25%.  All other local authorities chose to retain the existing 2014 refund rate for 2015.  This included Dublin City and Cork City which both retained the pre-existing 50% refund rates in their local authority areas.</p>  <p>  For 2016, all local authorities continued with the same refund rate adopted in 2015, except Waterford City and County Council, which reduced its refund rate from 100% to 70%.</p>  <p>  For 2017, five local authorities chose to amend the refund rate they had for 2016.  Dublin City Council reduced from 50% to 45%, Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council reduced from 75% to 50%, Fingal County Council reduced from 100% to 75%, Limerick City and County Council reduced from 25% to 10% and Waterford City and County Council reduced from 70% to 55%.</p></reply>
