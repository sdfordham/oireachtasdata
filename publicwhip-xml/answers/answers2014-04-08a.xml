    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA00500"><p>At the outset, I must confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities and, as such, it is a commercial decision for each lender to decide what interest rates they charge customers in relation to standard variable mortgages.</p><p>  Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability.  This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution s overall funding arrangements. </p><p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  The Central Bank has, however, no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  As I stated in a previous Parliamentary Question today, the Deputy Governor mentioned that, within its existing powers, and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p><p>  I appreciate that an increase in interest rates which leads to higher the standard variable mortgage interest rates would have a negative impact on the mortgage consumers but on the positive side there would be an increase on deposit rates for consumers also.</p><p>  At the European Central Bank's press conference on 3 April 2014, President of the ECB, Mr Mario Draghi confirmed that key ECB interest rates would remain unchanged at 0.25%. The ECB stated that incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with its precious assessment. However, the ECB also expects that there will be a prolonged period of low inflation. The ECB is committed to doing anything that will keep this period of low inflation from dragging on too long. Therefore key ECB interest rates are expected to remain low for some time yet.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA00800"><p>European Finance Ministers met recently in Athens as part of the Greek Presidency.  The Eurogroup (a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the 18 Eurozone countries) met first on the morning of 1st April chaired by the President of the Eurogroup and Dutch Finance Minister, Mr Jeroen Dijsselbloem.  The second meeting was an Informal Ecofin meeting of the 28 members of the EU represented by Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  This meeting took place on the afternoon of the 1st of April and the following day, 2nd April.   Ireland was represented by Minister of State, Brian Hayes TD and Governor Patrick Honohan. </p><p>  The President of the Eurogroup speaks on behalf of the Eurogroup and, as is normal, held a press conference after the meeting.  His remarks are available on the Eurozone press website.  In summary, the Eurogroup meeting discussed the situation in Greece and in Portugal and it was updated on the state of play in the Ukraine. In addition, the draft budgetary plan of Luxembourg and an update on Banking Union were also covered. The main decision taken at the meeting was on Greece.  The fourth review mission under the second macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece has been concluded. This now allows for approval of the next agreed tranche of aid of EUR 8.3 billion which is to be released in three tranches in the coming months.  A statement by the Eurogroup on Greece was issued after the meeting.   </p><p>  Regarding the Ecofin as the meeting was an informal gathering no decisions were taken. The primary purpose of an informal meeting is to allow Ministers to exchange views on a variety of topics and challenges affecting the EU.  A number of guests, for example Central Bank Governors and European institutions, are also invited to participate.  A statement, summarising the discussions, was released by the Greek Presidency post the meeting and is available on their website.</p><p>  On the key question of Europe's social problems and the present economic situation a research and policy paper was presented by the Brussels based economic organisation, Bruegel, on the link between economic growth and poverty and unemployment.  This gave rise to a debate on how to ameliorate the plight of directly affected EU citizens such as the long term unemployed.</p><p>  There was also a discussion on the economic outlook, growth prospects and financial stability in the EU.  The general consensus was that the economic situation was improving but difficult decisions still needed to be made if sustainable growth was to be achieved.</p><p>  The meeting also discussed the key question of how to improve access to long term financing of the economy and a report by the High Level Experts Group on SME and Infrastructure Financing.  This High Level Group is co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance who made a joint presentation to the Informal Ecofin on this issue.  This is a very important initiative, given that the SME sector is part of the life blood of an economy, and indeed this matter had its genesis under our EU Presidency term.</p><p>  The Ministers endorsed the key messages that the EU would take to the IMF/World Bank Spring meetings and the G20 Finance Ministers meeting on 10/11 April in Washington.  These cover a variety of areas from the economic outlook to financial regulation to specific IMF issues. </p><p>  Finally, the meeting had discussions and presentations on a number of banking related matters.  These ranged from various banking structural measures, arising from the Commission's recent proposals for a Regulation on possible reform options, as well as receiving an update on the implementation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism which is due to come into effect towards the end of 2014 and an update on the overall situation on Banking Union and the Single Resolution Mechanism. </p><p>  Overall, these were very productive meetings with key issues being discussed, with the informal nature of the proceedings allowing Ministers and Central Bank Governors to exchange views on critical issues.</p><p>  In addition, a meeting also took place of the Joint Ecofin/ Facility Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership Ministerial Meetings co-chaired by the Ecofin President and the EIB President to discuss matters of growth and job creation, especially for young people, and a new EIB strategy for the Mediterranean region.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.14.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA01000"><p><i>11.</i> To ask the Minister for Finance his views on figures from the Central Bank of Ireland which show that the total lending to Irish households fell back to &euro;106 billion in February, the lowest level since July 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[16061/14]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA01100"><p>Total household 'on balance sheet' outstanding loan amounts fell to &euro;106 billion in February 2014, comprising 78 per cent loans for house purchase with the remainder relating to consumer credit and other loans.</p><p>  Aggregate household indebtedness has been declining in Ireland over the last number of years, both in nominal terms and as a share of household income. To a certain extent this is a necessary process given the high and ultimately unsustainable levels of lending to households in the years to 2008. Households are also reducing their indebtedness in response to the large reduction in the value of their assets, mainly due to the considerable decline in the value of housing wealth in the years to 2013.</p><p>  Consumption by households in Ireland fell by 7 per cent between 2008 and 2013 according to the CSO. This was due to a number of factors, both the substantial decline in employment over the period but the reduction in lending to households is likely to have played a part. Over the medium term high levels of household indebtedness and the need to repair household balance sheets are likely to mean that the savings rate will remain relatively high, with implications for household consumption.   </p><p>  Nonetheless, recent developments in the domestic economy have been positive of late. Employment grew by 3.3 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of last year. Unemployment has fallen by three percentage points over the last three years. The recent Exchequer statement showed positive tax revenue growth in line with these positive developments in the labour market. Retail sales have been strong in the first months of the year, and were up 5.0% year-on-year in February. Turning to the outlook, my Department forecast 1.8 % private consumption growth this year at Budget time. My Department will set out a revised set of forecasts as part of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) later this month. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA01300"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that almost 41 million cigarettes and over 4,200 kilograms of tobacco were seized by them in 2013 as a result of their extensive programme of action against the illicit tobacco trade.</p><p>  The quantity of cigarettes seized in 2013 was lower than in 2012 and 2011, when seizures amounted to 95.6 million and 109.1 million respectively. It must, be borne in mind, however, that the quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures, and the level of seizures in 2013 must be viewed against the background of a number of very large seizures in the preceding years. I understand also that the Revenue Commissioners participate actively in multilateral controlled deliveries of smuggled cigarettes and tobacco, resulting in the seizure of illicit products in other jurisdictions before they reach Ireland.</p><p>  I am advised also that the quantity of cigarettes seized has declined in most EU Member States over the last number of years and that this reflects, in considerable part, a changed practice adopted by the organised crime gangs that are responsible for a large element of the illicit trade. There has been a movement from large consignments in containers to smaller consignments in deeper concealment within groupage loads, and these can be more difficult to detect. The Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts in other EU Member States are working together to combat this form of smuggling and to ensure that the disruptive effect of seizures on the illicit trade is maximised.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners arrange for annual estimations of the extent of the illicit cigarette market, through surveys of smokers undertaken for them and the Health Services Executive. The survey for 2012 found that 13% of the cigarettes consumed in Ireland were illicit. The comparable figure for 2011 was 14%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product.</p><p>  I am aware that some other surveys indicate a higher level of illicit tobacco consumption. However, I do not accept the validity of these other surveys, as they are not representative of the entire smoking population and do not take into account legal personal imports from other jurisdictions.  </p><p>  The action to combat the illicit trade will continue to be a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners and they will continue to operate an extensive range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the sale or supply of illicit products, with a view both to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.</p><p>  In relation to staff numbers, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that  they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against the illicit trade in tobacco products. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009. Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,757. Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, enforcement work generally, and action against the illicit tobacco trade specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA01500"><p>The experience of the financial crisis has discredited 'light touch' regulation. The response of the Government to the regulatory failures identified in the reports by Governor Patrick Honohan, Messrs. Regling and Watson and the Nyberg Commission has been to put in place a system of robust regulation, with assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 created a single fully-integrated Central Bank of Ireland, with a more complete remit over prudential regulation and financial stability issues. </p><p>  The 2010 Act also increased the transparency and accountability of the Central Bank.  For example, the Central Bank will soon publish its annual performance statement, which will laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Act includes a requirement for the Governor and the Deputy Governors to appear before an Oireachtas Committees -- if requested -- to provide information regarding the annual regulatory performance statement.  The Central Bank is also scheduled to undergo an International Peer Review of its regulatory performance later this year.</p><p>  The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides the necessary mechanisms to enable the Central Bank to intervene where a credit institution gets into serious difficulty and is in danger of becoming destabilised or otherwise failing. </p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 further strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely regulatory interventions.</p><p>  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank, with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels. </p><p>  I am satisfied that these reforms, in addition to the many reforms being introduced at European level, have brought our regulatory system into line with international best practice. </p></reply>

The management of litigation is a matter for the Board of NAMA.  </p><p>  I have been advised by the Special Liquidators of IBRC that the bank identified overcharging issues in the bank in June 2010. A steering committee was established to oversee a forensic investigation into the circumstances surrounding this overcharging issue and to ensure that affected customers were fully refunded the overcharge amount together with appropriate compensation. Project teams within IBRC calculated the amount of interest overcharge and compensation for every affected customer and refunds plus compensation cheques were made available to affected customers by the end of Q1, 2012. The Special Liquidators have further advised that in the Republic of Ireland any claims made in relation to the potential overcharging of interest would likely rank as unsecured creditors in the liquidation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800052#WRA01900"><p>I would like to highlight that the OECD paper, to which the Deputy refers, is a consultation document, which was published to generate discussion and to seek the views of interested parties. The consultation period is open until the middle of this month. I would like to stress that the OECD working group which is examining this issue has still not made any decisions on the likely final outcome of their analysis. The paper  is very clear in that regard and states, on page 62, "Although the Task Force has initially discussed the proposals, it has not yet reached any conclusions about any of these proposals, which are still in the process of being developed". The paper also discusses the so-called digital economy and examines whether special tax rules  might be required. It concludes, on page 24, "the digital economy is increasingly becoming the economy itself, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy". The digital economy is not a specific sector of the economy anymore   rather the whole economy is becoming digitalised.  Furthermore the paper addresses the issue of electronic commerce and the long-standing taxation principles which apply. Page 6 of the paper concludes "The Task Force considers that these principles are still relevant today and, supplemented as necessary, can constitute the basis to evaluate options to address the tax challenges of the digital economy".

The Exchequer Statement showed that the Exchequer deficit at end quarter 1 2014 stood at &euro;2,316 million, which represented an improvement of &euro;1,379 million compared to quarter 1 2013.  </p><p>   Budget 2014, forecasted tax revenues of &euro;40,040 million in 2014, and our target for the first quarter of 2014 was &euro;8,975 million. Tax revenues of &euro;9,232 million were collected at the end of the quarter 1, an increase of &euro;415 million or 4.7% on the same period last year and &euro;257 million or 2.9% above profile.  </p><p>    Post publication of the Exchequer Returns, the Central Bank informed my Department of a discrepancy in the Exchequer returns.   The overall level of tax collected is unchanged. For example, in March,  &euro;101 million of revenue was attributed to VAT that should have been attributed to income tax.  The Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank are currently examining the issue and a revised Exchequer statement will issue in due course.</p><p>     While expenditure is primarily a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it is also worth pointing out that at the end of quarter 1 2014, expenditure on public services is within Budget. Total net voted expenditure of &euro;10,264 million was down &euro;631 million or 5.8% in year-on-year terms and &euro;261 million (2.5%) below profile.   </p><p>   As I stated in relation to the end-March Exchequer Statement, performance in the first quarter of 2014 highlights that the Government s plan to restore order to our public finances is working. Tax revenues continue to grow in line with profile and expenditure on public services is within Budget.  </p><p>   Notwithstanding this solid start to 2014, we have to continue to reduce our level of spending and increase the amount of revenue we collect in order to close that gap further and ensure the sustainability of the public finances.   </p><p>   Finally, my Department will produce updated macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts in   the Stability Programme Update to be published later this month.  These will take account of the latest economic and fiscal data and will give updated deficit projection over the forecast horizon. </p></reply>

This would apply in respect of each of the programme funding partners.</p><p>  The impact of early repayment of our IMF loans on our bond yields would need to be carefully considered were such a possibility to arise.

The matter of early repayment of our IMF loans, and thus requesting permission to repay Ireland's IMF loans prior to the maturity dates, does not arise at the moment but we will keep it under review. I should also point out that, as the IMF loans have a shorter average maturity, they will be repaid considerably in advance of the EFSF and EFSM loans for which we negotiated maturity extensions.</p></reply>

I do not intend to speculate on when that process might be concluded.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware Permanent TSB is not alone in seeking such approval. I am also seeking approval from the European Commission for the Restructuring Plan submitted by AIB. While no plan has been approved, Permanent TSB has made significant progress in delivering key elements of the Restructuring Plan submitted over the last year and the business is being managed structurally in the way envisaged in the plan. Permanent TSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investments through the continued delivery of the Restructuring Plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of Permanent TSB.  </p><p>  During 2013 Permanent TSB grew its presence and activity in the retail market in general and in the current account and deposit markets in particular, as well as in mortgages and term lending; and it launched several new products during the year. I am advised that Permanent TSB paid out over &euro;200m in mortgage lending in 2013 and that it had a market share of retail deposits of c 13%.  As a result of the progress made during 2013 Permanent TSB is now a genuine and important competitor in the retail banking market.  </p><p>  Permanent TSB has also made progress in relation to managing its portfolio of mortgages in arrears and has created a dedicated team to deal with those customers and to roll out various solutions to them. I am advised by Permanent TSB that during 2013 it made approximately 18,000 offers of long term sustainable solutions to customers in arrears or having difficulty with their mortgage repayments.</p><p>  The current strategy is for Permanent TSB to be an independent bank, competing within targeted segments of the retail banking market, and I will continue to support the board and management in the delivery of that strategy.   </p></reply>

However, I have also said that although it is my intention to alleviate the burden I can only do so when the public finances allow it. Lest it has escaped anybody's attention, the general government debt at end 2013 is currently estimated to be just over &euro;200 billion and each year where we incur an annual deficit that figure grows. It is imperative that we, at the very least, are able to meet the interest costs on this debt if this is not to spiral ever upwards. Interest payments are the least productive area of government expenditure and what we currently spend on interest could be put to better use elsewhere.</p><p>   Although we have successfully exited the EU/IMF bailout this does not mean that we will ever allow a return to past practices where expenditure grew to unsustainable levels while the tax base was simultaneously hollowed out.</p><p>   The Government remains committed to returning the public finances to sustainability. Under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions. This means that Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.</p><p>  Having said this, it should be acknowledged that Ireland has a progressive taxation system which ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay. The latest data from the OECD's 2013 Taxing Wages report shows that Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. It is in this context that the Government has committed in the Programme for Government not to increase the marginal rate of income tax. </p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment not to change tax credits which at current levels ensure that an estimated 856,000 income earners are excluded from the charge to income tax entirely. The low effective tax rates for low income earners ensure that work pays and is a growth friendly aspect of Ireland's tax system. However against this Ireland has one of the highest top marginal tax rates in the OECD, whilst also having a very low entry point to the application of the top marginal rates. These aspects are less growth friendly due to their negative labour supply incentives. </p><p>  Recent research from my Department has indicated that growth and employment prospects can be enhanced through a careful rebalancing of the tax system away from labour taxation towards greater use of capital and consumption taxes. Research by the OECD and the European Commission would also support such a rebalancing. These insights are useful given the fiscal constraints to which I have already referred.  </p><p>  It is a little early to consider, let alone set out, changes to the tax system in advance of the Budget, which is just over six months away. As is normal, my officials will model and examine potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package.</p></reply>

Following the publication I requested that the three banks in which t he State is a shareholder make total remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%.  The three banks responded with their individual strategies, designed to achieve the required savings, by the due date of 30 April as requested. I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability. I reviewed the plans submitted and in light of the various industrial relations developments during 2013 I was satisfied that the banks' plans would meet my direction.</p><p>  It is worth noting in this context that in their respective 2013 annual results,  AIB reported a 16%  year-on-year decline in costs while ptsb reported a 13% decline in staff costs. Including a one-off pension related gain of c&euro;400m, Bank of Ireland's total costs reduced by 28% year-on-year. Despite this momentum it is imperative that all the banks make every effort to hold down costs in the coming years and particularly staff related costs which form the lion's share of total costs. As the Deputy will be aware I recently signalled that I will not approve of any return to bonus schemes at these banks as this would not be appropriate at this time.</p><p>With respect to the forthcoming shareholder meetings, only Bank of Ireland has issued the documentation for its Annual General Court to be held on April 25th  . My Department will fully peruse all the documentation before deciding the appropriate vote for each of the resolutions and as always, will vote in the best interest of the State and to maximise the return to the taxpayer.  In the case of AIB and PTSB my department has yet to receive notification of the resolutions for their annual general meetings.</p></reply>

There is a specific provision included in those main features, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>  The operational framework of the DRI has been discussed at ministerial level and the aim is to complete this discussion as soon as possible in order to allow the ESM Member States sufficient time to complete any necessary national procedures before the SSM is in place and operational later this year.</p><p>  Finally, both I and my Government colleagues will ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.</p></reply>

This covers statistics for both 2013 and 2014 (to February 2014).</p><p>As indicated in the Revenue Commissioner s statistics, there are about 18,700 properties where deferrals have been claimed and around 28,300 claims for exemptions among the returns processed to date. These equate to about 1.2% and 1.8% of properties returned respectively.  These figures are primarily based on claims submitted by property owners in their LPT returns. </p><p>As the Deputy notes, earlier forecasts predicted that the level of deferrals and exemptions could be substantially higher. These figures were estimated prior to the implementation of LPT. While considerable effort may have been put into initial estimates of possible levels of exemption and deferral, the impact of the actual exemption and deferral provisions could not be accurately determined until the returns process has been completed. </p><p>It should be noted that deferral is a personal choice issue for property owners and some, although they meet the conditions of deferral, may opt to pay the tax if their means allow it.  Consequently, even if the number of potential eligible cases were known in advance with accuracy, it would not have been possible to estimate the number that would actually apply for a deferral.</p><p>Revenue estimates that the compliance rate for 2013 is currently at 93%. It may be the case that some property owners have not claimed an exemption on the misapprehension that they are automatically entitled to one. Indeed, these properties may well account for a significant share of the current non-compliant group.  It is important for property owners to be aware that they must apply for exemption from LPT as it will not be granted automatically and the Revenue Commissioners advise that this has been a key part of their communications message since the introduction of the tax.</p></reply>

Section 149 came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an  application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce a new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not apply to interest rates; it applies to fees, charges  and commissions only. </p><p>As required by the Troika, my Department published a review of the regulation of bank fees and charges; the review is available on the website . </p><p>The review found that:</p><p>- net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers; and</p><p>- net fee and commission are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income.</p><p>The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the repeal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  The report recommends that this issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.  It is my view that the current regulatory regime offers appropriate protection to consumers against unjustified increases in bank fees and commissions. </p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that I have expressed this view to the lenders and my officials are keeping in regular contact with the lenders on this important issue.  </p><p>  Regretfully, however, it must also be accepted that due to the individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable and that in these limited circumstances, it will be in the best interests of both parties to resolve the situation in a fair manner.  </p></reply>

The objective of the review is focused solely on determining whether the banks have enough provisions against their loans and capital. Irish banks have just undergone such an exercise, their second in less than three years, which led to a substantial increase in their loan loss provisions at year end. As I have stated previously, I do not anticipate any capital issues for the Irish banks arising from the Comprehensive Assessment.</p></reply>

It is important though that we establish an environment conducive for banks and alternative credit providers to enter the Irish market and compete. </p><p>  In this regard:</p><p>  - we are working to manage and minimise potential market expectations of future State support for the State owned banks which could act as a deterrent to new market entrants;</p><p>  - we are actively bringing forward new initiatives to promote alternative sources of lending and credit in the Irish marketplace, the most recent example of this being the link with KfW the German State Development Bank;</p><p>  - we are working to establish equality in the assessment of credit risk through the establishment of an industry wide credit register to allow for the appropriate measure of risk in lending, allowing incumbent and new lenders to lend with full visibility of the risk of that lending. The Credit Reporting Act was passed at the end of 2013;</p><p>  - we are working to reduce switching costs to allow customers to move between banks more easily, enhancing competition and forcing banks to work hard to retain their customers on a commercial basis;</p><p>  - we are in regular dialogue with potential market entrants as they evaluate potential opportunities in Ireland and will be supportive of new entrants as they emerge. </p><p>     Another key element to supporting credit in the economy is non-bank financing.  Ireland needs to develop a more diversified financial system with increased direct capital market financing and a greater involvement by institutional investors and alternative sources of finance.  In this regard, the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF), along with third parties, has committed to a number of investments for SMEs, both credit and equity.  These include the SME Equity Fund   Better Capital, the SME Equity Fund   Cardinal Carlyle and the SME Credit Fund   Bluebay.</p></reply>

There is significant engagement with representatives of legitimate business, through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group, which is chaired by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Revenue's tax compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow/hidden economy.  I am informed that Revenue tackles the problem of tax and duty evasion through their range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue's assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.  The Revenue Commissioners are assisted in the process of assessing risks and identifying suitable cases in which to intervene by using their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system.  REAP integrates data from a range of sources, including internal Revenue information and external third party sources and risk rates taxpayers accordingly.  </p><p>  Revenue deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks and activities undertaken and these include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as aspect queries on specific items.</p><p>  For my part, I have it made clear that I am committed to introducing measures that will assist the Revenue Commissioners in their work to combat shadow economy activity, and that I will respond positively where a case is made for further powers or other statutory measures that would strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with such activity. </p><p>  In the specific case of the illicit tobacco trade, I am aware that combating this trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country. Revenue will continue to act against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.</p><p>  I have provided for a number of new measures in recent Finance Acts that are designed to assist the Revenue Commissioners in the work against the illicit tobacco trade. Provisions in the Finance Act 2013 will allow them to deal more effectively with the risk of the illicit manufacture of tobacco products, and include a new offence relating to illicit production of tobacco products, as well as provision for forfeiture of equipment or material used in illicit production. In addition, the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 has made provision for a power of search of baggage and receptacles, where there is reasonable belief that a person is guilty of an offence of dealing illegally in unstamped tobacco products.</p><p>  Action has been taken also against fuel fraud. Following on from initiatives that have strengthened the licensing of fuel traders and brought about enhanced control of the fuels supply chain, the Finance (no. 2) Act 2013 makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel liable for duty where that fuel is used for an illicit purpose. In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom have worked together to identify a more effective marker for marked gas oil, for use in both jurisdictions. The new marker, which was announced on 13 February 2014, will be more resistant to laundering and will, therefore, be a key element of Revenue's overall strategy for dealing with that problem. The new marker will be introduced in consultation with the oil industry and is expected to be in place within 12 to 18 months.</p><p>  I have also introduced specific Finance Bill measures to counteract shadow economy activity and fraudulent practices that undermine the VAT base.  One such provision seeks to deter possible collusion between a supplier and customer for the purpose of taking part in, or facilitating VAT fraud. A second measure provides that credit for VAT on goods and services purchased is disallowed where a business has not, within a six month period, fully or partly paid for them, and repayment of the VAT claimed on those purchases will be required. Thirdly, the Revenue Commissioners will be able to issue notices requiring businesses to provide specific information in circumstances where Revenue has reasonable grounds for believing that the information might assist in identifying shadow economy activity.</p><p>  I should add that legitimate businesses can also assist in combating the shadow economy, by providing information on shadow economy activities to the Revenue Commissioners or other relevant State agencies, and I would encourage them to support the extensive work that is being carried out against illicit activities by doing so.   </p></reply>

Last year the State completed three transactions   the sale of the CoCo and preference share investments in Bank of Ireland, and our investment in Irish Life. These disposals generated total proceeds of &euro;4.45bn.</p><p>  The banks are at different stages in their recovery and this influences the relative attractiveness of each bank to the investor community and their consequent valuation. Bank of Ireland is the most advanced of the banks and this provided us with the opportunities we chose to avail of last year. </p><p>  Following the monetisation of the preference shares in December 2013, our remaining investment in Bank of Ireland comprises our almost 14% equity holding. The market value of this holding, at the current share price of 32c per share, is c.&euro;1.4bn. As I have stated recently, any decision to sell this stake will be a question of price. Officials in my Department continue to monitor market conditions and advise me in this regard. </p><p>  With reference to AIB, I am encouraged by the progress the bank is making. Our first priority is to see the bank return to profitability and address its legacy issues. In time this should enable the State to be in a position to exit part of its investment in the bank should we wish to do so. As I have said recently, the Government might look to &quot;test the market&quot; before the next election in order to establish a valuation for the bank.</p><p>  The potential involvement of a strategic or capital market based investor for Permanent tsb (&quot;PTSB&quot;) will be considered at an appropriate time having regard to the best interests of the State. My officials and PTSB are in regular contact regarding matters such as capital structure and will consider all potential strategies in this regard.</p><p>  In the meantime PTSB continues to work to enhance the value of our investment through the continued delivery of the restructuring plan, which will, if delivered, provide the State with more optionality regarding the future structure of PTSB. Key activities include a return to meaningful lending and material progress in resolving arrears in mortgages and commercial real estate.</p></reply>

Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. </p><p>In June 2013 the Central Bank, in consultation with the European Central Bank, set quarterly institution-specific performance targets for covered banks to move distressed SME borrowers, including those who are overburdened with debt due to property assets, onto longer-term forbearance solutions.  The targets set reflect the banks' capacity, processes and systems.  The Central Bank has informed the officials in my Department that the banks have reported that they have met their required targets to date.  This perspective has been reaffirmed by both the IMF and the European Commission who report that the<b></b>workout of SME arrears is progressing and that imposed targets are being met.  <b></b></p><p>Recently published results from the covered Irish banks indicate that both banks are well advanced in restructuring their SME loan books.  Bank of Ireland's most recent published results indicate that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases.  Similarly the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year. </p><p>The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue in 2014. Additionally, the enactment of legislation to allow small companies (as defined by the Companies Acts) to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership and the on going work of the Credit Review Office, which has been given an expanded remit, are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in adressing their debt situation. I should stress that the credit review process remains available to any SMEs whose credit has been reduced or withdrawn by AIB or Bank of Ireland as well as when credit is refused by them. I would strongly advise any SME whose credit is reduced or withdrawn to avail of the services of the Credit Review Office.</p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that a meeting has taken place between Professor Morgan Kelly and representatives of the Central Bank, but I am not privy to the details of any such meetings conducted by the Central Bank.</p><p>The remarks by the UCD academic Professor Morgan Kelly, relate to the forthcoming stress testing by the ECB and in this context the Governor of the Central Bank indicated recently that the purpose of the forthcoming ECB stress tests on 128 European banks, which includes Irish banks, was to remove market and government doubts about the ability of banks to absorb losses with their own shareholders funds.  It is important to highlight that the ECB Comprehensive Assessment will not get into loan restructuring. The objective of the review is focused solely on determining whether the banks have enough provisions against their loans and capital. Irish banks have just undergone such an exercise, their second in less than three years, which led to a substantial increase in their loan loss provisions at year end. As I have stated previously, I do not anticipate any capital issues for the Irish banks arising from the Comprehensive Assessment.</p></reply>

RBS is currently reviewing the operations of Ulster Bank in Ireland with a view to creating a sustainable business model, and on 27 February 2014, RBS re-iterated its commitment to the Irish market. It is good news that the bank has committed so firmly to the Irish market. </p><p>  From a domestic banking perspective, the continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market will be important in fostering competition for banking services. It is vital that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit - all of which will become increasingly important as the economy recovers. Officials in the Department of Finance have been in contact with both RBS and Ulster Bank officials and this will continue as the bank finalises its plans for the future.</p><p>  Similarly my officials regularly review the performance of Permanent TSB particularly with regard to the resolution of mortgage arrears and other non-performing loans and the re-establishment of the bank as a competitive presence in the Irish domestic banking market. In these, and many other areas, the management team of Permanent TSB has made considerable progress and while the indentifiable legacy issues continue to impact on the financial performance they are being pro-actively managed.  </p><p>     Now that the Programme of Support is over, it has been succeeded by the Government's Medium Term Economic Strategy. One of the key planks of the MTES is making sufficient credit available and in this regard I am examining a whole series of options for both bank credit and non-bank credit. </p><p>     In addition to the many initiatives relating to non-bank credit, the Deputy will be aware that I would like to see more competition in the domestic banking system to provide the lending required for our growing economy.  One option would be to continue to build up Permanent TSB.  I would also welcome the participation of foreign banks in Ireland, possibly by way of  partnership with some of our domestic banks.     </p><p>     I have not yet formed a view on the structure of a banking system which would support the needs of the Irish economy, and this will require further evaluation over the coming months and years, as the State and the banks currently operating in Ireland normalise and put the legacy banking issues, which were the priority when I came into office, behind them.  </p></reply>

Ongoing conflict, human rights violations and gender-based violence in the east of the country continue to displace hundreds of thousands of people internally and across borders into neighbouring countries.  It is vital to counter and deal with all destabilising forces in the region, that regional Governments, including the Government of Rwanda, cooperate with the United Nations on this and play a positive role in searching for peace and stability.  Central to this is the process of reconciliation, justice for the perpetrators of human rights abuses and peace building, so that the myriad development needs of the people in eastern DRC can be met.  </p><p>  The EU pursues a comprehensive approach to the DRC and Great Lakes region encompassing political, security, development and humanitarian response.  The main focus of the EU's political engagement is supporting the implementation of the Framework Agreement for Peace, Security and Cooperation in the Great Lakes Region which was signed in Addis Ababa on 24 February 2013.  The signatories of the Framework Agreement are the DRC and its 10 neighbours, including Rwanda.      </p><p>  Former President Mary Robinson was appointed on 18 March 2013 as the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for the Great Lakes region of Africa and her role is to coordinate and assess the implementation of national and regional commitments under the Framework Agreement.  Ireland is committed to supporting this work and in December 2013, Ireland contributed &euro;300,000 to the UN Trust Fund in support of the Office of the Special Envoy.  We are also actively considering support for the Women&rsquo;s Platform for the peace process in the Great Lakes Region which is under the guidance of Special Envoy Robinson. </p><p>  Since 2009, Ireland has provided &euro;44.6 million in response to the crisis in the DRC.  In 2013 alone, Ireland provided over &euro;5.5 million in humanitarian funding to the DRC - &euro;3.8 million was provided to the Common Humanitarian Fund for the DRC, while the remaining &euro;1.8 million was allocated to NGO partners. </p></reply>

Such evidence establishes the person's new name as his/her legal name.</p><p>  The required evidence to show the usage of a new name was not provided with the initial application.  Accordingly, the Department wrote to him, initially to request the evidence of the use of the name, and, when this could not be provided, to refuse a passport to him in his new name. </p><p>  This decision was subsequently appealed under the Act by the applicant to the Passport Appeals Officer.  The appeals process is independent to the operation of the Passport Service.  However, I understand the matter is being considered by the Passport Appeals Officer (PAO) and the Department has submitted observations to the PAO on this case. </p><p>  Pending the findings of the independent appeals process there are a two options open to the applicant which could secure his passport:</p><p>  (i) re-apply for a passport in his new name with supporting evidence showing the usage of his new name; or</p><p>  (ii) apply for a passport in the name in his previous passport. </p></reply>

As part of the review, on 18<sup>th</sup>March, I launched a public consultation.  The consultation paper is available on my Department's website.  I would encourage as many individuals and groups as possible who have an interest in the area to submit contributions, in order that we can draw on the public&rsquo;s views, knowledge and experience in considering future policy.</p><p>Ireland's embassies and consulates around the world have circulated the consultation document to Irish communities in their countries and areas of accreditation, to help broaden the base of submissions. </p><p>As indicated in the consultation paper, among the issues that will be considered in the review are:</p><p>- Identifying the trends in the ongoing development of the Diaspora</p><p>- Understanding the needs of different emigrant and Diaspora communities overseas and how to respond to these.  These include new emigrants, the undocumented in the US and ageing emigrant communities.</p><p>- The role of the Diaspora in social and economic development in Ireland.</p><p>- The continued importance and role of the Diaspora for peace on this island.</p><p>- The status, rights and entitlements of emigrants and returning emigrants.</p><p>- How the Government can best connect with the Irish abroad. </p><p>Of course my Department is open to receiving views on all aspects of the Government's engagement and relationship with the Diaspora, beyond what is covered in this list. </p><p>It is intended that this review will be complementary to the wider Review of Foreign Policy and External Relations being conducted by my Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

The number and level of staff, and the time spent on individual replies, depends on the complexity and urgency of the issues raised, the ease of access to the required information, and the degree of cross-Divisional coordination required in preparing the reply.  The cost of answering Parliamentary Questions can vary considerably, therefore, and it would be extremely difficult to identify the administrative costs associated with the processing of individual Questions.  My Department introduced an electronic system to expedite the processing of Parliamentary Questions in 2013.

The purpose of the mission was to assess developments in the country, and examine how Irish Aid could develop an assistance programme for Myanmar/Burma.  The visit encompassed a wide range of meetings with political, business, diplomatic and civil society contacts.  The range of meetings allowed a broad assessment of developments in the country, and &ndash; in addition to identifying key elements of a possible aid programme &ndash; the opportunity to identify potential avenues to improve trade, investment and other links between Ireland and Myanmar/Burma.</p><p>  The Delegation visited Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw and Kachin, and met three Ministers, the National League for Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Heads of Mission and development specialists from EU and other countries, representatives of multi-lateral organisations, high-level business contacts, and a wide range of civil society organisations.    </p><p>  On foot of the scoping visit &ndash; as well as several visits by Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Myanmar (based in Hanoi), and suggestions made to me by Aung San Suu Kyi during meetings with her last year including at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in October 2013 &ndash; I agreed funding of &euro;500,000 for a bilateral development assistance programme in Myanmar/Burma in 2013.  This bilateral programme of support, which will be managed from the Embassy in Hanoi, is aligned with Ireland's new policy for development 'One World &ndash; One future' and with the Department&rsquo;s current country strategy in Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. </p><p>  The programme itself is designed to maximise our interventions and resources and will support improved livelihoods for poor rural people; the development of the agriculture sector; the peace process - by developing mine risk education and awareness of unexploded ordnance among local civil society groups; and the development of responsible business practice and transparency.  The same level of funding has also been agreed for 2014.  I have tasked officials to undertake further work on how Ireland can assist in the area of trade promotion, capacity building and education scholarships with a view to developing a more strategic bilateral programme from 2014.</p><p>  This programme is in addition to Irish Aid support to civil society organisations for development and humanitarian interventions in Myanmar/Burma which totalled just over &euro;2.9 million between 2011 and 2013.  This includes &euro;1.325 million provided to Tr&oacute;caire in 2013 for development interventions focused on governance, human rights and gender equality, and humanitarian projects, including in Kachin and Shan states.  Irish Aid also provided USD 200,000 for the provision of AIDS treatment and a continuum of care to People Living with HIV in Myanmar in 2009-2011 through UNAIDS and implemented by the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, Ratana Metta (a local NGO) and the World Food Programme.</p><p>  I am considering additional support also for humanitarian responses in Myanmar/Burma in 2014 through Irish Aid's humanitarian programme.  A humanitarian visit and assessment by Ireland, as part of a wider UNHCR visit in the latter part of 2013, found that the on-going humanitarian emergency in Rakhine state presents the most pressing humanitarian concern for Myanmar/Burma, its neighbours and its international partners. </p><p>  Since 2007, over &euro;7m in total has been provided by the Irish Aid Programme to Myanmar/Burma through NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development and emergency and recovery responses.</p></reply>

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted. </p><p>  Also, where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority, and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property. Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.</p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers I can confirm that there is no provision in the legislation to provide for an exemption from LPT in the circumstances outlined.  However, as I recently advised the House in my reply to Question 15021/14, my officials are currently examining the operation of Local Property Tax (LPT) reliefs in respect of disabled and/or incapacitated people and will make recommendations to me on the issue shortly.</p><p>  Finally, Revenue has advised me that a member of LPT Branch will make contact with the person in question in the coming days to discuss various issues that he has raised in correspondence. </p></reply>

Purchases by a qualifying coach operator by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue are not subject to a minimum purchase requirement and allow the coach operator concerned to avoid fuel storage while claiming under the scheme, thereby alleviating the security risks identified.    </p><p>  Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.  I understand that the Federation of Transport Operators has made representations to Revenue along the lines proposed by the Deputies and Revenue will communicate directly with the Federation on these matters shortly.    </p></reply>

In this context, the greyhound industry involves a variety of supplies of goods and services that come within the scope of VAT.  In the first instance, betting on greyhound racing is generally exempt from VAT.</p><p>  With regard to greyhound food, the supply of dog food is liable to VAT at the standard VAT rate of 23%.  However, a concession was introduced in Finance Act 1995, to provide for a reduced VAT rate to apply to the supply of greyhound feeding stuff &quot;which is packaged, advertised or held out for sale solely as greyhound feeding and which is supplied in units of not less than 10 kilograms&quot;.  The VAT rate applying in this case is 13.5%.  This reduction was introduced to specifically aid the Irish greyhound breeding industry as food for dogs and other domestic pets applies at the 23% standard rated.</p><p>  The supply of the service of training of greyhounds is subject to VAT at the 23% standard rate.</p><p>  The supply of live greyhounds is currently subject to VAT at the super reduced VAT rate of 4.8%. However, the European Court of Justice in Case C-108/11 judged that Ireland has been incorrect in applying the 4.8% rate to the supply of greyhounds and certain horses, and to the hire of horses.  As a consequence of this judgement provision was made in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 to apply the 9% reduced VAT rate to supplies of greyhounds.  However, the change in VAT rate has not yet been introduced. The Revenue Commissioners are currently in the process of finalising the administrative procedures around the legislative change and it is anticipated that the new rate will take effect in the next few months.</p><p>  With regard to the supply of greyhound insemination services, under current arrangements, the majority of  greyhound insemination services are subject to the 13.5% reduced VAT rate, while the 4.8% super reduced rate applies specifically to 'no litter, no fee' insemination services.  The judgement of the European Court of Justice also ruled that the 4.8% rate should not be applied to these services.  In this regard, the Finance (No. 2) Act changes also include provision for the application of the 13.5% VAT rate to the supply of all insemination services - whether by artificial or natural means, or under a 'no litter, no fee' arrangement. </p><p>  The increase in the VAT rate to 9% for supplies of greyhounds and to 13.5% for 'no litter, no fee' insemination services represents the lowest possible VAT rates allowable under EU VAT law and Ireland's VAT rate structure for these particular goods and services.</p></reply>

These concessions are not subject to a Section 149 notification i.e. an institution may choose to apply such internal account structures at its own discretion and so the Central Bank has no power in this area to approve or reject such revisions. </p><p>The Central Bank does not publish data on the maximum charges approved for individual credit institutions under Section 149. </p><p>A Financial Product Comparison tool is available on the National Consumer Agency's website, , which consumers may consult to compare current fees imposed by credit institutions for various financial services products. Individuals may also consult information leaflets available in bank branches. </p><p>All banks providing current accounts in Ireland are subject to the Central Bank's Current Account Switching Code, which is designed to make the process of switching current accounts easier and quicker and to offer protection and support for consumers when switching bank account.

Under the provisions of Section 256(2)(a) and Section 257(1)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 the rate of DIRT that is applicable to a payment or crediting of deposit interest is the rate in operation on the date the relevant deposit interest is paid or credited to the account. This means that when a change of rate occurs there is no apportionment of the interest chargeable to tax between the amounts accrued before and after the date of the rate change. The new rate is applied to all of the interest paid or credited on or after the date of the rate change.</p><p>   In many instances the depositor may not become entitled to the interest concerned until the date of payment or crediting. Applying different rates of DIRT to interest paid or credited, based on an apportionment of the interest to different periods, would add significant complexity to the operation of DIRT, being a retention tax deducted at source. It would also be contrary to the general principle whereby a taxpayer only becomes liable to tax on interest when he or she receives that interest by payment of crediting. </p></reply>

The objective of the ESM's DRI will be to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States in line with Article 3 of the ESM Treaty, and to help remove the risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign by allowing the recapitalisation of institutions directly.</p><p>There is a specific provision included in the main features of the DRI, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. </p><p>The operational framework of the DRI has been discussed at ministerial level and the aim is to complete this discussion as soon as possible in order to allow the ESM Member States sufficient time to complete any necessary national procedures before the SSM is in place and operational later this year. It will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for, nor to establish the extent of, retrospective recapitalisation in advance of the Instrument being in place.</p><p>However, both I and my Government colleagues will ensure that Ireland's case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. </p></reply>

Its purpose is to ensure that resolution can take place at the same level as supervision, rather than being conducted at national level.   It is considered as an important contributing factor to breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector. </p><p>    The SRM will allow decisions to be made in a more objective and independent fashion than if they were been made by national supervisors. The proposal which has been agreed sees the SRM taking its decisions in line with the principles of resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in particular that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted, and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.  It is felt that in most scenarios, contributions by shareholders and creditors should be sufficient to finance resolution. If exceptionally, additional resources were needed a Single Resolution Fund with a target level of 1% of covered deposits within the Banking Union (approx. &euro;55bn) will come into place as a last resort to finance the bank resolution process.</p><p>   In the General Council approach reached on SRM at the extraordinary ECOFIN on 18 December 2013, it was agreed that as part of the overall compromise that aspects of the SRM relating to financing be carved out of the Regulation, in particular the transfer of contributions from national resolution funds to national compartments in the SRM, and gradual mutualisation of national compartments in the SRM. This approach was adopted because certain member states  were not satisfied that Article 114 provided an appropriate legal basis for the operation of the Single Resolution Fund. </p><p>  Under the recently reached agreement between the Greek Presidency and the European Parliament, the transition period to a fully mutualized SRF has been reduced to 8 years. In addition the pace of mutualisation has been significantly increased in such a way that within two years 60% mutualisation will occur with the balance being achieved in a linear fashion up until the end of year 8. </p><p>  What this means in practical terms is that if a bank is failing or likely to fail the first step is that the bail-in rules will be applied to losses. If there are still losses to be absorbed, the next point of contribution will be the funds within the Member State's national compartment in the SRF, followed by the mutualised part of the national compartments of other Member States. After 8 years the SRF will be fully mutualised. </p></reply>

The company commenced service on 7 March 2013 and has to date handled in excess of 1 million calls.  </p><p>The Help-Line service, which is provided in both the English and Irish languages, normally operates on a 9am/5pm Monday to Friday cycle, but during peak filing periods is extended to an 8am/8pm cycle and can include Saturday when required.</p><p>A key aspect of the service is the Provider s capacity to quickly scale operations up or down in response to call volumes. For example, the number of operators required can vary from 40 up to 275 at peak periods. The advantage of the contract from a cost perspective is that Revenue does not have to pay to keep operators in situ beyond what is needed to handle demand at any particular time and only pays for calls answered. The cost of the service is published on the Revenue website every quarter in accordance with Government policy in respect of all payments exceeding &euro;20,000. Revenue has confirmed to me that a total of &euro;3.583 million was paid for the service delivered during 2013.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that the data capture element of the LPT project is outsourced under the terms of a separate open competitive tender. The contract is currently held by Billpost who ensures that all paper LPT Returns are data captured within a 2 day turnaround period.  The total cost incurred by Revenue to date is &euro;288,075 in respect of 620,000 items data captured.</p><p>Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that the outsourcing of these components of the LPT/HHC operation has played a major role in the overall success of the project, which has so far yielded in excess of &euro;530m to the Exchequer. The use of outsourcing in this manner has also minimised the impact on other core Revenue operations.</p></reply>

This deadline was widely publicised both on the Revenue website, in newspaper advertisements and through interviews with Revenue spokespersons on local and national media during the six week period between 18 February and 31 March.  The Deputy will also be aware that, due to the volume of calls received on their helpline on 31 March, the Commissioners extended this deadline by two days to 2 April. </p><p>I am advised that as a result of their information campaign, many property owners have taken the necessary action to sort out their LPT affairs. To date, a compliance rate of 93% has been achieved for 2013 and the rate for 2014 currently stands at 88%. In relation to payment of Household Charge arrears, the Commissioners have confirmed that to date about &euro;5.6m has been paid directly to Revenue in respect of about 28,500 properties.  I am informed that Revenue is still handling significant numbers of contacts from property owners anxious to regularise their affairs.  </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to me that no interest or penalties have been charged to date on Local Property Tax arrears, however, as they have consistently stated over the past number of weeks, they will begin to impose these charges where a property owner does not engage with them.  In that regard, Section 149 of the 2012 Act provides for the charging of interest on late payment of LPT (including Household Charge) at an annual rate of 8%.  I should add that this rate is the same rate of interest charged on overdue income tax.</p><p>I, therefore, strongly encourage property owners to make immediate arrangements to pay any outstanding LPT and Household Charge arrears by accessing their LPT record on-line using their Property ID, PIN and PPSN.  Where assistance is required to file on-line, or where a person does not have their Property ID or PIN, they should call the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255. </p><p>While I appreciate the Deputy s comments about the hardship involved for certain sections of the community, as I explained earlier, the LPT legislation provides a wide range of payment options for property owners to avail of and to choose from based on the payment type that best suits their needs.  These include phased payment options by way of direct debit from certain credit union or bank accounts, or by deduction at source from occupational pensions and certain Government payments, including Department of Social Protection payments.  The property owner can also make regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the three payment service providers which are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend. </p><p>Also, specifically in cases where a person is having difficulty meeting their obligations,  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.  For example, an older person, whose only source of income is a payment from the Department of Social Protection would qualify for full deferral of the LPT charge, including any arrears of the Household Charge.  However, if a person has income in addition to any DSP payment, they will qualify for deferral if their gross annual income is less than &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple. They would qualify to defer 50% of their LPT charge where their gross annual income is less than &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for a couple and the remaining 50% of the tax must be paid. </p><p>Further details of the deferral arrangements available are set out on the Revenue website at .  The Commissioners also engaged extensively with Citizens  Information Centres and the deferral principles are well understood by their staff.  It is very important at this stage, as the Revenue Commissioners move into their compliance campaign, that anyone qualifying for deferral of the tax applies to the Revenue Commissioners as a matter of urgency.  Again, this can be done very easily by going on-line or contacting the LPT helpline.  </p><p>It is my firm view that LPT, in common with all other taxes and duties, must have a robust but reasonable set of sanctions open to the Revenue Commissioners to apply in appropriate cases.  Given the very high levels of voluntary compliance to date for LPT, there is an onus on the Commissioners to pursue the non-compliant and to impose appropriate additional charges.  The deferral options that I have legislated for are there to address hardship cases.  In view of the foregoing, I have no plans to amend the legislation in relation to the charging of interest and penalties on late payments of LPT.</p></reply>

However, the OECD has consistently stated that low corporation tax rates combined with a broad base is the best way to encourage economic growth while still maintaining tax revenues. That is what we have being doing for many years and what we will continue to do.</p><p>A reform of the Northern Ireland corporation tax rate and base has the potential to generate benefits in that part of the island, as well as on this side of the Border. Some commentators might see it as a case of Northern Ireland entering into direct competition with us on corporation tax, but I do not see it that way   I see it as having the potential to benefit both sides of the Border thereby providing an impetus for the island as a whole.</p><p>Of course there is strong evidence that a low corporation tax rate on its own will not be enough to attract significant FDI and we have consistently demonstrated that Ireland's attractiveness for foreign multi-national corporations is based on a whole range of factors   one of which happens to be our 12.5% tax rate.</p><p>I have not held any discussions with either the First Minister or the Deputy First Minister on the issue of equalising corporation tax rates between this State and Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Once out of the EDP, Ireland will have to meet its obligations under the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.   </p><p>The key objective is to achieve our Medium Term Budgetary Objective (MTO) of a balanced budget in structural terms in 2018.  Until we reach our MTO, discretionary revenue reductions have to be offset by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  Within these constraints, I will continue to work with my Department, as I have done in each of the last 3 years, to reform the taxation system to enhance economic growth and increase employment.  This will include reviewing and reforming, where appropriate, tax expenditures in the form of reliefs and incentives.   </p></reply>

Total cash interest on the floating rate bonds in 2013 was just under &euro;0.65 billion. Cash interest payable in 2014 is currently estimated to be just under &euro;0.8 billion, the increase compared to 2013 largely reflecting the fact that a full year's interest is payable this year. Interest payable on the bonds is currently projected to increase in the coming years, consistent with the projected increase in the six-month Euribor interest rate.</p><p>  The CBI is presently the holder of the entire portfolio of these floating rate bonds and on that basis, interest payable is currently accruing to the CBI. The CBI has undertaken that bonds to the minimum value indicated will be sold in accordance with the following schedule:  &euro;0.5 billion to end-2014, &euro;0.5 billion per annum in 2015-2018, &euro;1 billion per annum in 2019-2023 and &euro;2 billion per annum from 2024 onwards.

It is a matter for the Agency to decide when and how much to borrow in the light of those needs, commercial considerations surrounding the raising of debt on the markets and the need to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.</p><p>All monies raised through Government borrowing are paid into the Central Fund and used to fund Government spending as approved by the Oireachtas. It has never been the custom to  link borrowing to specific projects as to do so would limit the flexibility of the Government in managing the State's finances.</p><p>That said, there are a number of options available to individuals who wish to help support the Government's work in promoting economic growth and employment.</p><p>The National Solidarity Bonds were introduced to provide a wider range of options for retail investors. The Minister for Finance in announcing Budget 2010 launched the 10-year National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which was to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. Following the success of the launch of the ten-year National Solidarity Bond a four-year National Solidarity Bond was launched in 2011.</p><p>The NTMA's other State Savings products, available through any Post Office, allow people to support the Exchequer through Savings Bonds, Savings Certificates and Instalment Savings.</p><p>There are also possibilities in place for people interested in investing in longer-term Government bonds. Irish sovereign bonds are available through seventeen Primary Dealers recognised by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The NTMA has published information on their website () which gives the names and contact details for institutions which sell bonds to the public, and the fees they charge.</p><p>The NTMA will continue to encourage personal savers to purchase the National Solidarity Bonds and all the other NTMA State Savings products. The NTMA keeps the suite of State Savings products and the interest rates paid on them under constant review to ensure that the products remain competitive and attractive to retail investors. These products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances.</p><p>I am happy to confirm that the Government remains committed to exploring alternative means of financing capital projects. The Government has announced the creation of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. Within its existing statutory investment policy and in line with the ISIF announcement, the NPRF has undertaken a number of investments and initiatives under which NPRF capital will be invested on a commercial basis in Ireland.  The NPRF has in particular committed to invest in infrastructure (&euro;250 million) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects   (&euro;118 million).</p></reply>

This includes providing customer support, updating the register and processing returns and payments for LPT. This year, up to 31 March, some  82,000 telephone calls and about 90,000 items of correspondence have been handled by Revenue staff in relation to LPT and Household charge.</p><p>  As the Revenue Commissioners announced some weeks ago, a final opportunity was afforded to property owners to bring their LPT and Household charge affairs up to date before they begin to focus on tackling LPT non-compliance. This  will commence in the coming weeks as soon as Revenue has processed the large volume of payments and correspondence, of which there is about 40,000 items on hand, received up to 31 March.  The Commissioners advise me that they expect to deploy 40-50 full time staff initially on this work.</p><p>  In regard to LPT staffing, it is internationally recognised that property taxes require proportionately more resources to administer compared to other forms of taxation.  However, the introduction of property taxes needs to be considered in the context of broadening the overall tax base to achieve a more sustainable fiscal position.  I am satisfied that Revenue has prioritised its staffing resources appropriately to ensure the successful introduction of a significant new tax.</p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009 in the context of government policy   Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 at the end of 2008 to its current level of 5,757.  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt management.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to tackling tax and duty evasion, including the shadow economy. Revenue is committed to ensuring that despite the staff reductions that this compliance work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>  The return on investment can vary depending on the activity and the availability of suitably trained and experienced staff. There is a very different grade and skills mix, for example, between LPT and  revenue audit activity.  Reassigning staff from one activity to another would require significant investment in learning and development before they become fully effective in their new role. Once fully trained, the direct return on investment for a Revenue auditor could be expected to be &euro;10 for every &euro;1 spent.</p></reply>

The delays were a direct result of the very heavy volumes of telephone queries received, which exceeded 40,000 for the three days up to and including 31 March.</p><p>  In response to the service demand, Revenue extended the compliance deadline from 31 March to 5pm on 2 April and significantly increased the number of call agents on both the Helpline and on the internal customer support service. Revenue also extended the opening hours from 9am/5pm to 8am/8pm up to the extended deadline.</p><p>  Significantly, Revenue confirmed through its various media campaigns and through recorded messages on its Helpline that anyone who left contact details on the Helpline recording system would receive a call back as soon as possible and would be considered compliant providing the issue/s in question was dealt with in a timely fashion once the call back was received. Equally so, anyone who corresponded in writing or by email would also be considered compliant on the same basis.</p><p>  I would like to remind the Deputy that the due date for payment of HHC arrears was 1 July 2013 while the due date for payment of 2014 LPT was 1 January 2014, with the exception of the single debit authority (SDA) payment option deadline of 21 March. On that basis, property owners have had significant periods of time to get their affairs in order. Considering the statutory deadlines have already passed, Revenue is to be commended for the efforts it has made through the extended deadline/s to give people the opportunity to meet their obligations without having to suffer the consequences of extra liabilities that can be levied in the event of late or non-payment.</p><p>  The Deputy should also be aware that, to assist taxpayers meet their LPT/HHC obligations at a time that best suits individual circumstances, Revenue has developed an easy to use online system, which includes the full suite of available payment, deferral and exemption options. The online system is available 24 hours a day and in most instances removes the need for liable persons to make any contact with Revenue.</p><p>  It needs to be borne in mind that Revenue has taken LPT from concept to a fully functioning tax in a very short period of time a task that included the drafting of legislation, the building of a brand new property register and the provision of customer service to such a large volume of taxpayers. LPT has contributed &euro;533m to the Exchequer in respect of 2013 and 2014 year to date.</p></reply>

The CCMA was put in place under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the CCMA.</p><p>The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in mortgage difficulty. It also sets out that mortgage arrears and pre-arrears cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.</p><p>The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre-arrears. This framework is known as the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which sets out the steps which lenders must follow:</p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;</p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrowers circumstances; and </p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution.</p><p>In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable for each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender having assessed the borrower's financial circumstances using the Standard Financial Statement (SFS).</p><p>If a borrower is offered an alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must give the borrower a clear explanation of the proposed arrangement and how it works, including the reason why the lender considers it to be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower. The lender must also provide the borrower with the advantages of the offer and explain any disadvantages.</p><p>If the lender is not offering the borrower any alternative repayment arrangement, the lender must give the reasons why in writing. The lender must also inform the borrower that a copy of the most recent SFS is available on request, and provide the borrower with details in writing, including:</p><p>&middot; other options available to the borrower, such as voluntary surrender, trading down, mortgage to rent or voluntary sale and the implications of each option for the borrower and his/her mortgage loan account </p><p>- the borrower's right to make an appeal to the lender's internal Appeals Board </p><p>- the website of the Insolvency Service of Ireland</p><p>- that legal proceedings may commence three months from the date the letter is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later</p><p>- that the borrower should notify the lender if his/her circumstances improve; </p><p>- the importance of seeking independent legal and/or financial advice.</p><p>Borrowers can also make an appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as &quot;not co-operating&quot;. If a borrower is not happy with the way that their lender is dealing with them, or if they think the lender are not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. If the borrower is not happy with the outcome of the complaint made to the lender they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO). Further information on how to make a complaint to the FSO is available at .</p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) applies to the mortgage loan of a borrower which is secured by his/her primary residence and it also applies to a buy-to-let mortgage where the buy-to-let is the only residential property in the State owned by the borrower.  A lender is only required to use a SFS to obtain financial information from a borrower in arrears or in pre-arrears where the loan is a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  However, this does not preclude a lender from using the SFS in respect of other loans.</p></reply>

The Register was populated using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from various utility companies. The various data sets were cross-checked by Revenue to ensure the accuracy of the information in respect of each property being included on the Property Register.</p><p>  However, given the scale of the project it was inevitable that there would be some errors and in a small number of instances, properties were either duplicated to, or omitted from, the Property Register. Revenue clearly indicated this possibility in all of its communications in regard to LPT and stressed that in such circumstances the onus was on property owners to make contact and provide the correct details.</p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question did not receive any notification in respect of either his 2013 or 2014 LPT liabilities from Revenue because the Property Register did not hold any record of his property.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that the Property Register has now been updated to reflect the property details and the person will receive all future correspondence and notifications.</p><p>  Revenue has also confirmed that the person has filed and paid in respect of both his 2013 and 2014 LPT liabilities at this point and has committed to pay his arrears of Household Charge (HHC) as soon as possible.

This allowed the Bank retain its life assurance subsidiary New Ireland.  As part of this amendment, the Bank committed to certain substitution measures including the sale of the ICS distribution platform together with, at the option of a purchaser, up to &euro;1bn of mortgages and up to &euro;1bn of matching deposits. The purpose of the ICS substitution measure is to support new entities in entering the Irish market and thereby increasing competition to the ultimate benefit of the consumer.</p><p>  In order to facilitate the sale, the State committed to enact appropriate legislation, the effect of which is to extend the same powers to building societies that currently exist for banks to transfer assets and liabilities to other banks. ICS is the sole remaining building society in Ireland.</p><p>  As the decision to acquire loans is at the option of the purchaser of the distribution platform, and as the value of loans so acquired can range up to &euro;1bn, it is not possible to know, or even estimate with any accuracy, the number of loans that may be sold. I can confirm, however, that the total value of the ICS loan book is c.&euro;6bn and the number of loans is c. 40,000.</p><p>  Although the proposed legislative change does not preclude an unregulated entity from acquiring a portion of the ICS mortgage portfolio, the probability of such an outcome must be considered in conjunction with the purpose of the commitment and the safeguards included in the Restructuring Plan. The Restructuring Plan includes a provision that &quot;In order to be approved by the Commission, the purchaser must meet the Purchaser requirements&quot; which covers, inter alia, that the Purchaser &quot;must have the financial resources, proven expertise and incentive to maintain and develop the Divestment business as a viable and active competitive force in competition with BoI and other competitors&quot;.</p><p>  With reference to the wider issue of CCMA protection for residential mortgage borrowers who have had their loans sold by a bank to an unregulated entity, the Deputy will be aware that The Sale of Loan Books to Unregulated Third Parties Bill, which is listed in the Government legislative programme, was always intended to address concerns surrounding the continued applicability of the code after the sale of loan books to unregulated entities. The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation to protect mortgage holders and will work with other interested parties to achieve the best solution for consumers. Officials in my Department are examining this fully with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's Office.</p></reply>

If the consumer meets the definition of 'consumer', i.e., a natural person acting outside the person's business, the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 would apply.  In addition, the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 would apply to buy-to-lets for consumers (as defined), including, in the case of personal consumers, the provisions of Chapter 8 relating to arrears handling. The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) would apply to buy-to-lets where the buy-to-let is the only residential property in this State owned by the borrower.</p></reply>

Section 156 also made Revenue responsible for the collection of the outstanding arrears.  </p><p>  In setting up LPT, Revenue received the HHC Register from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and used it to form part of the building blocks of the LPT Register. As part of the matching process, Revenue cross-referenced both registers to identify a database of properties for which the HHC is still outstanding. However, it is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:</p><p>  - The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.</p><p>  - The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. For example, some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC but the LGMA Register did not capture such exemption details in all cases. For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, Revenue has advised me that any property owner can look up the Revenue online system and see if the Register shows an outstanding HHC arrear in respect of their property. Given the difficulties in matching the records to 100% accuracy, I would strongly recommend anyone who has paid the HHC or who was exempt from the HHC to do this and if the &euro;200 charge is on record, correct the information before Revenue starts its compliance programme.  Revenue has also confirmed to me that it is still in the process of dealing with the large amount of payments, correspondence and telephone queries received in respect of HHC in the period up to the extended 'compliance' deadline of 2 April 2014. This work will be completed in approximately two weeks at which point Revenue will begin its compliance campaign. I would strongly encourage anyone who owes the HHC to go online and pay the &euro;200 before the compliance campaign begins.</p><p>  In regard to the compliance campaign, none of the actions listed in the Deputy's question have yet taken place in relation to the Household Charge.  Revenue has advised that because liable persons did not previously receive any correspondence from the LGMA in respect of amounts outstanding and because Revenue never initiates debt collection/enforcement activity without prior warning, the initial step will be to write to those people that have a HCC charge arrear on the Register. They will be advised of the liability and the steps they should take if they have already paid the amount indicated as due. They will also be advised on the steps to take if they were exempt from the HHC. For those who are taxed through the PAYE system they will also be advised that an instruction will issue to their employer or occupational pension provider to deduct the &euro;200 charge from their wages/pension between May and December of this year. Recipients of the letter will then have a ten-day period to choose an alternative payment method to prevent the instruction issuing to their employer.</p><p>  For those whose only income is from the Department of Social Protection and who are likely to qualify for a deferral, they will be offered that opportunity. Revenue will also write to non-PAYE/DSP property owners to provide them with the opportunity to correct the record and to advise them that the charge will be subject to the debt collection and enforcement measures as outlined in the Deputy's question.  Finally, Revenue has assured me that any liable person in respect of HHC who left contact details with the LPT Helpline, or who wrote or emailed and has yet to receive a reply will be considered compliant and will not be subject to either debt collection/enforcement activity or interest charges, providing they meet their obligations immediately after their queries are resolved.</p></reply>

Interest can only be deducted during the period in which the property is let.</p><p>Information on interest relief for rental property is based on all claims for such relief in Form 11 personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers. It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers (in the income tax return Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system at present. However, a PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete a Form 11 return. Interest relief associated with corporate landlords is not captured on the corporate tax CT1 return and is therefore not available.</p><p>I am also informed by the Commissioners that it is not possible from Revenue data to distinguish relief claimed by &quot;buy to let&quot; landlords. By this, I assume the Deputy means landlords that purchase property for rental purposes, often with a mortgage specifically granted for this purpose.  Based on personal income tax Form 11 returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for 2008 to 2012, the latest year available, the estimated amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against rental income is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost  &euro;m (for both residential &amp;amp; commercial properties)</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>1,210</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>763</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>672</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>691</td></tr><tr><td>2012 (provisional)</td><td>575</td></tr></table></p><p>The estimates in the table are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could, therefore, be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.

The figures for 2012 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</p></reply>

Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme. The first year of the programme was 2012 and employer returns received to date for 2012 have provided the following results:</p><p>  Numbers of employees availing of the scheme - 9;</p><p>  Numbers of employers with employees availing - 8;</p><p>  Number of jobs created - 5.</p><p>  Further claims for SARP are provided in the Form 11 tax returns for 2012, filed by self-assessed income tax cases (2012 returns were due in October/November 2013). Based on the most recent analysis of these returns the number of individuals availing of the scheme was 6.  Other information in relation to these individuals, such as numbers of employers and jobs created, is not required to be provided by taxpayers in the Form 11 tax return and is therefore not available.  Corresponding figures for 2013 are not yet available.</p></reply>

The provision applies as respects the years 2012, 2013 and 2014.  The scheme was extended in Finance Act 2013 to include travel to Nigeria, Senegal, Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Tanzania for 2013 and 2014.  </p><p>  The full year estimated cost to the Exchequer of the Foreign Earnings Deduction scheme for the 2012 tax year was &euro;0.6 million in respect of 83 employees.

It is my role as Minister for Finance to put in place an appropriate legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector. The Central Bank is responsible for prudential supervision and financial regulation including consumer protection. The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent office established to deal with consumer complaints about their dealings with financial institutions. Therefore, I believe that we have a robust regulatory framework in Ireland to deal with issues such as computer problems that may affect customers of banks operating here.</p><p>  Whilst I did not receive a full report into the computer failure at Ulster Bank in Summer 2012 from the Central Bank or FSO, my Department is aware of the steps taken to resolve the issue. I am aware that Ulster Bank worked with the Central Bank of Ireland on a restitution plan for customers affected by its IT system failure in 2012. Implementation of the redress plan was actively monitored by the Central Bank via submission of weekly reports from Ulster Bank checking the level and type of complaints. Two on-site visits were carried out in September and November 2012 to ensure that the redress plan was being followed and that customers  interests were being protected. These concluded that Ulster Bank was dealing with claims in accordance with the redress plan.  The Deputy will be aware that the Financial Services Ombudsman spoke about his engagement with Ulster Bank on this issue at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 5 March 2014.</p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it expects all firms to have adequate systems and controls in place and where issues that impact customers arise they should be addressed and rectified urgently, particularly as customers are increasingly using and becoming dependent on online and mobile banking services.  In this regard, the Central Bank expects firms to communicate clearly and promptly with affected customers when a technical incident occurs, including details of the impacted service, details of alternative access to services and an undertaking that identifiable loss will be remediated.  The Central Bank's expectations have been communicated to banks.</p><p>  The payments system is monitored by the Irish Payments Services Organisation (IPSO). IPSO, in conjunction with the Central Bank, has implemented an annual Risk Assessment exercise with the Clearing Banks.  This annual process assesses the risk management capabilities across the Banks in relation to payments activities. The submissions from the Banks are externally validated.</p></reply>

The stakeholders met as part of this pre-consultation were as follows: MABS/CIB; FLAC; FSO; ISI; Troika; IBF; and Other individual consumer advocates. </p><p>  While the process of pre-consultation assisted in informing the Central Bank of the issues to be considered in the Consultation Paper, the revised CCMA was informed by a public consultation process with in excess of 200 submissions received, in addition to findings of consumer research and inspections of lenders' compliance by the Central Bank with certain aspects of the CCMA.</p></reply>

The Commissioners have confirmed that by the end of December 2013, &euro;318m had been transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer in respect of LPT.  Of this amount, &euro;242m was in respect of LPT for 2013 and &euro;76m relates to 2014 LPT. By the end of March 2014, a further &euro;214.3m was transferred by Revenue to the Exchequer. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the deadline for property owners to bring their LPT affairs (including the Household Charge) up to date and avoid interest and penalties was 2 April 2014.  I am advised by the Commissioners that their current priority is processing the large volume of Returns and payments received and they expect to publish more detailed data and analysis in due course.</p><p>While the 2014 forecasted yield for LPT is &euro;550 million, the Commissioners advise that it is not possible to state the precise amount of LPT which is expected to be collected for 2014 for each city and county council. A number of factors could affect the outcome, including the continuation of the strong level of voluntary compliance that was achieved in 2013, the impact of Revenue s national compliance programme to follow up with those liable persons who have failed to meet their LPT obligations for 2013 and 2014, and the compliance programme for the collection of arrears of household charge/LPT.  </p><p>I am advised that these factors will also, most likely, affect the outcome for 2015.  The Deputy will also be aware that Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) allows elected members of a local authority to pass a formal resolution to vary the basic rate of LPT by up to 15% for their functional area, which may result in a lower or higher LPT rate applying for 2015, with a corresponding impact on the LPT yield for 2015. </p><p>The published LPT data for 2013 and 2014 are readily available to all local authorities from the Revenue website. I am advised by the Commissioners that the 2013 statistics could be used as a basis for providing an estimate of the projected amount of LPT to be collected in the local authority area for 2014 and 2015, by doubling the 2013 figure (since a half year charge applied in 2013). </p><p>I am further advised that the Revenue Commissioners have had extensive engagement with local authorities over the past eighteen months, both directly with authorities themselves and through a series of meetings with representatives of the City &amp;amp; County Managers Association (CCMA) and its sub-groups.  The Commissioners, I am also informed, are keen to ensure that the process of engagement continues and to provide any assistance to local authorities that they can.   </p></reply>

The basic LPT rate can be increased or decreased by up to 15%.

This statutory deadline is to ensure that all the necessary administrative arrangements can be put in place for the payment of LPT at the appropriate rate in 2015 and most importantly, that property owners are given adequate notice of their LPT liability for 2015 to enable them to select their preferred payment method in good time for the filing date.  </p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of their customer service and information campaign they have already commenced engagement with local authorities in relation to the LAF.

A single farm payment entitlement is a chargeable asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes and once acquired it may be disposed of by way of sale, gift etc. Accordingly, gains arising from the disposal of single farm payment entitlements are chargeable to CGT in the same way as gains made on any other chargeable assets. Where total gains in any year do not exceed &euro;1,270 they are not chargeable to CGT.</p><p>  With regard to the transfer of single farm payment entitlements for VAT purposes, where a payment entitlement is sold without land then VAT is due at the standard rate on the sale if the sale proceeds exceed the relevant threshold for VAT registration (currently &euro;37,500). However, where a payment entitlement and land are sold together to a person who intends to carry on the farming business, then the sale may be treated as the transfer of a business and not subject to VAT. There may be other less significant tax implications in certain instances.</p><p>  Officials in my Department are considering this issue with officials from the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine. However, I have no plans at this time to alter the tax treatment referred to above.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.407.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800058#WRG01600"><p> I am of the view that the agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism is a significant achievement that helps increase the stability of banks and the overall banking system in the participating Member States and should also significantly reduce the spill-over effects of crises into non-participating Member States  and as such will facilitate the functioning of the internal market.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) is a centralised resolution mechanism for Member States who belong to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Its purpose is to ensure that resolution can take place at the same level as supervision, rather than being conducted at national level.   It is considered an important contributing factor to breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector. </p><p>  The SRM will allow decisions to be made in a more objective and independent fashion than if they were been made by national supervisors. The proposal which has been agreed sees the SRM taking its decisions in line with the principles of resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in particular that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted, and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.  </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the size of the fund, the expectation is that in most scenarios, contributions by shareholders and creditors should be sufficient to finance resolution. If exceptionally, additional resources were needed, the Single Resolution Fund with a target level of 1% of covered deposits within the Banking Union (approx. &euro;55bn) will come into place as a last resort to finance the bank resolution process. This target level was calibrated by the European Commission when the proposal was first published and it takes account of the fact that losses will firstly be applied to the institutions' shareholders and creditors. The SRM regulation also requires the Board of the SRM to contract financial  arrangements for the Single Resolution Fund  where the amounts raised through contributions from institutions' are not sufficient to meet the Fund's obligations. </p><p>  It is important to keep in mind that resolution is just one aspect of the package of financial reforms being introduced to restore confidence in the banking system and to make it more resilient to future financial crisis. There are also a number of measures within the resolution proposals and within other legislative reforms that require banks to organise themselves in such a way that greatly reduces the risk of their failure but also ensures they have appropriate mechanisms in place to withstand future crises should they arise. The powers of supervisors will also be significantly enhanced to ensure that they are in a position to impose requirements on banks that are commensurate with the level of risk on their books. </p><p>  Better regulated and supervised banks will be stronger, more resilient, and operate to benefit the real economy at large, as well as ensuring that taxpayers don't have to foot the bill for banks' mistakes. The resolution framework will be there to ensure that there is a mechanism in place at EU level to deal with future bank failures should they arise, but reinforced supervision and robust preventative measures are key in minimising the risk of this happening and reducing any costs likely to arise. </p><p>  On the issue of the timetable, it should be noted that the final agreement on the SRM reduces the transition period to a fully mutualised Single Resolution Fund from ten years down to eight years and I am supportive of this change. It also provides for accelerated mutualisation in the early years - 60% by the end of year 2. This is a very important feature and demonstrates the seriousness of Member States to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.435.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800058#WRG03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 to 165, inclusive, together. </p><p>In my Budget day speech in October of last year I outlined the Government s approach to restoring the economy to sustainable growth. This programme involves inter alia a sector-by-sector approach, where the Government looked to build on areas of strength of the economy and repair those sectors which were damaged. I am pleased to report that this approach has proven successful, with some noticeable gains recorded in some of the economy s key sectors over the last year.</p><p>Looking first at the agri-food and fisheries sector, which is Ireland s largest indigenous industry and a significant contributor to employment, 2013 proved a very successful year for the sector with strong employment growth over the year. Exports (in value terms) related to the agricultural sector increased by 7 per cent in 2013 and year-to-date outturn figures combined with the continued signs of recovery in key trading partners such as the UK augur well for further growth in 2014.</p><p>Another jobs-rich sector, which suffered greatly due to the global economic downturn, and one to which the Government has introduced a series of targeted policy initiatives, has been tourism. Last year was particularly strong for the tourism sector, with overseas trips to Ireland increasing by 7 per cent in annual terms. This was aided by the reduced VAT rate for products and services in place since July 2011, as well as by The Gathering, which contributed to a 14 per cent increase in tourism from North America in 2013. Encouragingly, the growth we have seen in the number of visitors to Ireland has also been reflected in the employment gains in the sector, with employment in accommodation and food services up by 13 per cent in the final quarter of 2013 when compared with the same period in 2011   after the VAT reduction was introduced. Another positive point is that the strong momentum gained in 2013 looks to have carried over into this year, with trips to Ireland up 11.3 per cent for the period December 2013 to February 2014 in year-on-year terms.</p><p> Of course, no sector was hit harder in the recession than the construction sector and while nobody wishes to see a return to the construction-reliant economy that preceded the downturn, some recovery in the sector is vital to support wider economic growth. On this front recent developments have been positive, with signs of a recovery in the sector following nearly six years of continuous decline. Employment in the sector has now stabilised while national accounts data show building and construction investment increasing by 12 per cent in 2013. </p><p>National residential property prices have begun to recover, having fallen 51 per cent from peak to trough. While this has largely been driven by a recovery in property prices in Dublin, prices outside of the capital now appear to have bottomed out and were up by 4.2 per cent over the year to February. As part of Budget 2014 I introduced measures to address the limitations of supply of suitable housing stock that seem to be impacting the Dublin market, including the extension of the Living City Initiative and the Home Renovation Initiative.  The Government s Medium-Term Economic Strategy for the period 2014-2020 set out the intention to address remaining challenges in the construction sector. As part of this the Government will be publishing a strategy for a renewed construction sector in the near future.</p><p>In terms of overall price developments, the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)   the comparative measurement of inflation across Europe   increased by 0.5 per cent in Ireland for 2013 as a whole. The energy effect that was so pronounced in 2012 was not present in 2013, which was the predominant driver of the lower headline HICP over the year.</p><p>In February, annual HICP inflation was 0.1 per cent as energy and unprocessed food continued to act as a drag on inflation. Stripping out these two elements, core inflation measured 0.7 per cent which compares with a figure of 1.1 per cent for the euro area as a whole. </p><p>Irish core inflation has now been below, or on par with, euro area inflation for every month since February 2009. This has led to significant cost competitiveness gains over this period, while also serving to protect real incomes. Inflationary pressures are expected to remain relatively muted once again this year. Revised forecasts will be published in the Stability Programme Update to be published later this month.   </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, bank fees, charges  and commissions are subject to regulation under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended. Section 149 came into effect in 1996 and currently requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make an  application to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce a new customer charge or increase any existing customer charge in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not apply to interest rates; it applies to fees, charges  and commissions only. </p><p>The basis for setting bank charges, both nationally and internationally, is based on a number of factors and is at the commercial discretion of the bank.</p><p>As required by the Troika, my Department published a review of the regulation of bank fees and charges; the review is available on the website . </p><p>The review found that:</p><p>- net fee and commission income divided by average assets in Irish banks was well below the average of their peers; and</p><p>- net fee and commission are lower in the Irish banks than in their European peers relative to net interest income.</p><p>The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to repeal Section 149 at this time. The lack of competition in the banking sector means that the repeal of section 149 would give unfettered price setting power to the incumbent banks.  The report recommends that this issue should be revisited when competition in the banking sector has improved significantly.  It is my view that the current regulatory regime offers appropriate protection to consumers against unjustified increases in bank fees and commissions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.448.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800059#WRH00200"><p>The Government places a high priority on job creation and the recent labour market figures are very positive in this regard.  Employment growth of 2.4% in 2013 marked an end to five consecutive years of employment declines.  Employment levels have now returned to those last seen in Q4 2010.   </p><p>These positive trends demonstrate the effectiveness of recent labour market initiatives taken by the Government.  The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiated over 270 measures to promote job creation across all sectors of the Irish economy.  Initiatives included launching a new development capital scheme aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth indigenous companies; extending the corporation tax exemption for start-up companies; and the creation of a micro finance fund and a targeted temporary partial credit guarantee for SMEs.   </p><p>The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs built on the success of these measures by initiating a range of new reforms such as the creation of a single licensing application for the retail sector in order to reduce the compliance burden of the industry; increasing computing programme places, reskilling workshops and conversion courses; investing heavily in new research facilities for big data; introducing an online trading voucher to the value of &euro;2,500 to help get more SMEs trading online; and the introduction of the JobsPlus incentive scheme to encourage businesses to recruit the long-term unemployed.   </p><p>Budget 2013 introduced the Ten-Point Tax Reform Plan to support SMEs to improve cash flow, access to funding and to lower costs and administrative burdens facing SMEs.  Provision of NPRF-backed equity investment, credit provision and restructuring/recovery investment funds for SMEs also contributed to boosting employment in the sector.  Most recently, in Budget 2014, a &euro;500 million pro-jobs package was introduced, with targeted measures for the different sectors of the economy<b>. </b>Under the 2011 Jobs initiative the VAT rate was reduced for the hospitality sector, and the Government continued this measure in Budget 2014.  The Home Renovation Incentive was introduced providing homeowners with tax relief on repair, renovation or improvement work.  To support entrepreneurs the Start Your Own Business initiative was introduced which provides an income tax exemption of &euro;40,000 on the profits of a new business started by an unemployed individual.  To support the labour-intensive tourism industry, the air travel tax was removed.   </p><p>Building on the measures introduced in previous Budgets and action plans, the Government's recent Action Plan for Jobs 2014 sets out sectoral priorities and quantifiable actions to support sectors with employment growth potential (Agri-Food, ICT, international financial services), sectors of emerging opportunity (Green economy, creative industries, aviation and health care services) and mature sectors (tourism, retail, construction).</p><p>The job creation measures initiated by this Government over the last three years have helped promote the recent employment recovery and - along with new reform initiatives - will help ensure the Government's medium-term goal of ensuring a return to full employment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.452.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800059#WRH00500"><p>Neither my Department nor the Central Bank of Ireland maintains information on the costs of insurance in Ireland.  Neither do we hold information on insurance costs across the European Union.</p><p>The calculation of annual premium rates is a commercial decision for the insurance company in question.  It should be noted that the ability of the Government to influence the competitiveness of insurance costs is limited as Insurance companies are required under European law to price in accordance with risk and neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland have the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products.  </p><p>While competition in the market place acts as the best constraint on insurance costs, insurance companies have to be conscious of their prudential obligations and are required by the Central Bank of Ireland to meet their capital requirements on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the sustainability of their business.  In circumstances where they are exposed to a high level of claims, it is possible that their capital position can be effected with a consequential effect on prices.  In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers across the EU known as Solvency II, which will come into force from the start of 2016, will place a greater emphasis on the need to price risk appropriately than the existing regime, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy.  This will benefit the consumer in many instances. However, in circumstances where there has been a significant increase in claims, it is possible that there will be higher premiums.</p><p>It is worth noting that past initiatives, in particular the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and legislation to improve road safety which has reduced accidents significantly, continue to make a major contribution to keeping insurance costs at a reasonable level.  Finally, a significant contributing factor to a more competitive market has been the introduction of  greater transparency in the price of insurance products enabling cost comparisons be carried out e.g. the National Consumers Agency's focus on providing information to consumers on financial service products including insurance on the &quot;Its your Money&quot; website ().  This allows consumers to respond to price changes and shop around.</p></reply>

The payment of this allowance was later extended to those persons in receipt of social welfare disability payments to introduce equality of treatment for all people in FAS training.</p><p>  The payment was reduced from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week as part of Budget 2011.  In the present economic situation this incentive is no longer considered appropriate and as part of Budget 2014 it was decided to cease this payment for all SOLAS participants commencing courses after 1st January 2014.  This change does not apply to persons who commenced a course prior to January 2014 who will continue to receive the long term unemployed bonus payment for the duration of their course.  This is a decision taken in the context of the overall savings this Department had to find for 2014 and future years.  It was taken against a difficult budgetary background and there is no scope to re-visit it.</p></reply>

Further data on the number of teachers registered on the basis of recognised PE qualifications in Ireland in recent years is shown in the following table.</p><p>  My Department is not involved in allocating places on third level PE courses and therefore I do not have information to hand on the current number of places.  However the data in the table shows an increasing trend.  This Government remains committed to protecting and enhancing the educational experience of children.  Despite the difficult economic climate, my Department has been able to protect frontline education services in 2014 by identifying sufficient expenditure savings and efficiencies.  This includes provision for additional teachers in primary and post primary schools as well as additional resource teachers for children with special educational needs as announced in Budget 2014.</p><p>  In the coming years, significant increases are expected in the number of school going children.  In relation to facilities, generally, the delivery of major school projects to meet significant demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  My Department's Five Year Construction Plan is focused on meeting those demographic needs and sets out the school projects that are planned to proceed to construction over the duration of the Plan. </p><p>  Alongside the building of infrastructure, we are also preparing for the need to have more teachers in the system.  I have asked the Teaching Council to examine the matter of teacher supply and I expect to receive an initial report from the Council later in the year.</p><p><b>Number of teachers registered on the basis of recognised PE qualifications in Ireland</b><table><tr><th>REGISTRATION YEARS</th><th>NUMBER OF TEACHERS </th></tr><tr><td>2009/2010</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>2010/2011</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>2011/2012</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>2012/2013</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td>2013/2014**</td><td>356</td></tr></table>** 2013/2014 was the year in which mandatory registration came into effect and many teachers who had not previously registered applied for registration.</p></reply>

New post primary schools that are constructed as part of my Department's school building programme, include provision for facilities such as P.E. halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.  Other facilities, such as outdoor pitches, are provided where this is appropriate and within the context of available resources.  Many post primary schools also use adjacent local and community facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. </p><p>  Due to current financial constraints, it is not possible at this time to approve applications from existing post primary schools for additional P.E. facilities as priority is given to essential mainstream classroom accommodation.  The current  P.E. curriculum has been designed on the basis that sports facilities in schools, or that are accessible by schools, may vary.  New specifications for PE are currently being finalised by the NCCA for both Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.</p><p>The implementation of the P.E. curriculum is only one element of the important work that is being undertaken by post primary schools in relation to tackling obesity and promoting a 'Healthy Ireland'.  It is complemented by an emphasis on general well-being and healthy eating through Social, Personal and Health Education, healthy eating policies, initiatives such as the Active Schools Flag, extra-curricular activities, the 'sport for all day', and physical education teacher professional networks.  If the work of schools in promoting physical activity is to be effective it has to be complemented by the efforts of parents, communities and wider society.  This is one of the key messages in the 'Get Active' Framework which was launched by the Taoiseach in October 2013.</p></reply>

My Department also provides July Provision for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, home based provision may be grant aided.</p><p>  The school is question has not applied to participate in the scheme.  Where a school chooses not to extend their services for July, eligible children in the school will be granted home based July Provision, on application.  As the home based provision takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.</p><p>  Home tutors should be fully qualified teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then consideration will be given to the engagement of a tutor who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum level 7 FETAC) in a relevant area including e.g. psychology.  If an SNA meets these standards they can also be considered in this context. </p><p>  Under the terms of the home based scheme, allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle.  The pupil teacher ratio in school settings can result in one teacher being allocated to a class of six pupils with children of mixed age and ability at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.  However, in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations can be considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing sound reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.</p></reply>

Over 23,000 children access SNA services.</p><p>The total number of Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) SNA posts currently allocated by the NCSE is 10,656 posts including 8,537 posts at primary level and 2,119 posts at post primary level.</p><p>The total number of WTE SNA posts at the end of the 2011/12 was 10,320 including 8,315 at primary level and 2,005 at post primary level. The total number of WTE SNA posts at the end of the 2012/13 was 10,487 including 8,435 at primary level and 2,052 at post primary level. A whole time equivalent SNA post equates to 32 hours per week.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. </p><p>The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<table><tr><th>SNA Resources   </th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th></tr><tr><td>Number of Special Needs Assistants</td><td>10,117<br /><br /><br />(10,320)*</td><td>10,390<br /><br /><br />(10,487)*</td><td>10,585 (end-Dec 2013)</td><td>10,656 (end-April 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Pupils supported by SNAs</td><td>Over 22,000</td><td>Over22,000/ <br /><br /><br />Over 23,000</td><td>Over 23,000</td><td>Allocation process in train</td></tr></table>*The SNA figures for 2011 and 2012 show the allocation at the end of the calendar year as well as the figures for the respective school years (in brackets). </p><p>The figures for 2013 and 2014 show the number of SNA posts allocated to date in the 2013/14 school year.

As a result of the review, qualification allowances were abolished with effect from 1st February 2012.  Department of Education and Skills Circular 0008/2013 outlines the effect of this decision on teachers.  The Circular was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of the teacher representative bodies, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, chaired by an official of the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>  In Paragraph 12 of Circular 0008/2013 an exception is made in the case 'where as at 5 December 2011, a teacher in employment on that date and eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of the post they held on that date, was actively undertaking a course of further study leading to an additional qualification, provided that the teacher does not cease to be a registered student on that course before its completion. Such individuals may apply to the Department/VEC as appropriate for a derogation from the general position within 3 months of the date of receipt of the award'.</p><p>  As the person concerned was not a teacher in employment on 5 December 2011 and not eligible for receipt of a qualification allowance in respect of any teaching post on that date they do not qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the qualification related to the course being undertaken at that time.</p></reply>

It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the school concerned. </p><p>  Section 29 of the Act sets out a limited set of circumstances a parent can appeal administrative decisions of a school. These are confined to expulsions, suspensions or refusal to enroll. The Government has approved the drafting of the Admissions to School Bill 2014 in which the extent to which refusal to enroll will or will not be subject to a Section 29 appeal will be addressed.</p><p>  I am not satisfied with the current provisions of Section 28. I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a Parent and Student Charter. I plan to consult with the Ombudsman for Children's Office on this matter. Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a Charter. Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important. If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision parents are more likely to accept the fairness of decisions. </p></reply>

We are fortunate that over 90% of our young people stay on to Senior cycle and complete the Leaving Certificate.  The Junior Cycle is no longer a high stakes examination.</p><p>  I want the JCSA to be a support for learning.  I know that teachers are capable of assessing their own students at this level, it happens in other jurisdictions.  Irish teachers are a particularly well qualified and professional cohort and can bring this expertise to bear on assessment which is a key part of the learning process.  To support teachers, it is important to realise that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) will continue to externally mark the terminal written examinations for English, Irish and Maths in a transitional period, while the system becomes familiar with the challenges presented by changed assessment approaches.  For all other subjects, the SEC will provide a timetable, the final paper and  a detailed marking scheme.  The school-based assessment of these subjects will include a process of internal moderation.  Discussions are currently ongoing regarding the possibility of providing external supports for such moderation.</p><p>  Extensive quality assurance measures are being built into the new Junior Cycle. These include, for example, the Assessment and Moderation Toolkit (which will include exemplars of student work outlining standards) and CPD to enable the teachers to understand and implement the standards being sought with confidence. </p></reply>

Ireland only ranked 17th of the 28 OECD countries who took part in the study, and 22nd out of all 44 participating countries.   Ireland performed less well than expected in computer based problem solving. The findings suggest a lack of familiarity with using computers, at home and school, for school-related tasks, and this may have contributed to a lower performance. </p><p>  The integration of ICT into teaching and learning and assessment in schools remains a major priority for the Government. </p><p>The new Digital Strategy for Schools will address the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content, cloud services, portable computing and student devices and broadband for schools.

All schools and all school places are therefore available for children with special educational needs. In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.  Pupils with Down syndrome may receive additional teaching support in schools, either from a school's general allocation of Learning Support/ Resource Teaching, or from an allocation of additional Resource Teacher hours to the schools from the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p><p>  Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools. Many children with Down syndrome have access to such SNA support. </p><p>Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats and provision for special transport arrangements. </p><p>  Supports will continue to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs, including children with Down Syndrome starting school next September. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that the recent NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model. Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.</p></reply>

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. </p><p>Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.

The ETB through the use of co-operation hours employ tutors to work with these young people delivering tuition in Reading, Literacy, Arts and Crafts, Woodwork, Home Economics and Civic Social and Political Education. The annual grant of &euro;47,500 is provided to meet day to day running costs of the centre. </p><p>This Government is committed to addressing educational disadvantage and while services such as this centre meet a particular demand it is also important to reflect on the significant additional targeted resources which are deployed for the purpose of combating educational disadvantage and early school leaving.  These include intensive literacy and numeracy programmes, out-of-school, after school and holiday time supports as well as special needs supports provided to assist young people at risk. </p><p>It should be noted that there has been a substantial expansion of these initiatives since the establishment of this facility by the Christian Brothers in 1996.</p><p>The difficult situation in which the organisation finds itself in, arises primarily from the withdrawal of direct funding by the Christian Brothers.  The major budgetary pressures within my Department place significant constraints on its capacity to support existing programmes and, consequently, given the significant range of educational disadvantage interventions already supported by my Department, there is no scope to meet a request for addition funding for this organisation beyond the level of support currently allocated.</p></reply>

The management of their academic affairs, including admissions criteria for studying nursing, are therefore matters for the individual institutions concerned.

The assessment of means under my Department's student grant scheme is based on gross income from all sources. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point, eliminating any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions.  The means test arrangements of the student grant scheme are applied nationally.  In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.</p><p>  The eligibility of an applicant, or the level of the grant awarded, may be re-assessed by SUSI in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year. The applicant should in the first instance contact the relevant awarding body and notify them of the change in circumstances.  I have no plans at present to depart from the above practice in respect of the determination of income.  In addition, the Student Assistance Fund will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  The access offices themselves also provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</p></reply>

These are drawn from local, national, European and non-European contexts and from diverse social, cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds, so that children acquire a balanced understanding of local, Irish and international history."

The strands have been designed to ensure that children experience a broadly balanced history programme.  They reflect major historical periods, important genres of historical enquiry and particular methodological approaches.  The arrangement of material within the strands respects the professional autonomy of teachers and school principals, and has been designed to provide maximum flexibility to them in the planning of the history curriculum that they offer to children.  The number of strands, and hence the scope of historical enquiry, increases as the child gets older.  However, it is an important principle of the curriculum that at each level children should experience material from a range of historical periods and from local, national and international contexts.  It is to be expected, therefore, that many common elements of national and international history will be taught in schools, but that schools will also respond in various ways to meet the diverse needs of pupils and to ensure that the history curriculum reflects the local environment and experiences of the local community in the past. </p><p>The Teacher Guidelines that accompany the Primary History curriculum (pages 33-39) outline a broad range of sources and materials that may be used to support the teaching of history.  These guidelines make clear that &quot;carefully chosen, well-produced textbooks may be an important source for the teaching of history&quot; but also advise that &quot;textbooks, of their very nature, cannot adequately cover local history studies and should therefore be regarded as only one source among many for the teaching of history&quot; and that &quot;the exclusive use of one textbook per class could have a constricting influence on the selection of strand units&quot; by the teacher.  This guidance is in line with best international practice in the teaching of history.  The deputy should note that primary school pupils are not required to take any examinations in history.  Finally, I must state that I have no evidence to support the deputy's assertion that there are &quot;many awful and inadequate history teachers&quot;.</p></reply>

Under Section 8 of the Bill a disclosure can be made by any worker who is or was employed in a public body to a Minister of the Government on whom any function in relation to the public body is conferred or imposed any enactment.  It is my understading that while, as is currently the case, the Minister is accountable to the D&aacute;il in respect of the action taken in respect of any such disclosure, it is not proposed to adopt the approach set out in the Deputy's question in the Bill.  </p><p>  As the Deputy's question implicitly acknowledges, it is of course not practicable for all communications to my Department that could potentially relate to any form of wrongdoing to come personally to my attention.  However it is important that individuals who wish to highlight wrongdoing have a clear channel of communication to do so either to my office or officials in my Department.  In this regard, under the Protected Disclosures Bill each public body is required to put in place internal procedures for dealing with disclosures and, in addition, the Labour Relations Commission is currently preparing a statutory code of practice in relation to this area. </p></reply>

On March 24th, <b>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann</b>entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business to a consortium comprising Centrica plc, Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP and iCON Infrastructure on the basis of an enterprise value of &euro;1.1bn.  It is currently expected that this transaction will be completed within Q2 2014.  ESB announced in October 2012 that it would sell some of its non-strategic power generation assets on a phased basis, commencing in 2013.  In February 2013, ESB announced its intention to sell its 50% shareholding in each of its international tolling plants, Marchwood in the UK and Bizkaia Energia in the Basque Country, and in October it announced that it is to sell its two peat stations, West Offaly Power and Lough Ree Power.</p><p>ESB completed the disposal of its interest in Marchwood in November 2013 for a price that was in excess of expectations. Approximately &euro;153m in dividends accrued to the Exchequer in January as a result. It is expected the sale of Bizkaia Enegia will complete shortly.</p><p>In relation to the two peat stations, ESB is proposing to prospective buyers an arrangement under which it will continue to operate and maintain the stations, with existing staff.  ESB has appointed financial, legal and vendor due diligence advisors for this transaction, and I am informed that the process is likely to conclude in 2014. In regard to Coillte, the Government decided last June that it was not the appropriate time to proceed with the proposed sale of Harvesting Rights but instead the focus should be on the restructuring of Coillte, overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments. Work is proceeding to give effect to this decision. An evaluation on how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in the context of the Programme for Government commitment to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company in the bio-energy and forestry sectors is also currently being finalised.  Ryanair's 2012 bid for Aer Lingus, the subsequent investigations by the European Commission and the UK's Competition Commission and the court cases that Ryanair is currently taking, have complicated the planned disposal of the State's stake in the airline.  However, the Government remains open to the sale of this stake, when market conditions are favourable, at an acceptable price to the Government and, importantly, in circumstances that accord with Government transport policy.  Favourable conditions do not currently appear to exist for a sale of our Aer Lingus stake, and so the Government is currently focusing on managing its holding in a responsible manner in order to protect the State's interests and with the aim of maximising its value in the longer term.</p></reply>

This process began on 1 January 2014 with the standardising of State Pension age for all persons at 66 years and the cessation of the State Pension (Transition), which had previously been payable at 65 years.</p><p>  Public servants who must retire at age 65 can of course draw their public service pension at age 65. The State Pension changes have no impact on such persons where they are in the modified social insurance category.  Where alternatively they are in the full social insurance category their public service pensions (and contributions) are, as with many occupational schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits. This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension.  </p><p>  However the State Pension is, since 1 Janaury 2014, only payable from age 66 years.  In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years. This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension. This situation is not new and already applies to public servants with a retirement age below 65 years.</p><p>  I therefore have no proposals to amend the current compulsory retirement age provisions of public servants.</p></reply>

Significant protections for highly sensitive and secret information will be maintained.</p><p>  - Where a commercial state body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will now be subject to FOI.</p><p>  - The Bill extends FOI to all public bodies as a default   a reversal of the current position that a public body is included only if it is explicitly scheduled under the Bill.  This will result in a number of long-established high profile exclusions from FOI being brought under the scope of the legislation.</p><p>  - A key new initiative included in the Bill requires public bodies to prepare and furnish publication schemes consistent with international best practice in this area to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI.</p><p>  - These publication schemes will set out the nature of the information an organisation publishes on its website, which will include extensive information on its nature, role, responsibilities and activities.</p><p>  - Publication schemes are intended to lead to a proactive disclosure of significantly more information and in a more accessible form than was previously provided under the so-called section 15 and section 16 manuals.</p><p>  - The publication schemes will also provide for publication of FOI Disclosure logs which will provide information in relation to non-personal FOI requests received by the body. The idea is that as much information as possible will be made available outside of FOI.</p><p>  - The Bill also allows FOI to apply to non-public bodies that are in receipt of significant funding by the Exchequer by way of Ministerial Order.  This is expected to result in a sea-change in the potential enhanced accountability of such bodies.</p><p>  - The Bill includes a number of key principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act including the need to achieve greater openness, strengthen accountability and decision making and facilitate more effective participation by the public in consultations relating to the role, responsibilities and performance of FOI bodies.</p><p>  - It contains important extensions of the functions/powers of the Information Commissioner.</p><p>  - It also introduces a new penalty for a person convicted of the deliberate altering or destruction of records which are the subject of an FOI request.</p><p>  - There are new provisions to ensure that FOI requests relating to information held electronically are dealt with effectively.</p><p>  - A very significant measure included in the Bill confirms that there is a general right of access to records held by public bodies and in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of access.</p><p>  The FOI Bill will, therefore, once it is enacted by the Oireachtas very significantly strengthen the legal framework for FOI in Ireland. </p><p>  In tandem with the development of the FOI Bill, a review of the implementation of the FOI Acts was assisted and informed by the assessment of two expert groups; one of which comprised FOI users, academics and transparency advocates and the other comprising representatives of public bodies.  The purpose of the review was to consider the current implementation of the Act with a view to developing a Code of Practice to address existing challenges in implementing FOI; to strengthen the framework and organisational arrangements for FOI in public bodies;  to better support the implementation of FOI; to achieve greater consistency and uniformity of approach by public bodies in their processing FOI requests than is currently evidenced; to minimise the administrative burden as well as to better co-ordinate, deepen and widen the expertise and capacity of public bodies in FOI. </p><p>  The deliberations of the review groups have been completed and a draft Code has been prepared.  It is my intention to bring the draft Code to Government for approval shortly following which the draft Code will be published for consultation prior to finalisation on enactment of the FOI Bill.</p></reply>

In general, membership of an occupational public service pension scheme is a valuable feature of the overall remuneration package offered by public service employers, and is consistent with the need to ensure the adequate coverage and sustainability of pension provision across the wider working population. Accordingly, I have no plans to allow public servants to opt out of their occupational pension schemes.</p><p>  It should of course be noted that pensionable public servants, subject to Revenue and any other relevant regulatory constraints, may be able to augment their retirement income by way of AVC or PRSA arrangement, entered into at full cost to themselves with a pension provider.</p></reply>

Kevin Rafter, DCU (Chairperson), Mr. Michael Howard, recently retired Secretary General, Department of Defence, and Ms. Dorothea Dowling, Chair, Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p><p>The Deputy's question is also connected to the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Bill, 2013 which is currently being considered by the Oireachas.  Under Section 8 of the Bill a disclosure can be made by any worker who is or was employed in a public body to a Minister of the Government on whom any function in relation to the public  body is conferred or imposed any enactment.  While, as is currently the case, the Minister is accountable to the Dail in respect of the action taken in respect of any such disclosure, it is not, however, proposed to adopt the approach set out in the Deputy's question in the Bill.  </p><p>As the Deputy's question implicitly acknowledges, it is of course not practicable for all communications to my Department that could potentially relate to any form of wrongdoing to come personally to my attention.  However it is important that individuals who wish to highlight wrongdoing have a clear channel of communication to do so either to my office or officials in my Department.  In this regard, under the Protected Disclosures Bill each public body is required to put in place internal procedures for dealing with disclosures and, in addition, at my request, the Labour Relations Commission is currently preparing a statutory code of practice in relation to this area. </p></reply>

However, both the Minister for Small Business and I, have met with the banks on the issue of lending and supports available for SMEs in Ireland.  In addition, officials from this Department are on the SME Funding Consultation Committee, with representatives of the banks and relevant government organisations.  Through these engagements we continue to bring the needs of business to the attention of the banks and to press the importance of this sector to the economy.</p><p>  In order to deal with specific market failures my Department introduced two targeted schemes in 2012 to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) to positively impact on job creation, retention and sustainability.  </p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme improves access to credit for microenterprises and facilitates the growth and expansion of viable businesses with less than 10 employees from all industry sectors across the country, which have been refused access to credit from the banks. Support is in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. I will commence a review of this Scheme in Q2 2014.</p><p>  The CGS supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of an inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit. Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.  </p><p>  I have undertaken a review of the CGS and will ensure that appropriate changes are made to it in 2014 under the Action Plan for Jobs, with a view to enhancing the up-take and impact of the Scheme as soon as possible.</p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 sets out a range of commitments with regard to access to finance, including a commitment to develop new sources of finance for SMEs.  The Action Plan for Jobs commitments apply to the whole country and no special arrangements in this regard are being made for border areas.</p><p>  These new sources include crowdfunding, peer to peer lending, supply chain finance, retail minibonds and working capital for exporters.  Along with supporting the more traditional models of financing, this would support the need for a broad and diversified range of financing mechanisms.  This is in recognition of the need for a mix of instruments to address the various types of business operating in Ireland and also the various growth phases of a business.

It states that the audit exemption applies to a company for a particular financial year if the directors make a decision that the company should avail of it, and that decision is recorded in the minutes of the meeting.  Furthermore the directors must be of the opinion that the company will satisfy the size conditions set out in S.359 (6) of the Companies Bill 2012 in respect of that particular year, and (unless the particular year in question is the first financial year) the company also satisfies the conditions in respect of the preceding financial year.</p><p>  I have no plans to introduce an amendment to the Companies Bill along the lines referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Any personal injury or third party property damage claims made against my Department are managed by the State Claims Agency (SCA).</p><p>  Public Financial Procedures, Department of Finance, 2008 defines indemnities as &ldquo;agreements to compensate bodies or individuals for loss or damage arising&rdquo; and states that:    &ldquo;The general rule is that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose, would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed, and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year, so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to &lsquo;carry its own insurance&rsquo; &rdquo;. </p><p>  Similarly, in respect of vehicles owned by delegated state bodies, in compliance with Public Financial Procedures there is no commercial insurance policy in place. However a state indemnity applies.  Where a State indemnity applies, i.e. the State bears its own insurance, a commitment is made to protect against losses should any loss or damage arise where the State was negligent.  Typically a particular indemnity is enacted through an instrument of legislation. </p><p>  State indemnity for personal injury and third party property damage is set out in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000 where the management of personal injury and third party property damage claims against certain State authorities, and underlying risks, was delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA).</p><p>  Should a claim arise relating to personal injury and/or third party property damage arising from an incident involving property owned or managed by my Department this is handled by the SCA.  Should a claim arise relating to damage to a State vehicle the cost will be borne by the State body/Department. </p><p>  This relates to bodies delegated to the SCA under National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000 and subsequent orders only and not all state funded or associated enterprises.</p><p>  Finally, I have asked the Agencies of my Department to respond directly to me on this matter and I will write to the Deputy with the details, if any, in due course. </p></reply>

The Bill provides for offences and creates sanctions for breaches of Company Law only and therefore, the specific behaviour described by the Deputy is not provided for in the Bill.    However, the Bill re-enacts existing law by providing for automatic disqualification of a director for a period of five years or such other period as the court may order, where a person has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty or an offence on indictment in relation to a company.  A person who contravenes a disqualification order shall be guilty of a category 2 offence and the period of disqualification shall be extended to a further period of 10 years or as the court may order. </p><p>  The Companies Bill 2012 contains a new four-tier scheme of criminal offences in relation to company law (section 872, of the Bill as initiated). As a result of this categorisation and the introduction of uniform maximum fines and terms of imprisonment for offences, a number of existing offences will carry higher penalties under the Bill.  In the case of the category 2 offence referred to above, this carries a penalty, (a) on summary conviction, of a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p></reply>

In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s strategy, <i>&ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;</i>, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers, are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. </p><p>The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans. This year&rsquo;s Plan includes targets for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014. </p><p>In this context, South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) offers a suite of supports, comprising business information and advice, financial supports, networking, mentoring and training to start-up and existing micro-enterprises in the County.  In addition, South Dublin CEB works to promote an enterprise culture through one of the largest schools enterprise programmes in the country, covering Primary, Second Level and Third Level education.  These supports are aimed at facilitating job creation at the micro-enterprise level throughout the South Dublin County area.  Since its inception in 1993, South Dublin CEB has paid out over &euro;10m in financial support to its clients, helping to create a total of 2,830 net additional full time equivalent jobs.  In 2012 alone, 2,091 jobs were created in companies supported by the four CEBs operating in Dublin.  168 of these were created in companies based in South Dublin &ndash; including Tallaght &ndash; and supported by South Dublin CEB.  South Dublin CEB operates a number of regional enterprise support programmes in partnership with the other three CEBs in the Dublin region, details of which are available on the CEBs&rsquo; website .</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created. This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth.  The CEBs will be legally dissolved and the LEOs will come into being from 15 April 2014.  When established, the LEOs will become the first-stop-shop through which information on national and local supports for business can be accessed, where new start-up and micro-enterprises can be grant-aided, where small businesses can receive training and mentoring, and where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland activity in Tallaght and South Dublin is focussed on job creation and export growth and offers a broad range of supports to industry to support growth in jobs and exports including funding for Business Development Managers for Bolbrook, Killinarden and Bawnogue Enterprise Centres, under the CEC Funding Scheme.  In 2012, 4,097 jobs were created in Enterprise Ireland client companies based in Dublin.  Further information on supports available from Enterprise Ireland can be obtained on the Agency&rsquo;s website .</p><p>As is evidenced with IDA Ireland investment announcements over the past number of years, a significant number locate in Dublin so it is reasonable to expect that this trend will continue.  In 2012, 6,389 jobs were created in IDA-supported companies in Dublin.  In 2013, of the total number of announcements of investments made by the Agency, approximately 50% of them were for Dublin.  In 2014 to date, there have already been six company announcements for Dublin.  Typical examples of these include the announcement in January 2014 by Aspen, a global pharmaceutical company, in City West expanding its Irish operation by adding 42 new high quality jobs.</p><p>In addition, on 3 April 2014, Alexion announced plans to expand its operations in Ireland following the acquisition of a new site in West Dublin.  The company expects that this expansion will create approximately 200 new jobs as part of an investment of approximately &euro;75m over the next number of years.  There have also been announcements by four high growth start-ups for Dublin with a combined total of 102 jobs requiring a variety of skillsets. </p><p>I am confident that these announcements, together with the delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and the other initiatives outlined will have a positive impact on job creation in Tallaght and the greater Dublin area. </p></reply>

These supports are accessible to entrepreneurs who come forward with strong innovative business ideas. </p><p>When companies have reached the stage where they are investor ready, they can access Competitive Start Fund Funding which is awarded through a competitive call for applications, or Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;High Potential Start Up&rdquo; offer which provides equity investment to support the implementation of company business plans. </p><p>In addition to taking direct equity stakes in companies, the State through, Enterprise Ireland has invested heavily in stimulating and facilitating Business Angel investment through the Business Angel HALO programme and in providing access to finance for new and established enterprises through the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Schemes, the Development Capital Schemes and Innovation Fund Ireland.  Further information on supports available from Enterprise Ireland can be obtained on the Agency&rsquo;s website .</p><p>In order to deal with specific market failures, my Department introduced two targeted schemes in 2012 to support an additional flow of credit into the economy, namely the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme &ndash; for microenterprises with less than ten employees - and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) to positively impact on job creation, retention and sustainability.  Both are available to the locally traded sectors, in view of their crucial role in job creation. </p><p>The CGS, in particular, supports SMEs who, because of lack of collateral or because of an inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.  Commercially viable, well-performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, and can demonstrate their ability to repay the loan are the target of this scheme.

Horizon 2020 is a core part of Europe 2020, the Innovation Union and the European Research Area and is responding to the economic crisis by investing in future jobs and growth, addressing people&rsquo;s concerns about their livelihoods, safety and environment and strengthening the EU&rsquo;s global position in research, innovation and technology.</p><p>  Ireland is well positioned to benefit from Horizon 2020, building on an excellent performance by Irish researchers, agencies and companies in the preceding programme &ndash; the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Innovation - from which almost &euro;600 million in funding to participants in Ireland has been allocated to date.  </p><p>  In December 2013 the Government approved a national strategy for participation in Horizon 2020 together with an ambitious target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding to Ireland over the lifetime of Horizon 2020. The strategy sets out a comprehensive range of actions designed to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme and achieve the target, involving all of the key Departments, agencies and research performers. A Horizon 2020 High Level Group (HLG) under the chairmanship of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has been established to oversee the implementation of the national strategy for engagement with Horizon 2020. This includes identifying key areas of opportunity where Irish researchers, agencies and companies can maximise their participation in the programme. </p><p>  A national support network, coordinated by Enterprise Ireland, has been established, comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies, charged with helping companies and academics access the funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020. </p><p>  Horizon 2020 is implemented through 2 year work programmes. The first work programme covering the years 2014-2015 was adopted by the Commission following consultation with the relevant Programme Committees, comprising Member State delegates. The Irish delegates, comprising experts from the relevant Departments and agencies, played an active role in influencing and in finalisation of the relevant components of the 2014-2015 work programme. The strategy provides for the relevant Departments and agencies concerned to allocate the necessary resources for the implementation of the Horizon 2020 strategy and the High Level Group on Horizon 2020 will monitor Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the programme as well as implementation of the national strategy.</p></reply>

During the year a total of 13,367 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies and 164 investments won thereby exceeding the targets set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  Of the 164 investments won, 78 came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time, with 59 expansions and 27 Research, Development and Innovation projects.  R&amp;amp;D capital investment remains very strong and in 2013, IDA Ireland achieved 93% of the target of R&amp;amp;D investments.  This is a strong performance given the general market caution for large capital projects which includes significant R&amp;amp;D activities.  R,D&amp;amp;I remains significantly important to Ireland&rsquo;s FDI landscape embedding existing employment and putting in place the framework for future employment creation.  There are now over 166,000 people directly employed in IDA Ireland client companies nationwide, the highest number in the history of the agency.</p><p>  There are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.  In 2013, 177 new jobs were created in Donegal. Companies such as Pramerica and United Health (PacifiCare) which have located in County Donegal are continuously growing and recruiting.  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing base of companies in Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling/reskilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure sustainability and ongoing development. </p><p>  I am informed by IDA Ireland that in the first three months of 2014 there were 2 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to Co. Donegal.  Donegal&rsquo;s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry into high tech, high skill activity and IDA Ireland actively promotes Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  In addition to boost regional development in the area and win new business IDA Ireland has announced its intention to erect a new office facility in  Letterkenny.</p><p>  Another focus for IDA Ireland in Donegal is the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp;amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ).  The NWBTZ is aimed at promoting the linked Gateway of Letterkenny/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.  </p></reply>

In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s strategy <i>&ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;</i>, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers, are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. </p><p>The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans.  This year&rsquo;s Plan includes targets for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014. </p><p>In terms of specific initiatives in Donegal by these agencies, the Donegal County Enterprise Board (CEB) has been active in providing supports to micro-enterprises throughout the County.  In 2013, the Board approved grant aid for 29 projects, with a value of &euro;577,000 and an associated potential of 126 jobs.  The CEB also ran a range of training and management development programmes with over 870 participants, and approved access to mentoring services for over 90 businesses.  The latest figures available indicate that there are 2,434 people employed on a full-time and part-time basis in companies supported by the CEB in Co. Donegal.  Already in 2014, the Board has run the Annual Donegal Business Week with over 780 participants attending the 19 events held during the week.  The week was organised by the CEB in conjunction with Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Donegal Local Development Company, WestBic, Letterkenny IT/CoLab and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the CEB will shortly be dissolved and established as a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) within Donegal County Council, as part of the reform of the model of supports for the micro-enterprise sector.  The LEO will integrate the business support and enterprise development functions of the Council with an enhanced range of existing CEB functions, such as making it easier to obtain the full support of agencies including Revenue, Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Review Office, Skillnets and the Education and Training Boards.  This reform will result in the provision of the best possible service to people who have a business idea. </p><p>There are 165 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal employing 3,342 people on a full-time and part-time basis. Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the region and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny to build the research capabilities in the region. In addition, the Community Enterprise Centres, funded through Enterprise Ireland, are providing enterprise space to cater for micro and small enterprises throughout Donegal. Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;3.2m in 2013 for companies, entrepreneurs and Third Level institutes in Donegal and to date in 2014, the Agency has made payments of over &euro;281,000 to companies in Donegal.  </p><p>  There are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.  Donegal&rsquo;s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry into high-tech, high-skill activity and IDA Ireland promotes Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. There is no contractual relationship established between the landlord and the Department. The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.</p><p>  Discrimination on the basis of an individual&rsquo;s personal characteristics is prohibited in respect of nine specified grounds in the access to and supply of goods and services, including housing, by the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012.  These grounds are gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community. The prohibition applies to direct discrimination, whereby a person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds specified. </p><p>  However, also prohibited is indirect discrimination, where an apparently neutral provision puts a person of a specified gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless the provision is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. </p><p>  It is therefore open to a person, including a person in receipt of rent supplement, who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels that this refusal is directly linked to his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts. Information and advice in this regard is available from the Equality Authority. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.768.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800063#WRM06300"><p>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  It does this by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record.</p><p>  To be eligible for the homemakers scheme, a person must:</p><p>  - Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),</p><p>  - Be aged under 66,</p><p>  - Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56,</p><p>  - Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week,</p><p>  - Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis.</p><p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  </p><p>  However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available. </p><p>  The introduction of homemaker credits would be an alternative approach.  Instead of disregarding years outside the labour market, reducing the duration of the insurance record, and thereby increasing the average number of contributions paid per year, a homemakers credits scheme would involve the award of credits for the period(s) spent outside the labour market in a caring capacity.  A homemaker credit would improve the likelihood of qualifying and of receiving a higher rate of pension for those affected. </p><p>  However, the introduction of homemaker credits raises a number of issues, most notably cost.      If they were awarded from a current date, the cost initially would likely be low, at less than &euro;100,000 per annum, based on 2010 estimates.  Costs in relation to current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the 20% increase in female employment rates between 1994 and 2008.  </p><p>  A further factor impacting on possible costs would be the date from when such credits were effective.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million per annum.  </p><p>  Another factor is the number of possible eligible people previously employed in Ireland, who are now resident in other countries such as the UK and for which no estimates are available but which could add significantly to costs, given the general increase in female employment.   </p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change. </p><p>  The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid.   This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.  Issues such as the introduction of homemaker&rsquo;s credits will be considered in the context of this reform.</p></reply>

Prior to 2000, some individuals were allocated a specific type of PPS Number to enable computer systems in the Revenue Commissioners to &ldquo;link&rdquo; married couples for the application of marriage rate bands. Such numbers, which were linked to the PPS Number of the Assessable Spouse by adding the letter &lsquo;W&rsquo; to the end, have become known as &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers.</p><p>  Since the introduction of the individualisation of tax rate bands in 1999, new &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers are no longer allocated.  Although existing &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers are still valid PPS Numbers for the purposes of dealings with State organisations, it has been the practice of the Department to provide a replacement PPS Number to customers who might require same.  The majority of such cases have been in respect of persons requesting a new PPS Number to interact with Revenue.</p><p>  In this instance, a request was received to have the person&rsquo;s &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number replaced.  This was done on the 18th   of January 2011.  The following day, a notification letter issued to her at her home address.  Since then, a number of communications containing the new PPS Number have issued to her from the Department.</p></reply>

State pension (transition) available at 65 was abolished in January 2014, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021, and to 68 in 2028.  </p><p>The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age. Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years and State pension transition was payable for one year.</p><p>Generally, in order to qualify for a State pension transition a person had to be over the age of 65, and be retired from the workforce.  For the purposes of this pension, a person is still regarded as retired if he/she is &ndash;</p><p>- in employment that is insurable at class J PRSI, with weekly earnings of less than &euro;38.00, or </p><p>- self-employed with earnings of less than &euro;5,000 per year.</p><p>This condition ends at age of 66 with transfer to the State Pension contributory, which has no criteria related to employment status.</p></reply>

In this regard the Department has set up dedicated enquiry telephone lines and specific email addresses for each section in the Department specifically for the purpose of dealing with queries from members of the Oireachtas in relation to individual social welfare cases/claims. This also helps reduce the costs of answering pqs.  </p><p>DSP receives the highest number of Parliamentary Questions (PQs) of all Government departments.  In 2013, approximately 10,500<font color="#FF0000"> </font>PQs were tabled to the department.  Over 1900 pqs were transferred to other Government Departments leaving approximately 8,550<font color="#FF0000"> </font>actually finally tabled to DSP.  Of these approximately 4,460<font color="#FF0000"> </font>were withdrawn and 4,089 were answered.  Of the pqs answered, approximately 3,700 were written and 350 were Priority/Oral PQs.</p><p>The vast majority of PQs, some 70% of those tabled to the Department refer to the status of claims by individuals in relation to the variety of schemes administered by the Department.</p><p>A practice of withdrawing PQs has been in place for over 20 years and has assisted the Department to cope with the large volume of PQs it receives annually.  This practice is in place, generally, in relation to PQs on individual social welfare claims and not policy matters.  The Department provides the Deputy with the relevant information in relation to the individual query and in a majority of cases subsequently confirms this information in writing.  In general, Deputies find this service helpful as they are still receiving a written response to the query.</p><p>There are approximately 600 staff members of varying grades involved at some level in distributing, answering and submitting PQs for approval across the Department.  The length of time spent on dealing with PQs can vary from a few minutes to a number of hours per week. As the processing of answering PQs is undertaken as part of the normal day to day work of the individual sections within the Department it is not possible to readily isolate the costs of processing PQs from the overall administrative costs of the Department.</p><p>In 2008, a Government Department estimated that the cost of answering a PQ was approximately &euro;200 per PQ. However, there is still an amount of work involved in withdrawing a PQ i.e. contact with the Deputy and Oireachtas Questions&rsquo; Office, provision of a written response etc.  This can be quite time-consuming on both the part of the DSP staff member and the TD&rsquo;s office if telephone contact cannot be made easily either with the TD or the Oireachtas Questions Office.  Thus it is assumed that the cost of answering a written PQ is marginally more expensive than the cost of withdrawing a written PQ.  Based on the &euro;200 estimate the cost to DSP of handling the approximate 3,700 written<font color="#FF0000"> </font>PQs tabled in 2013 would be approximately &euro;740,000.  The cost of priority/oral PQs would exceed the cost of written PQs as the level of information required for the response far exceeds the information required for a written PQ but even at a cost of &euro;200 per PQ this would equate to some &euro;70,000 for 2013.</p></reply>

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS. </p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to people on the live register by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with people who are unemployed and in particular those who are, or become, long term unemployed. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. </p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location. Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, I am satisfied that alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service. In general, the frequency and staffing levels of public clinics has increased providing customers improved access to services.</p><p>  Customers are being informed of the new arrangements including details of times and days of the relocated clinics and phone contacts. If a person is unable to travel to a new clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary. </p><p>  People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly. </p><p>  The Department is continuously reviewing the staffing needs for all areas of its business, to ensure that the best possible use is made of available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society. </p></reply>

Legislation provides that non-compliance with such activation measures, without good cause, would give rise to the imposition of penalties in the form of payment reductions. </p><p>  Revised arrangements were announced as part of Budget 2014 to apply to older persons who seek the support of jobseekers schemes in advance of reaching pension age. The measures provide for these clients to sign on an annual basis while continuing to avail of Department supports on a voluntary basis should they wish to return to work, training or education. In addition, provision is made for these clients to receive their payments directly into an account in a financial institution if they so wish. </p><p>  Communication has been received by some older clients from the Department&rsquo;s Intreo/Local offices advising them of these changes. It is important to note, however, that the letter neither prevents nor discourages these clients from receiving their payments in the post office but rather it simply informs them of the option to change their payment method. </p><p>  The Department utilises a number of signing frequencies, ranging from weekly to yearly, based on operational need.  There is no correlation between payment method and frequency of signing and jobseeker clients over 62 years of age are required to sign on an annual basis regardless of whether they choose to receive their payments in the Post Office or directly into an account.  </p><p>  Statistics are not available on the total number of letters that have issued in relation to this matter as they are issued by individual Intreo Centres and Local Offices on an ongoing basis in advance of the jobseeker&rsquo;s 62nd birthday.</p></reply>

To support this, the Department developed and delivered a new case officer training programme in 2013.  This programme includes training in the Intreo process, activation measures with exercises and case studies, jobseeking supports, employer engagement, communication skills, adult guidance and IT systems training.  Training materials are continuously updated to reflect new programmes and changes to existing initiatives. Training programmes are also provided for Intreo office staff in the areas of claims decision making, customer service, non-violent crisis intervention, change management and the community welfare service. In addition, the Department funds external programmes directly related to the role of case officer including third level courses in the areas of adult guidance and career counselling currently provided by NUI Maynooth and University College Cork. </p><p>In parallel, the Department has begun, in conjunction with an external partner, a process to review and redesign its functional training programmes, focusing on the business skills required for key frontline roles in the organisation, including case officers, with a view to preparing these programmes for future accreditation.</p><p>With regard to the issue of dissatisfaction with the service provided by their existing case officer, we will facilitate a client&rsquo;s request to be reassigned to a different member of staff.   Any client is welcome to discuss issues of this nature in confidence with the Area Manager of their local Intreo Centre. In addition, the Department has a well-established, formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow clients give feedback on the quality of services they receive.  This is available on the Department&rsquo;s website: <i>.</i></p></reply>

Vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub is important as wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of both farming and biodiversity.  I have initiated a review of the current legislation to ensure that it remains both effective and balanced. As part of that review, the potential for setting the relevant dates by statutory instrument, rather than in primary legislation, as is the position currently, will be examined.</p></reply>

Relevant compensation schemes include the following:</p><p>- A comprehensive compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog habitat nominated for designation as special areas of conservation under the EU Habitats Directive. This scheme provides for annual payments of &euro;1,500, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation to a non-designated bog to continue turf cutting, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500, upon completion of a legal agreement with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>- The <i>Review of Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) </i>provides for the effective cessation of turf cutting on 36 natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017, in order to preserve their conservation value. Any turf-cutter required to cease turf cutting on one of these natural heritage areas is being offered compensatory measures similar to those available to turf-cutters from raised bog special areas of conservation. Such compensation will be available to qualifying persons with effect from 2014.</p><p>- A voluntary bog purchase scheme. Under this scheme, individuals with a legal interest in special areas of conservation or natural heritage areas could apply to sell their interest in these sites to my Department at set rates. The voluntary bog purchase scheme is closed to new applicants. </p><p>- A small-scale voluntary farm plan scheme, which supports farmers to take actions in order to benefit particular habitats and species for which special areas of conservation and special protection areas have been designated.  Due to budgetary constraints, the scheme has been curtailed but existing contracts are being honoured.</p><p>While my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, significant funding is also provided through the rural development programme, operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which provides for a range of supports for farmers, including payments in respect of sites nominated for designation under the Directives.</p><p>The amount of compensation paid under the various schemes operated by my own Department from 2010 to 2013 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Farm Plan Scheme</th><th>Commercial Turf Cutting</th><th>Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme</th><th>Interim Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme</th><th>Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;4,119,349</td><td>&euro;886,233</td><td>&euro;865,110</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;5,262,587</td><td>&euro;3,450,038</td><td>&euro;405,766</td><td>&euro;6,000</td><td>&euro;51,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;4,507,248</td><td>&euro;150,000</td><td>&euro;422,701</td><td>Nil</td><td>&euro;3,175,500</td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>&euro;3,750,420</td><td>Nil</td><td>&euro;760,870</td><td>Nil</td><td>&euro;3,093,698</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In short, turf cutting may not be undertaken on this bog without explicit consent. If sought, it is unlikely that consent could be given due to the likely damage it would cause to the protected habitat on the bog. Affected turf-cutters can avail of the compensation and relocation schemes that have been made available.

I am aware that recent legislative changes in the United Kingdom have provided new arrangements for public access to the archival records of government after 20 years and not 30 years as had previously been the case.  I am cognisant that the difference in regimes between the UK and Ireland could lead to records on common matters being released earlier in the UK and Northern Ireland.  An Interdepartmental Working Group comprising officials from my Department and the Departments of An Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality, the Office of the Attorney General and the National Archives has been established to examine the issues surrounding a potential change in the 30 year legislation.

Both are protected under the EU Habitats Directive. Ireland is obliged to monitor their populations and report on their status every six years.  The most recent report submitted to the European Commission in June 2013 is available on the website .  Management of seal populations will require careful consideration of recently published studies from Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute concerning seal depredation (fish eaten by seals during fisheries operations) and bycatch of seals in set nets.  I understand further work is underway to enhance our understanding of this complex area.  The assessment of risk from inshore sea fisheries in relation to the Natura 2000 network by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Marine Institute later in 2014 will also need to carefully consider seal-fisheries interactions. All these studies will continue to inform policy in relation to seal protection.</p><p>While seals are protected under the Wildlife Acts, licences may be sought under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to scare or kill seals where damage is being caused.  Licences are issued most usually if a specific seal is known to be a problem in a specific place. </p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Meath can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.  The State can only become involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  5 Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are providing services to licenced telecommunications operators in the towns of Dunboyne, Clonee, Dunshauglin, Kells, Trim and Navan on an open-access basis.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a total of 36 locations in County Meath before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss these further with the Deputy.</p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.</p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.</p><p>  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by measures in the National Digital Strategy which I launched in July last.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy targets specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital engagement of citizens and businesses to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Kerry can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 33 locations in County Kerry, including Beaufort before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.  I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing good quality broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.</p><p>During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the rollout of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services.</p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br /><br />- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</blockquote>In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.</p><p>Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, this map will outline exactly the type of broadband is available in County Kerry.</p><p>The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

This issue co-exists, however, with the public health and safety aspects, environmental conditions and industrial heritage preservation in the area.  It is essential that an appropriate balance be struck in dealing with the various matters.  In the first instance funding of &euro;3 million is being made available to identify and undertake essential public health and safety works over the three year period 2014 to 2016.  It is intended that the programme of works identified will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the making safe of hazards arising from adits, shafts, and unstable spoil heaps, and provision of further fencing and signage.  These works will address public health and safety concerns and deal with certain environmental risks.  While it is not possible to develop a tourist walkway at the Avoca mine site in the current remediation programme, work will be undertaken in a manner that allows for such an initiative to be integrated into future developments, if resources become available.</p></reply>

The potential for investment, jobs and growth are among the matters under consideration.  Ireland and the UK have made good progress on both States&rsquo; joint, innovative and ambitious work in the area of renewable energy trading since my signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey M.P. in January 2013.  However, it is recognised that the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and the key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, would make 2020 delivery very difficult to achieve given project lead times.  For this reason, the shared work will focus on the longer term post 2020 period, and both countries will continue to work together on that basis. The cost benefit analysis is a key element of the work and remains confidential at this stage.</p></reply>

This year t he estab lishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisa tional and financial challenges.  Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.  In this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority for 2014.  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and, therefore, a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.</p><p>Under section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, a local authority may, as a reserved function, and subject to any Regulations made under the section, resolve to vary the rate of the Local Property Tax (LPT) within its functional area by a maximum of +/- 15%.  This power will be available to local authorities effective from 2015, as the relevant sections of the Act will come into operation on 1 July 2014 . The inclusion of this local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities. The Revenue Commissioners must be notified no later than 30 September 2014 of the details of any decision made in respect o f the l ocal adjustment factor for 2015 and I understand that Revenue reminded local authorities of this requirement recently. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners released details of the levels of LPT collected in local authority areas in 2013 earlier this year, which should provide a useful information source for local authorities; it is available at .</p><p>The changes being made to the current local government funding model, are significant and it is essential that the impacts are fully assessed and that the effect on overall Exchequer funding is managed appropriately. My Department will continue to engage with all relevant Departments and Agencies in this regard.  There will be changes to the 2015 budget process for local authorities arising from EU obligations, which will require local authorities to prepare draft budget strategies by the end of September 2014.  My Department will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that they have an appropriate level of information, including in relation to LPT retention, to facilitate this deadline being achieved.</p></reply>

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded construction programmes.  Earlier this year, I signalled a return to modest levels of new social housing construction with an announcement of 1,000 new housing starts over the 2014-2015 period.  Notwithstanding this, the Government acknowledges the need to respond more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms.  To maximise the social gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social gain from private developments.  Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisition and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587 million, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.  This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.</p><p>  Last month I announced the approval of some 56 social housing construction projects with an overall value of some &euro;68 million under the Local Authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015.  This new construction programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list.  Projects were selected for approval on the basis of the proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities, the relative priority afforded to each of these projects and the overall level of housing need locally.  On Budget Day 2014, I announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing some 400 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use.  My Department is currently assessing the proposals recently received from local authorities under this programme and I will announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible.  I also intend to announce details shortly of the allocations to local authorities under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of need over the 2014-2015 period.  Some &euro;35 million is being set aside for this programme which is intended to deliver in the region of 230 new homes.</p><p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and AHBs towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  AHBs will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing, particularly having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment.  It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available, including potentially social housing bonds and social impact bonds.</p></reply>

Hard water and the minerals associated with hard water are not included as parameters in the quality standards specified in the Regulations as they do not pose as a threat to human health.

The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 do not require the use of builders who are registered with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF). Owners however have a duty of care to appoint competent persons to work on site and it is in this context that reliance on industry registers may be of assistance to them. The CIF is in the process of setting up a voluntary register known as the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) and the Government is committed to placing this register on a statutory footing in 2015. While no legislative proposals for the statutory register have been devised as yet, it is not intended that any such proposals would confine or restrict either self-build or one-off housing.</p><p>  Galway County Council were correct to indicate, when asked, that the wording of the certificates may not be varied or amended by any signatory as the certificates are prescribed forms. However, the Regulations place no restriction on self-build but an owner who undertakes to act as builder should be satisfied that they are competent to do so. A building control authority has no role in approving or rejecting the assignment, which, as indicated, is the responsibility of the owner. I understand that, Galway County Council has now responded definitively to the persons concerned along the lines outlined above</p></reply>

From 1 July 2014 , the requirements of the Construction Products Regulation will apply to steel fabricators covered by I.S. EN 1090-1:2009.</p><p>A European Harmonised Standard for steel - <i>EN 1090-1:2009 Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures - Part 1: Requirements for conformity assessment of structural components</i>was approved by the Comit&eacute; Europ&eacute;en de Normalisation (CEN &ndash; the European Committee for Standardi s ation) on 15 June 2008 and was first published on 1 July 2009. The standard was subsequently published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland on 9 September 2009. The standard's applicability date as a harmonised European standard was 1 January 2011 as agreed by the European Commission in consultation with Member States.  Subsequently, the European Commission extended the standard's applicability date as it recognised that there were a large number of small steelwork fabricators who would benefit from the extra time. It was anticipated that the sector needed a little more time to adapt and prepare, and agreed on 1 July 2014 as the date of the end of the co-existence period. Accordingly, with the co-existence period coming to an end, CE marking will be mandatory for fabricated structural steelwork in accordance with I.S.

My Department does not hold information on the number of households in RAS at any given time. Numbers in RAS constantly vary as contracts end, tenants move on to other properties, landlords withdraw from the scheme, new tenancies are allocated or vacancies in contracted units are filled.  The amount of rent paid through RAS is a matter for individual authorities, having regard to the need to obtain value for money.  Since the inception of the Rental Accommodation Scheme in 2004, expenditure up to the end of 2013 has totalled &euro;643.2 million.

Recoupment made to local authorities under the RAS covers not only the contracted rents due to private landlords but also payments that are made to Approved Housing Bodies, administration costs, deposits on newly acquired accommodation, payments made in respect of additional units supplied under the Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 and up to very recently payments in respect of homeless persons.  My Department does not hold data on the amount directly paid by local authorities to private landlords in rents nor does it have access to the amounts concerned by each local authority area.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the metering programme. </p><p>  While it is a matter for Irish Water to comply with all national and European legislation in the discharge of its functions, the company has confirmed to my Department that it is satisfied that the selection and fitting of the boundary water meter boxes fully complies with international standards. For a Grade B cover and frame, the metering project tender documents for supply of boundary boxes set out the required conformance in relation to both loading classification and loading tests. The essential requirement was compliance with Grade B test loading for Grade B tendered boxes. Grade B boundary boxes are used where deemed necessary by Irish Water designers. They are fitted in accordance with the boundary box manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations and procedures which Irish Water designers have also incorporated into their designs. Furthermore, Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that the four main framework contractors have IS EN ISO 9001:2008 certification.   </p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The maximum allowable value for lead is 10 microgrammes per litre.  There is no requirement to replace lead pipes as part of a European Union scheme. However, as part of the metering programme, Irish Water will be identifying the location of any lead service connections during the installation programme.</p></reply>

With this in mind and having regard to the latest developments in the applicable standards since 1997, a broadly representative working group was established by my Department in mid-2011 to undertake a comprehensive review of Part J/TGDJ .     Over the course of the review, my Department, in conjunction with other relevant public bodies, were satisfied that concerns previously held over sensor reliability and the lack of any end-of-life indicators in carbon monoxide detectors had been addressed by recent developments within the industry.</p><p>From the evidence of carbon monoxide incidents in the UK and abroad, the majority appear to occur with solid fuel appliances, with gas and oil being the safest. Open flue or flueless appliances, because they take the combustion air from a room, have a potentially greater risk than a balanced flue scenario. In addition, Part L of my Department&rsquo;s Building Regulations 1997, which deals with the c onservation of fuel and energy, has required all new and replacement boilers in dwellings to have an efficiency of 86% since 31 March 2008 and an efficiency of 90% since 1 December 2011. This promotes the installation of room sealed boilers, which have a lower risk of the escape of carbon monoxide due to balanced flues.</p><p>Against this background, I have recently signed the Building Regulations (Part J <i></i>Amendment) Regulations 2014 and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document J &ndash; Heat Producing Appliances</i>(2014) which include new requirements in relation to the detection and warning of carbon monoxide in new dwellings , and in existing dwellings where the replacement of certain heat producing appliances is proposed. These regulations come into force on 1 September 2014.   </p><p>Under the new regulations, provision is made for the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in - </p><p>-  new dwellings where open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed, </p><p>-  existing dwellings where replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed, </p><p>-  habitable rooms where a system chimney attached to a heat producing appliance passes within or over such rooms.   </p><p>While the new regulations will give added protection to new dwelling owners, and to the owners of existing dwellings when heat producing appliances are being replaced, it is important to note that the key actions required to prevent carbon monoxide incidences are and continue to be: -</p><p>(1) the proper installation and commissioning of heat producing appliances and flues/chimneys, </p><p>(2) ensuring proper air supply is maintained to combustion devices, and </p><p>(3) the proper maintenance and inspection of combustion appliances on a regular basis.   </p><p>Notwithstanding the new regulations, the regular and continued provision of information to raise awareness of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide in homes will need to be maintained by the relevant authorities.</p></reply>

The title of Chartered Engineer is also protected by separate legislation. Registration of title is necessary in order to protect consumers from unqualified persons passing themselves off as construction professionals. This is now less likely to occur as statutory certificates required for building control purposes must now be given by registered professionals, following the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which came into effect on 1 March 2014. </p><p>  Architects, Building Surveyors and Chartered Engineers are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in the regulations is entirely appropriate.</p><p>  It is important to note that inclusion on the statutory registers is not confined or restricted to members of the professional bodies who have been recognised in law as the registration body. Although the profession of Architectural Technologist is an unregulated profession in Ireland any such person, who possesses the requisite competence in the design of construction works, may seek inclusion on the statutory registers. It is understood that a number of Chartered Architectural Technologists have succeeded in becoming registered as Architects and/or Building Surveyors. Inclusion on either of these registers enables a person to sign statutory certificates of compliance as provided for under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p><p>  Neither I nor my Department has any role in the assessment, evaluation or validation of competence of construction professionals. This is a matter for the professional bodies who have been designated as the relevant competent authorities for the purposes of EU and n ational law, namely Engineers Ireland (EI) in respect of the Engineering profession, the Royal Institut e of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) in respect of the a   rchitectural profession and the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland (SCSI) in respect of the surveying professions. </p><p>  Architectural Technologists who consider they possess the requisite competence in the design of construction works should be advised to contact EI, RIAI and SCSI in order to identify the route to registration most suited to their own individual circumstances. </p></reply>

The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014. Water charges will not commence until 1 October 2014 and the first bills will be issued by Irish Water to households from January 2015. </p><p>Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will now become customers of Irish Water, having previously been customers of the relevant local authority.

Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i></i>The co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.   </p><p>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 also provides for the transfer of water services functions from the 34 water services authorities to Irish Water.

In October 2013 , the Government approved initial funding of &euro;10 million for the implementation of the scheme in 2014. Further funding will be provided over the next two years following consultation with the nister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of a further capital stimulus package.</p><p>  At this point in time, it is not possible to look beyond the figure of 1,000 dwellings which may be in need of repair. However, there are a number of positive indications, including the number of applications received by the Pyrite Resolution Board to date , which suggest the number of dwellings requiring remediation is in line with this estimated figure.</p><p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board commenced accepting applications from eligible homeowners for inclusion in the pyrite remediation scheme on 26 February 2014. I understand that the Board has received just over 400 completed applications at this stage and these are currently being processed. While the Board is keen to ensure that there will be no undue delay in the validation, assessment and verification processes, it is inevitable that it will take some time to undertake the processing of the applications currently on hand and those that will be submitted over the period ahead . The Board is committed to moving as quickly as possible to the works phase of the remediation process and I understand that it is their intention that this phase will commence in the second half of the year .   </p></reply>

The number and level of staff and the time spent on preparing responses to individual Parliamentary Questions, and the associated cost, depends on a range of factors, including the complexity of the issue raised and the extent to which the information involved is readily available in my Department. Undoubtedly, a considerable amount of time is required to answer the significant number of questions tabled to me by Deputies. However , it is not possible to readily quantify the cost involved for the reasons outlined above and, as the processing of individual Parliamentary Questions is undertaken as part of the normal day to day work of individual Business Units within my Department, it would be unnecessarily burdensome to endeavour to iso late the administrative costs from the overall administrative costs of my Department. </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and related services rests with housing authorities. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. My Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. Housing authorities provide additional funding from their own resources. </p><p>The total Section 10 funding provided by my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis for the years 2009 to 2013 , the component of that funding which was for domestic violence refuges, are set out in the tables below. The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.</p><p>Under the funding arrangements, responsibility for rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision making in relation to proposals for funding of particular services within the current budgetary allocation rests with the homelessness statutory Management Group of the respective region. My Department has no function in regard to decisions on operational matters which, in the case of the Dundalk women&rsquo;s Refuge, are a matter for the North East Homelessness Management Group, with Louth County Council as the lead authority.</p><p>I recently notified housing authorities of provisional regional homelessness allocations for 2014 and these will be formalised when the protocol for the delegation of Section 10 homeless funding has been agreed between my Department and the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions. In notifying housing authorities, I sought to encourage them to target their homelessness spending on certain categories of expenditure and indicative national targets were identified to guide authorities in framing their homeless budgets. A national expenditure target of 4.4% (or &euro;2.2 million) was identified for domestic violence refuges in 2014.</p><p>The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me. The report, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <font color="#1F497D">, </font>recommended that existing funding arrangements for the provision of domestic violence refuge accommodation and services should be transferred to the new Child and Family Agency; this will be considered in the context of my Departments wider engagement with the Agency in relation to the report&rsquo;s recommendations. A Homelessness Policy Implementation Team is tasked with implementing the Homelessness Oversight Group's First Report and it will report on this plan to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy later this month and quarterly thereafter.   </p><p><b>Funding p</b><b>rovided under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988</b><table><tr><th>Region </th><th><div>2009 </div></th><th><div>2010 </div></th><th><div>2011 </div></th><th><div>2012 </div></th><th><div>2013 </div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td><div>&euro;38,967,542 </div></td><td><div>&euro;40,521,375 </div></td><td><div>&euro;35,732,525 </div></td><td><div>&euro;32,398,290 </div></td><td><div>&euro;31,322,223 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South East </td><td><div>&euro;1,945,792 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,742,886 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,110,476 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,848,877 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,787,469 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North East </td><td><div>&euro;1,197,451 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,037,617 </div></td><td><div>&euro;912,250 </div></td><td><div>&euro;910,194 </div></td><td><div>&euro;879,963 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands </td><td><div>&euro;872,375 </div></td><td><div>&euro;666,344 </div></td><td><div>&euro;624,897 </div></td><td><div>&euro;672,027 </div></td><td><div>&euro;649,707 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South West </td><td><div>&euro;5,458,211 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,270,143 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,505,749 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,418,967 </div></td><td><div>&euro;4,272,197 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West </td><td><div>&euro;4,110,166 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,435,607 </div></td><td><div>&euro;2,905,457 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,516,119 </div></td><td><div>&euro;3,399,336 </div></td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td><div>&euro;2,175,312 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,699,288 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,227,696 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,581,478 </div></td><td><div>&euro;1,528,951 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid East </td><td><div>&euro;885,801 </div></td><td><div>&euro;906,842 </div></td><td><div>&euro;697,665 </div></td><td><div>&euro;839,146 </div></td><td><div>&euro;811,275 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North West </td><td><div>&euro;444,206 </div></td><td><div>&euro;423,355 </div></td><td><div>&euro;406,335 </div></td><td><div>&euro;360,865 </div></td><td><div>&euro;348,879 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>&euro;56,056,856 </div></td><td><div>&euro;54,703,457 </div></td><td><div>&euro;48,123,050 </div></td><td><div>&euro;46,545,963 </div></td><td><div>&euro;45,000,000 </div></td></tr></table></p><p><b>Funding provided under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 in respect of domestic violence refuges</b><table><tr><th><div>Region </div></th><th><div>2009 <br /><br />&euro; </div></th><th><div>2010 <br /><br />&euro; </div></th><th><div>2011 <br /><br />&euro; </div></th><th><div>2012 <br /><br />&euro; </div></th><th><div>2013 <br /><br />&euro; </div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td><div>332,080 </div></td><td><div>567,447 </div></td><td><div>519,402 </div></td><td><div>524,975 </div></td><td><div>753,305 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid East </td><td><div>92,710 </div></td><td><div>92,710 </div></td><td><div>92,710 </div></td><td><div>85,598 </div></td><td><div>94,710 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands </td><td><div>175,404 </div></td><td><div>49,008 </div></td><td><div>49,008 </div></td><td><div>49,008 </div></td><td><div>46,093 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West </td><td><div>571,657 </div></td><td><div>507,609 </div></td><td><div>443,561 </div></td><td><div>507,609 </div></td><td><div>509,193 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North East </td><td><div>155,746 </div></td><td><div>126,721 </div></td><td><div>140,000 </div></td><td><div>188,000 </div></td><td><div>12,900 </div></td></tr><tr><td>North West </td><td><div>23,853 </div></td><td><div>23,853 </div></td><td><div>23,853 </div></td><td><div>23,853 </div></td><td><div>41,369 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South East </td><td><div>434,304 </div></td><td><div>415,542 </div></td><td><div>462,289 </div></td><td><div>406,371 </div></td><td><div>401,991 </div></td></tr><tr><td>South West </td><td><div>249,635 </div></td><td><div>240,864 </div></td><td><div>214,303 </div></td><td><div>237,242 </div></td><td><div>228,083 </div></td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td><div>153,950 </div></td><td><div>134,116 </div></td><td><div>106,837 </div></td><td><div>134,116 </div></td><td><div>152,691 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td><div>2,189,339 </div></td><td><div>2,157,870 </div></td><td><div>2,051,963 </div></td><td><div>2,156,772 </div></td><td><div>2,240,335 </div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The new Building Control Management System (BCMS) is an online system which facilitates the electronic administration of building control functions. As such it will greatly benefit building control authorities and owners, builders and construction professionals in discharging their separate and distinct responsibilities under the Building Control Act 1990 and the regulations made thereunder. The BCMS does not alter in any way the discharge of the legal powers vested in each local building control authority who will continue to be independently responsible for the oversight and enforcement of building control requirements in their own administrative area.</p><p>The BCMS, developed by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) with the assistance of external consultants, came into operation on 1 March 2014 in line with the commencement of the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which support its deployment as the preferred means of administration on building control matters. The system will provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector.  In addition, it will facilitate the risk analysis of all projects for which commencement notices are received, which will inform each building control authority's own inspection arrangements thus ensuring that available inspection resources are used to optimum effect. </p><p>As such, the BCMS is part of a wide ranging set of local government reform measures being delivered in line with the  <i><i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i></i><i>(October 2012)</i>and the Local Government Reform Act 2014.</p><p>My Department is not directly responsible for the development of the BCMS which has been undertaken by the LGMA, with external support provided by Providence CRM Ltd. and Annertech Ltd. I understand that the engagement of these supports was advertised on the Government e-tenders website and was in accordance with national public procurement policy guidelines as published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>The initial phase of development concentrated on facilitating the receipt and lodgement of commencement notices, statutory certificates and compliance documentation in line with the Regulations and went live on 1 March 2014. Development will continue in order to enhance capability to address, among other things, inspection and enforcement activities, risk analysis of construction projects and management reporting requirements. This work is on schedule to be delivered by September 2014. Development costs are anticipated to be of the order of &euro;200,000. My Department has provided funding of &euro;50,000 in 2 013 and has committed to providing an equivalent amount in the current year, with the remainder being recouped by the LGMA from individual local authorities.</p></reply>

Several other jurisdictions address the matter of restrictions of particular breeds of dogs in a similar way to Ireland; for example, England, Northern Ireland, France and New Zealand all have similar restrictions on specific breeds of dogs.</p><p>  I have always emphasised that responsible dog ownership is key to a productive relationship between dogs, dog owners and the general public. Individual dog owners must recognise and accept their responsibilities for ensuring that their dogs are controlled at all times and do not cause harm to people or other animals. This position is enshrined in our legislation, as are the penalties for non-conformance and the statutory responsibility of local authorities for enforcement. Local authority dog control staff work on enforcement of this legislation on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Other factors, such as upward only rent reviews, parking charges, rising energy costs and on-line trading, have also undermined the viability of small and medium-sized businesses in the retail sector, threatening the fabric of our urban centres.</p><p>To help address this issue, a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department in recent years, as follows:</p><p>-  local authorities were requested to exercise restraint, or where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses in the current economic climate &ndash; the vast majority of local authorities have responded positively to this request,</p><p>-  revised development contribution guidelines were introduced last year requesting planning authorities to put in place reduced development contributions to support town centre development and incentivise activity in the areas prioritised for development in the relevant core strategy,</p><p>-  the publication of new guidelines on retail planning last year aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres. These guidelines retained the previous caps on store size in less populated and smaller towns, and were aimed at striking the right balance to ensure that local monopolies are not created in smaller towns which would be detrimental to competition. </p><p>In terms of Government action other than by my Department in providing assistance to retail businesses and stimulating economic activity in local communities, a number of measures have been introduced since 2011, including &ndash; </p><p>-  the introduction of a 9% rate of VAT on certain goods and services,</p><p>-  the halving of the lower rate of employers&rsquo; PRSI,</p><p>-  the introduction of the microenterprise Loan Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of which have had take-up from the retail sector, and</p><p>-  the extension of seed capital and the employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector.</p><p>My Department remains committed to working with other Government Departments, with local government and with other community development and enterprise stakeholders with a view to providing a clear framework for addressing urban centre decline and its impacts on the retail sector, and will continue to explore all options for further action in this regard.  </p></reply>

In compiling the report, the EPA has consulted with the Health Services Executive who provided information and advice with regard to the human health impacts related to the fire.</p><p>  The assessment is based on data available from a number of fixed sites in Dublin which form part of the national network of air quality monitoring stations, and measurements of air quality collected in close proximity to the fire using portable monitoring equipment operated by EPA personnel. </p><p>  The ambient air quality monitoring data indicates that the fire had no significant impact on air quality across the greater Dublin area. As anticipated, the level of pollutants in the smoke plume in close proximity to the fire were elevated in a number of cases and indicate the potential for short-term effects such as discomfort for exposed individuals. However, those following the health advice which issued at the time of the incident are unlikely to have experienced these levels for any significant period of time. </p><p>  Overall, the results of the air quality monitoring indicate that the air quality impact of the fire was localised and transient and there was no significant potential for any long-term health impacts as a result of this incident. The report will be made available through the EPA website this week. The EPA is continuing its investigations into the incident from a licence compliance perspective, after which further enforcement action may be considered. The priority for the EPA is to ensure that the necessary management practices are in place to eliminate the causes of this type of incident and to protect human health and the environment. </p><p>  The investigation of the fire by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Garda authorities. A report prepared by Dublin Fire Brigade on the incident has been sent to my Department for information. While the report will be considered in the context of any procedural or operational policy initiatives which may mitigate this sector&rsquo;s particular fire risks, the question of publication of the report is a matter for the Dublin Fire Brigade in the first instance.  </p></reply>

The Plan was drawn up to best international standards and underpins the risk-based inspection of septic tanks and other on-site treatment systems. The inspection system is consistent with the necessity to ensure compliance with the provisions of the EU Waste Directive and the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009 and also has regard to the European Parliament and Council&rsquo;s recommendations of 4th April 2001 regarding the minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States (2001/331/EC).</p><p>  When preparing the Plan, the EPA developed a specifically designed method to rank areas of the country by reference to the risk s posed by domestic waste water treatment systems to both human health and the environment. The risk-based methodology, which has regard to factors such as densities of individual treatment systems across the numerous hydrological and geological settings in Ireland and the locations of sensitive groundwater or surface water receptors, is used as the basis for the selection of particular sites for risk-based inspections by the water services authorities.</p><p>  Inspections are objective and evidence-based and aimed at identifying on-site systems which pose a risk to human health or the environment. The EPA&rsquo;s Plan includes details of the minimum number of inspections (per county) to be carried out in its first year of implementation. The EPA will undertake a full review of the Plan following completion of its first cycle on 30 June 2014.Decisions regarding the number of inspections to be carried out annually are a matter for the EPA and will be proportionate to the risk s posed to human health and the environment.</p></reply>

A number of bodies in this jurisdiction, e.g. the Office of the Inspector of Prisons, already have responsibility for inspecting places where persons are deprived of their liberty.</p><p>  It is expected that the General Scheme of the Places of Detention Bill will be completed later this year. Subject to Government approval of my legislative proposals, I intend to publish the General Scheme with a view to facilitating a public consultation process in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the Convention, &quot;enforced disappearance&quot; is considered to be &quot;the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law&quot;.</p><p>Article 40.4.1 of the Constitution provides that no citizen shall be deprived of their liberty save in accordance with law.</p><p>Ratification of the Convention requires domestic legislation.</p><p>Section 15 of the Non Fatal Offences against the Person Act provides for an offence of false imprisonment which addresses circumstances where a person is taken or detained, or whose personal liberty is restricted by another person without the consent of the person involved. A person guilty of false imprisonment is liable or on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for up to life.</p><p>Consent is deemed to be absent where the person responsible obtains the other's consent by force or threat of force, or by deception causing the other to believe that he or she is under legal compulsion to consent.</p><p>The Act also provides for a child abduction offence.</p><p>Ireland is committed to ratification of the Convention as soon as competing legislative priorities permit.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by them, including the amendment of domestic law as necessary.</p><p>  An interdepartmental committee on the Convention is monitoring the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification. As part of its work programme, the committee has identified issues to be considered by various Departments. It is a matter for these Departments to determine whether any actions are required to address the issues in advance of ratification and report back to the committee. This work is ongoing in all Departments.  At the request of the committee, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, is also assisting in assessing remaining requirements for ratification to ensure that all outstanding issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>  For my Department one of the key requirements is the enactment of capacity legislation. The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a Bill in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, published on 17 July 2013, provides a series of options to support people with impaired capacity to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the UN Convention. It undertakes a comprehensive reform of existing legislation governing capacity. The Bill will go to Committee Stage shortly. The enactment of this legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed to enable ratification by the State of the UN Convention.</p></reply>

The report made a range of recommendations concerning the investigation of child sexual abuse with a view to addressing past failings and better protecting children in the future.  While the inspection was under way An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued a comprehensive policy on the investigation of sexual crime, crimes against children and child welfare.  This had the effect that many of the Inspectorate recommendations had already been incorporated into Garda practice.  At the time of the report's publication, I also published detailed material on the steps being taken to address its recommendations and to improve child protection generally.</p><p>  Since then An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued to implement the report's recommendations and to give effect to the new Garda policy in this field.  With a view to taking stock of that progress, on 28 August 2013 I issued a request that the Inspectorate carry out a follow-up review of its Report, in accordance with section 117 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. That review is ongoing. </p><p>  In light of this, I have no plans, at this time, to initiate a parallel review of these matters, including by making a request under section 106 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p></reply>

In preparing that plan, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. </p><p>  The Commissioner determined as a result of that review that a number of Garda stations should be closed and concluded that the communities covered by the areas in question could be better served by having Garda&iacute; patrolling the areas rather than being confined to a specific premises. The revised structures continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's community policing philosophy.</p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Cabinteely Sub Districts now provide the policing service to the  Kill O'The Grange area.

If the person was under 18 at that time, then in accordance with the provisions of section 258 of the Children Act 2001, such offences would not be disclosed once a period of three years has elapsed since the date of the offence, provided that the person has complied with any order of the Court.</p><p>  Separately, elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions of persons over 18 are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013]. The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.  I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in the autumn of 2014.</p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children &amp;amp; Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 sets out procedures to allow the disclosure of criminal records and specified information for vetting purposes. &ldquo;Specified information&rdquo; is information other than a court determined criminal record. For example, &ldquo;specified information&rdquo; would include cases where, in accordance with the provisions of the Probation Act 1907 the Courts find that a case against an adult person has been proved, but the person is given probation instead of a criminal conviction.  The procedures set out in the Act are designed to ensure that the human rights of the person being vetted are adequately protected. It is important to note that before specified information can be disclosed, the person who is the subject of the information must be given a copy of that information and must be given the opportunity to challenge the proposed disclosure. The Act also provides that a disclosure of such information will only occur where there is a bona fide concern that the person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons, and the information has been assessed for its reliability and relevance, and the disclosure is in accordance with principles of natural justice.   In the meantime, the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable persons continues to be done on a non-statutory basis. </p><p>  Pending commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 the revisions in approach outlined above will, in the interim be applied on an administrative basis by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.   Until now all records of all criminal convictions have been disclosed by the Garda&iacute; when vetting people for various employments. However, in future certain minor offences that are more than seven years old, where the person has not subsequently reoffended, will not be disclosed. In addition, cases of minor offences where charges are struck out will not be disclosed. Minor motoring or public order offences which are more than seven years old will not be disclosed in any case. Instances where the District Court has applied the Probation Act will not be disclosed unless the offence in question is a sexual offence or an offence against the person. </p><p>  More serious offences, such as all sexual offences, offences against the person, serious motoring offences, firearms offences, robbery, or any offence for which the person is convicted on indictment will continue to be disclosed in all cases.</p></reply>

OMCs, the membership of which comprise the owners of residential units within the development, are established for the purposes of management of such common areas. </p><p>  Section 18 of the 2011 Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. These service charges must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC. </p><p>  Through their membership of the OMC, residential unit owners have the right and duty to set and approve appropriate annual service charges and contributions to the sinking fund. It would not therefore be appropriate to impose restrictions or introduce limits in respect of such matters. I would however encourage all residential unit owners to attend and participate actively in the annual general meeting at which decisions in respect of these matters are reached. </p></reply>

This appointment is an important step towards our goal of establishing the new Charities Regulatory Authority within 2014.  The Charities Act gives us the framework we need to increase transparency and accountability across the charities sector and to support the good practice that is essential to a strong and vibrant charities sector.  We can now move forward with establishing the Office of the Authority and putting its Board in place over the coming weeks, so that it can begin operation later in the year in line with the commitment made by the Government.</p><p>  An early priority for the new Authority will be the preparation and publication of a statutory register of charities. All registered charities will be required to provide reports to the Authority each year on their activities and these reports will be made available to the public. This will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, and will support the good practice in charity governance and management that is critical to a vibrant charity sector that commands the trust and confidence of donors and beneficiaries alike.</p></reply>

In summary, the arrangement will be a form of mutual recognition of each jurisdiction&rsquo;s visas rather than a new form of visa.  This mutual recognition will allow for entry and free movement around the CTA, including between Ireland and Northern Ireland, on the basis of a single visa.

Methods for enhancing and developing processes for the identification of victims will be examined through these consultative structures having regard to the reports on Ireland by two international organisations [OSCE and the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA)] with expertise in the area of human trafficking  and will be addressed in the context of the 2nd National Action Plan.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Amendment Act 2013 which came into effect in August of last year expanded the definition of human trafficking in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 to include<i>inter alia</i>trafficking for the purposes of forced illegal activities for commercial gain. Trafficking for forced labour in cannabis production could come within this expanded definition. The 2013 Act, for the purpose of clarity, also defined forced labour, with some stated exceptions, <i>as a work or service which is exacted from a person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself or herself voluntarily.</i></p><p>I am aware that the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland have articulated their views on this matter in a number of fora. I am of the view that, at this time, it would be helpful for the Migrants Rights Centre to have discussions with other stake-holders within the consultative structures chaired by the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department, particularly within the Labour Exploitation and National Referral Working Groups. These Working Groups provide a forum where issues arising out of the implementation of the expanded definition of human trafficking for forced participation in criminal activities such as cannabis cultivation can be examined and discussed at a practical level.</p><p>Migrants Rights Centre Ireland participates in an intensive three day training course entitled &ldquo;Trafficking in Human Beings; Prevention, Protection, Partnership and Prosecution&rdquo; undertaken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Almost 700 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have now received this training.  The overriding aim of the training is to provide members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with knowledge of indicators of all the forms of human trafficking, where to look and how to identify victims of human trafficking. Recently, the training programme has included a module addressing the potential link between human trafficking and cannabis grow houses emphasising the indicators of human trafficking which may indicate a person working in such locations is a victim of human trafficking.</p><p>The prevention and detection of human trafficking in all its forms and the protection of its victims has been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2014.</p></reply>

The General Scheme outlines my policy intentions which are to enable the commissioning parents to obtain a "parentage order" through the courts establishing their legal parentage of a child born through an altruistic surrogacy arrangement which complies with the requirements of the draft legislation. I have proposed transitional arrangements which would allow parents to apply for orders in respect of children born through surrogacy arrangements which might not comply with the rules proposed in the General Scheme.  It is proposed that such transitional arrangements would apply in instances where the procedure leading to the surrogate mother's pregnancy and the child's birth took place prior to the commencement of the legislation. The General Scheme also sets out the rules which would apply in relation to establishing the legal parentage of a child born through assisted reproduction if that were the subject of some later dispute. The General Scheme has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny and for public consultation.  I understand that the Committee is holding hearings on the entirety of the Scheme tomorrow. I am keen to progress this legislation as quickly as possible and hope to have it drafted over the coming months with a view to early enactment.</p></reply>

Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation. Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.</p><p>My Department is responsible for the payment of fees and expenses to the legal practitioners. I have no function in the day to day operation of the scheme, the assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid which are matters for the court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.</p><p>There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the scheme.  Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously is not a consideration in determining eligibility for legal aid and such information is not recorded by the Courts Service.</p><p>Expenditure on criminal legal aid in 2013 was &euro;50.8 million.  It is not possible to provide a breakdown of expenditure on a county basis as the majority of barristers addresses are recorded as being at the Law Library, Dublin 7. In seeking to reduce the expenditure on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, the rates of fees paid to the legal practitioners were reduced by 8% in March, 2009, by a further 8% in April, 2010 and by 10% in October, 2011. The reductions in the rates of fees paid has not impacted on the numbers of persons availing of aid with the number of legal aid certificates granted remaining relatively constant over the last five years.</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>As regards civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, which is a statutory independent agency. The Board provides legal services through its nationwide network of law centres and also uses private solicitors to complement this service. The Board received a grant-in-aid of &euro;33.759 million from the Exchequer last year. I am advised that the Board does not produce figures which would allow overall costs to be identified on a county basis. Further information on the Board's finances can be seen in its annual reports (available on ).</p><p>Whilst it is not unusual for an applicant to access civil legal aid services more than once, particularly in family law matters, applicants do not tend to be in receipt of civil legal aid repeatedly. It should be noted that each and every application for civil legal aid is subject to a means test and a merits test, in line with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, and the associated Regulations.</p></reply>

Neither I nor my Department has a legal or constitutional responsibility for dealing with general allegations of  "wrongdoing" in the broadest sense of that word nor should we be expected to do so. However, I can advise the Deputy that my Department does have well established mechanisms for dealing with correspondence which contains allegations of specific wrongdoing related to the general remit of this Department and for allegations of wrongdoing which fall within the remit of other bodies.</p><p>  In relation to correspondence received alluding to criminal matters it is the normal procedure to direct the individual concerned to report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who are the investigative body for such matters.  In circumstances where a person writes to the Department concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the correspondent is advised that they may wish to contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, an independent body set up under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> In relation to allegations relating to specific concerns of wrongdoing falling within the general remit of this Department  I am advised that my officials always try to address the relevant allegations by directing the correspondence to the most appropriate Division and/or relevant body/agency for their attention.  If the matter relates to a Department, body or agency outside the remit of this Department then efforts are invariably made to direct the correspondence as appropriate for attention and direct reply.  With regard to other allegations of general &quot;wrongdoing&quot; relating to agencies that fall within my Department's remit, the individual concerned is advised to the best of the ability of my Department of the avenues open to them to lodge a complaint or seek redress in respect of the matter concerned.</p><p>  On the issue raised by the Deputy of my assuming responsibility for ensuring that the function of dealing with wrongdoing in general is exercised by the responsible parties I am sure that the Deputy is aware that there are many bodies which have statutory, legal and constitutional obligations in this regard which I cannot assume for very good reasons of public policy, law and constitutional practice.  I include in this category the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the investigation of crime, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service as well as numerous other statutory bodies where legislation prescribes a specific governance role to Boards or other office holders or requires that the body concerned exercise an activity without interference from my Department.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.-   Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, including the specifics of cost benefit analysis, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p><p>It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks.</p></reply>

The licensing process must take full account of the outcome of that assessment in reaching a determination on any particular licence application.  It is anticipated that the Appropriate Assessment for Kenmare Bay will be completed this year.  The completion of the Appropriate Assessment will enable my Department to move immediately on the licensing aspects.The Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013 is the framework programme for EU co-funded aid to the seafood sector in Ireland and covers aid up to 2015.  The Programme is based on Council Regulation 1198/2006 concerning the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).  That Regulation specifies the measures that may attract EFF co-funding and provides the state aid basis for those measures.  Member States select certain of the measures included in the Regulation for inclusion in their National Operational Programmes based on national priorities.  This means that not all measures potentially eligible under the Regulation can be funded.  Ireland&rsquo;s Programme does not include measures for compensating aquaculture operators for any additional costs relating to operations in Natura 2000 areas.  However, licensed sites in Kenmare Bay are not subject to any particular additional costs at this time, as they are operating in line with their existing licences pending any renewal of their licence.   Ireland&rsquo;s Programme does include measures to support the development and growth of aquaculture sites and grant aid of up to 40% of eligible costs is available to eligible sites.  The EFF Regulation requires that the Commission and Member States ensure that assistance from the EFF is consistent with the policies, priorities and activities of the Union and that operations financed by the EFF comply with the provisions of the Treaties and the Acts adopted under the Treaties.  This includes the Habitats and Birds Directives.  To give practical effect to this legal obligation, the stakeholder Monitoring Committee approved selection criteria for the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme excluding sites located in Natura 2000 areas from aid under the Scheme until such time as an appropriate assessment has been completed and the site concerned has been licensed taking full account of the conclusions of the appropriate assessment.   Once aquaculture operations in Kenmare Bay have been subject to appropriate assessment, sites licensed within the Bay may become eligible for grant aid under the Scheme. </p></reply>

In general sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. </p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. </p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  </p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. </p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019.</p></reply>

It is opportune, however, to take the opportunity to outline the position regarding the ongoing review of the data contained on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) database.  Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications and  are to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.</p><p>Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.</p><p>The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes</p><p>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee</i>, chaired by Mr P&aacute;draig Gibbons. To date, 90 cases have been forwarded to the Agriculture Appeals Committee on receipt of appeals from the applicants concerned. The committee has not as yet adjudicated on these appeals.</p><p>It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, I announced recently that the number of payment entitlements, which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower. This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.</p><p>A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process. This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.</p></reply>

In order to establish the most appropriate response for forest owners and the forest industry a taskforce, chaired by Mr. Tom Hayes TD, Minister of State, and comprising of the Irish Forest and Forest Products Association, the Irish Timber Growers Association, the Irish Farmers Association, Coillte Teoranta and Teagasc has been put in place to assess the damage nationally and to identify the various issues arising.</p><p>  The taskforce has issued a guidance note for forest owners, laying down the steps to consider in safely harvesting and selling the fallen trees and giving advice on a range of other associated issues. Teagasc forestry advisers are available to discuss the issue with forest owners affected and Teagasc, in association with Coillte and my Department, have organised a number of field events for forest owners.  Forest owners are also urged to get professional advice from qualified foresters to guide them through this process and to attend these windblow field days.  While direct financial support is not being provided to those whose forests were destroyed in the storm, I can confirm that any premium payments that have not yet been paid for 2014 will be paid even if these forests have been affected by this windblow event.</p></reply>

In accordance with the EU Regulations, the SI gives full effect to a point system for the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat.  The points system applies where a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy by an EU Fishing vessel is detected within the Exclusive Fishery Limits of the State or for an Irish vessel, wherever it may be. In my reply to question number 14/13995 of 26 March 2014, I stated that the regulation and SI also applies to third country fishing vessels, this is not accurate as the scope is confined to EU fishing vessels.</p><p>  The purpose of the EU Regulation stated in the recital is to create a level playing field in fisheries control across the EU.  All Member States have given effect to the Article 92 of the Council Regulation in respect of the points system to apply for license holders.  The accumulation of points for persistent serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy will lead to the suspension of a sea fishing boat licence for a period from 2 months to one year. In extreme cases persistent serious fisheries infringements could lead to the permanent withdrawal of a licence.  It should also be noted that I have, in the Statutory Instrument, made provision for a robust and effective appeals process. This process will deliver on the requirements in Article 126(4) of the Commission regulation to deliver an effective system.</p></reply>

Decisions relating to allocation of entitlements under the National Reserve element of the Single Payment scheme have previously been made following consultation with the Single Payment Advisory committee which included members of Teagasc and the farming organisations.  I intend to continue this process under the new regime. Decisions regarding objective criteria such as income limits will be decided following consultation with this group.

These entitlements have been leased out on a yearly basis since 2007 including for the scheme year 2013. As the person named did not receive a direct payment in 2013 he does not have an automatic allocation right and will not be allocated entitlements in 2015 under the Basic Payment Scheme. When calculating the value of entitlements in 2015, the value of entitlements leased out in 2014 is attributed to the owner of the entitlements. However as the person named does not have an allocation right, he is not in a position to carry forward the value of entitlements he owns to the new scheme in 2015.

Exports of food and drink to other EU markets increased by 11% in 2013 reaching &euro;3.2 billion with the key markets of Germany, France and the Netherlands all recording double digit growth.  Strong exports to Asia, and to a lesser extent Russia, contributed positively toward an increase of 6% in the value of trade to international markets, which exceeded &euro;2.6 billion in the period.  My Department works very closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia to assist Irish food producers to identify new markets and/or increase market share of existing markets.</p><p><b>Action Plan for Jobs</b></p><p>My Department liaises closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in relation to the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes 29 headline actions to be undertaken by my Department and relevant agencies on:</p><p>-  developing agri-food and marine SMEs;</p><p>-  supporting sectors of high growth potential;</p><p>-  improving Ireland&rsquo;s  agri-food sustainability performance; and</p><p>-  reviewing agri-taxation measures to ensure maximum benefit to the sector.</p><p>Progress on implementation of these actions is monitored by the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  The HLIC, which I chair, consists of the senior officials of all state agencies involved in the agriculture, food and fisheries sector.  In 2013 Irish food and drink exports reached &euro;9.9bn and are on track to meet the Food Harvest 2020 target of &euro;12bn by the end of this decade.  The launch of the Bord Bia Sustainability Development Programme Origin Green in 2012 positions Ireland and the Irish food and drink industry as a world leader in sustainable food production. </p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland</b></p><p>My Department has an extensive and long-standing relationship with Enterprise Ireland (EI), which is focused on supporting the growth and development of the agrifood industry and the expansion of export opportunities.  In order to export successfully, and meet the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, the food industry&rsquo;s capacity and capability to develop and deliver products and services in line with customer requirements are vital.  This Department and Enterprise Ireland work together, sharing expertise, to support developments in a variety of areas.  Contacts vary from formal participation across a range of committees which progress different policy areas to ongoing daily informal contacts.</p><p><b>Bord Bia</b></p><p>My Department also assists Irish food producers to commence or increase exporting through its engagement with Bord Bia &ndash; the State Body charged with the growth of success of Irish food and horticulture who act as a link between Irish food, drink and horticulture suppliers and existing and potential customers throughout the world.  One of Bord Bia&rsquo;s objectives is to strengthen and extend the ability of Irish food and drink companies, driven through market insight, to build profitable share in selected high-potential export markets.  Seafood promotion on domestic and international markets is also now included in their brief.</p><p>In 2013, the Irish food and drink sector continued the strong export performance of recent years despite the ongoing competitive nature of most markets.  The strongest performers were dairy, meat and livestock and prepared foods.  Whiskey also continued to perform very strongly.  Seafood saw a levelling off in exports following a rise of almost 65% over the 2009 to 2012 period.</p></reply>

Both yields and quality of later cut hay and silage were good, while yields of specialist crops such as fodder maize and beet were well above average. Excellent conditions last Autumn provided an opportunity for farmers to extend the grazing season. The indications are that there is a satisfactory supply of fodder available at present and with many farmers now turning out their animals, it is anticipated that adequate supplies of fodder will be available. Supplementary concentrate feeding has fallen significantly in cost since last year and adequate volumes of fodder continue to be advertised on farming media and associated websites. At my request, Teagasc have prioritised the continued need for budgeting of fodder stock on farms through the media, discussion groups and one to one advisory contacts.</p></reply>

It involved bringing together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The establishment of the new Agency with a budget of over &euro;600m represents one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  </p><p>  In preparation for the disaggregation of services from the HSE a comprehensive log of all premises was compiled setting out the locations from which child and family services operate. This log includes premises used exclusively by child and family services, rented accommodation and premises shared with HSE services.  The Agency is committed to working with the HSE to ensure arrangements continue to meet both their respective needs.  A Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the HSE has been agreed which sets out a range of provisions that support the functional delivery of services by the Agency.</p><p>  Child and Family Services operate from a range of properties in the Waterford area, only one of which is rented exclusively for Child and Family Services at St. Andrew's Terrace, Newtown. Another is rented on a shared basis at Johnstown.  The remaining premises are in the ownership of the State.</p><p>  A new facility at Belmont, Ferrybank which currently houses an Early Years Service on the ground floor will shortly accommodate some of the Agency's local child and family services.  This premises has a long term-lease at nominal cost.  Its construction was funded by a number of State Agencies, including the HSE, and two adjoining Local Authorities using once off capital funds.  Additional capital funding was allocated to fit it out to meet the needs of the Agency.  There are no plans for additional facilities in this area.</p></reply>

The Child and Family Agency are currently engaged in an asset reconciliation process with the HSE and any relevant information on motor vehicles will be forwarded to the Deputy when it is to hand.  The Children Detention Schools in Oberstown have 14 vehicles in State ownership. As the vehicles are State owned they are exempt from the requirement for private motor insurance for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act 1961. However, it is a requirement to apply for and to display a motor tax disk on these vehicles and this is arranged each year. </p><p>  My Department and the Children Detention Schools are clients of the State Claims Agency, which manages personal injury and property damage claims on behalf of State authorities, their servants or agents.  Any claims which may arise in relation to these vehicles are managed by the State Claims Agency.  </p><p>  The State Claims Agency have confirmed that in respect of vehicles owned by delegated State bodies, in compliance with Public Financial Procedures, there is no commercial insurance policy in place.  However a State Indemnity applies.</p><p>  Should a claim arise relating to personal injury and third party property damage from an incident owned by a delegated State body, this will be handled by the State Claims Agency. Should a claim arise relating to damage to a State vehicle the cost will be borne by the State body/Department.</p><p>  The State Claims Agency has indicated that they are only in a position to provide information on claims that are under their remit i.e. personal injury (employee&rsquo;s and members of the public) and third party property damage.  Thus we would only have available summary information on the number of road traffic collisions involving a particular Department.

An update on progress in relation to the Strategy was sent to the EU Commission as recently as January 2014.</p><p>  I am informed that the term &ldquo;Roma&rdquo; as defined by the Council of Europe  embraces in the Irish context both indigenous Irish Travellers and &ldquo;Roma&rdquo; in the sense of persons of Roma origin who have come to Ireland exercising their right of free movement. The 2011 Census recorded 29,573 persons who identified themselves as Irish Travellers and while there are no official statistics on the number of Roma in Ireland a figure of 3,000 has been cited by the Roma Support Group Pavee Point.</p><p>  I note the concerns expressed in the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance&rsquo;s Report Card 2014 in relation to improving the lives of Traveller and migrant children. Clearly there are challenges for Government in this regard. In reply to a recent parliamentary question (Ref No. 14008/14 from Deputy O'Caol&aacute;in on 27th March 2014), I outlined a range of supports for traveller and migrant children that are funded by my Department to support youth services, education and family support initiatives and to address child poverty. The new Child and Family Agency also has a key role to play in the context its statutory remit for services previously provided by the National Educational Welfare Board, relating to educational welfare and school completion and through its network of Family Resource Centres. </p><p>  The National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, which I plan to launch shortly, will cover the seven year period from 2014 to 2020. It will address Government commitments in relation to Traveller / Roma children and assist the collaboration across Government in implementing the National Strategy. </p></reply>

The total number of children adopted into the top twelve receiving states in 2004 was 43,142. In 2011, this figure had dropped to 21,911 &ndash; a drop of 50 per cent. The United States which receives by far the largest number of adoptions has seen a reduction of almost 60 per cent over this period. </p><p>  These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child protection safeguards have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.   In many cases these reforms in countries of origin have been given expression and impetus by their ratification of the Hague Convention.  The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21. With the passing of the Adoption Act 2010 Ireland ratified the Hague Convention on the 1st November 2010 and is now one of 93 contracting States to the Convention.  </p><p>  Very significant efforts have been underway on the part of the Adoption Authority - with strong support from myself and my Department - to promote cooperation in intercountry adoption with relevant countries.  The Adoption Authority has successfully concluded administrative agreements with both Vietnam and the US. The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of Hague Convention countries in relation to intercountry adoptions including Bulgaria, China, Thailand, the Philippines and India.  The Adoption Authority has recently visited Haiti as part of an initial examination of intercountry adoption with Haiti.</p><p>  It is important to recognise that, although a country may be a member of Hague, legal and administrative obstacles may remain, there may be no children available for adoption or restrictions may be imposed in relation to the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying.   </p><p>  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague Convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position. </p><p>  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention.  However, my Department is continuing its discussion with the Russian authorities with a view to exploring the possibilities of establishing a bi-lateral agreement.  </p><p>  With regard to Cambodia, the Authority advises that it has no direct links with the adoption authorities in Cambodia and Ireland has no resident diplomatic presence in Cambodia. The Authority was not aware of any recent meetings regarding intercountry adoption from that country.</p></reply>

The most recent inspection took place in October 2012.  Significant progress has been made since earlier inspections, however inspectors found that some deficits identified had not been rectified.  In February 2013, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs established a National Monitoring and Oversight Group within the HSE, which included input from a national expert on Foster Care, to ensure that the recommendations from the Action Plan were carried out.  The Group met monthly and submitted a report in October 2013.  The progress made against the eighty HIQA Actions included:</p><p>  -  The completion of a review of all outstanding concerns and allegations between 30 September 2009 and 31 December 2012 regarding foster carers in Dublin North West</p><p>  -  A child protection notification system (CPNS) is now in place.</p><p>  -  Stronger management oversight in relation to risk.</p><p>  -  Significant improvements in the governance and work of the Foster Care Committees. </p><p>  The Deputy refers to legacy cases which I assume relates to unapproved foster carers.  I am advised that foster care assessments for unapproved relative foster carers were scheduled to be completed by the end of the year with the exception of four complex cases.</p><p>  The Agency has now responsibility for Foster Care Services and is continuing the work initiated by the HSE.  A regional Oversight Group is in place which oversees implementation of the Action Plan and reports to the DCYA.  The last report received in February 2014 indicates that an updated progress plan was submitted to HIQA in January 2014.  In addition, the area manager for Dublin North City has met with HIQA on two occasions between November 2013 and January 2014.  Risk and safety plans in respect of all children where concerns have been raised have been completed.  Regular meetings are held between the manager with responsibility for the CPNS and monitoring officers to review all allegations and concerns and track any outstanding actions. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-08a.1480.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014040800075#WRY02500"><p>I fully appreciate that the desire to know one's identity, or to re-establish contact with a child,  is very fundamental and entirely reasonable. I acknowledge that the existing procedures in the area of information and tracing, both legislative and administrative, are not ideal and I have been anxious to see improvement in this regard.</p><p>  As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill. A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided. The right to privacy has been firmly established as a constitutional right through a series of legal cases which began in 1974 with McGee v. Attorney General, which concerned marital privacy, and culminated in the Kennedy v. Ireland case in 1987 where a general Constitutional right to privacy was recognised. The right to privacy was also recognised in the IO'T v .B case, a supreme court case from 1998.  The case concerned two people who were the subject of so-called &quot; informal&quot; adoptions. The majority of the Court held that a natural child had an implied constitutional right to know the identity of his or her mother though this had to be balanced against the right of the natural mother to privacy.</p><p>  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues. One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy. I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution. This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill. </p><p>  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed. Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.</p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements to existing procedures for the provision of adoption information and tracing services, which are provided nationally by the Child and Family Agency. A number of religious orders have transferred records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Child and Family Agency.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records is underway and the advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. </p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. </p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.</p><p>  I can assure you that I am anxious to provide access to as much adoption information as possible taking account of relevant legal and constitutional considerations.  </p></reply>

I received the interim report of the Group which dealt primarily with training issues in December. The Group is now focusing on career structures and pathways following training and is due to report very shortly on these issues. The final report of the Group is to be submitted to me by the end of June 2014. I am confident that the implementation of the findings of this strategic review will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. </p><p>  It should be noted that there are some specialties, at consultant and NCHD level in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill. Filling these posts represents a significant challenge given that there is a competitive market for consultants and NCHDs with these specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters. The planned establishment of hospital groups should help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital. Where posts are vacant and suitable candidates cannot be sourced, locums are retained or alternative arrangements are made to ensure the continued delivery of the service. </p><p>  In relation to the specific query regarding Letterkenny Hospital, I have forwarded the question to the Health Service Executive who will respond directly to the Deputy in this regard. </p></reply>

However, those who present for addiction treatment for gambling are offered the same range of interventions as those who present with a drug and alcohol addiction, or a mental health concern.  Counselling and rehabilitation services provide care to those presenting with a gambling addiction through one to one counselling, financial advice and onward referral to other statutory and voluntary groups where appropriate, such as Gamblers Anonymous. </p><p>  The HSE also provides funding to a number of voluntary service providers who treat gambling addictions in addition to drug and alcohol addictions. This funding is provided from Drug and Alcohol services core funding.  The apportionment of funding dedicated solely to gambling addiction cannot be extracted from overall funding.</p><p>  The identified HSE expenditure for Addiction Services in 2012 totalled &euro;90.752m.  The allocation for 2013 was &euro;91.546m. In addition, other areas of the HSE provide services to clients with addiction problems &ndash; these include Health Promotion, Mental Health (with the exception of the North West area which is included in the above figure), Acute Hospital Services and Emergency Departments, and Primary Care.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children under 6 years with access to a GP service without fees.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation, which I expect to be published shortly.  </p><p>A draft contract for the provision of free GP care to children under 6 years, is currently the subject of a consultation process.  When drafting the contract, consideration was given to <i>Healthy Ireland, a framework for improved health and wellbeing 2013 &ndash; 2025.</i>This is the Government's national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of our population, including children, over the coming generation.  Based on international evidence, it outlines a new commitment to public health with an emphasis on prevention and stronger health systems.  It addresses risk factors and promotes protective actions at every stage of life including early childhood.</p><p>Healthy Ireland has been informed by feedback from an extensive consultation process within Government, the health sector and wider public and private society.  It reflects international experience and evidence of what determines health and reflects best practice in how to prioritise and invest for health and invest for long-term sustainable health benefits.</p><p>A key feature of the draft contract, therefore, is to reorient the focus of primary care towards prevention and health promotion in addition to diagnosis and treatment.  In accordance with the principles of Healthy Ireland, there is a broad range of evidence from the international scientific literature on the value of health surveillance and health promoting activities on issues such as overweight and obesity in early childhood. I will write to the Deputy providing specific references. </p></reply>

The Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill 2013 that is currently at Committee stage outlines a scheme that would require the owners of particular types of premises or venues to install and maintain defibrillators so that they would be available for public use. The health technology assessment of public access defibrillation currently being conducted by HIQA will examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different configurations of any potential public access defibrillation programme. The results of this assessment will be used to inform decision making on issues related to the bill. This project is scheduled for completion in late 2014.</p><p>  No information is available on the exact numbers of AEDs that are currently in use in Ireland. Based on data from a number of suppliers, it is estimated that in excess of 17,000 units have been sold in this country since 1998. However no information is currently available on the locations of these devices, what proportion are maintained and functional, and how many are available for use by the public.  Analysis of the existing availability of automatic external defibrillators will form part of the HIQA health technology assessment that is due to be completed in late 2014.</p></reply>

Both of these are record numbers.  </p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2014 provides an additional &euro;2.92m for organ donation and transplantation services. The &euro;2.92m will facilitate the appointment of 19 wholetime equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation - including consultants, network link nurses, organ procurement officers and quality officers.  These staff will comprise a key element of the organ donation effort in each of the hospital groups around the country. They will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation, optimise conversion rates and champion educational strategies and training programmes that promote organ donation to health care professionals across each hospital group.  </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing organ donation and transplantation rates is further underlined by the re-commissioning of a theatre in Beaumont Hospital for transplantation use at a cost of &euro;1.2m.  Beaumont Hospital has completed the recruitment of nurses for this facility and these nurses are now being trained to take on the specialised work involved.  The theatre will be in use for kidney transplants from May 2014 and I expect the rate of transplants will increase incrementally over subsequent months.</p><p>  The National Renal Transplant Programme at Beaumont progresses the &lsquo;work-up&rsquo; (clinical assessment and a range of diagnostic procedures) of donors and recipients on the live donor programme in an organised way to facilitate the smooth running of the overall service.  Preparing patients and their donors too far in advance would render some of the clinical assessments and diagnostics invalid, thus requiring some repeat procedures. The management of this process involves the holding back of some donors and recipients so that they will not be worked up too far in advance of their procedure.</p><p>  Already 10 living donor transplants have been completed in 2014 and I am confident, with the new theatre coming on stream in May, that the 2013 record will be exceeded this year.  </p></reply>

The Tobacco Directive will: </p><p>-  set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes,</p><p>-  make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory,</p><p>-  introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes,</p><p>-  impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  </p><p>The Tobacco Products Directive does not cover rules on smoke free environments in relation to e-cigarettes. As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco their use is not prohibited in workplaces as is the case with tobacco products under the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 to 2011. Agencies can, however, on a voluntary basis have policies in this regard.</p><p>In view of the lack of sufficient research and information regarding e-cigarettes,  my Department will continue to monitor existing and emerging evidence on the potential harm and the potential benefits of e-cigarettes. However it is my intention to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to those under the age of 18 years.</p></reply>

Despite the best efforts of the HSE it had not been possible to attract senior managers with the requisite expertise to run the hospitals.  For that reason individual senior managers were identified from within the system to take on new Group CEO roles for a period.</p><p>  Mr Bill Maher was identified as the most appropriate person to take on the role of Chief Executive of the Galway/Roscommon hospital group, on a secondment basis for three years from his position as Chief Operations Officer at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  Following a request by the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) approved this secondment on a personal-to-holder basis.  The remuneration package reflected the level at which Mr Maher was being remunerated by the St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital Group in respect of his duties in the public hospital and additional work undertaken separately for St Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital.</p><p>  These secondment arrangements were approved as an exceptional matter and did not represent a change in overall public service pay policy.  One of the conditions of the DPER sanction was that this arrangement should be subject to annual review.  I can confirm that the National Director of Acute Hospitals in the HSE is in the process of reviewing the secondment arrangement of Mr. Maher to the Galway Hospital Group.</p></reply>

A proper discharge care plan which is discussed between the hospital consultant team and primary care needs to be agreed and activated.  Home ventilation needs appropriate equipment, trained staff and both patient and family education as well as arrangement for upkeep and maintenance of such ventilation equipment.  Nurses supervising such patients at home need to be appropriately qualified and competent to supervise the patient clinically.</p><p>  The HSE is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, therefore, the request for specific statistics concerning the provision of home ventilation services has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

Prazepam shares the characteristics of benzodiazepines in general, including the need to use them for the shortest length of time possible and to gradually reduce the dose when discontinuing treatment to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  The product information for Centrax approved by the Irish Medicines Board includes these warnings and recommends a maximum treatment time of 4-6 weeks including the time for the tapering-off process.  It also states that extensions to this time period should be based on a re-evaluation of the patient's status by specialist experts.</p><p>  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website, Centrax has been discontinued in the US but my Department is not aware of any safety concerns regarding long-term use specific to this medicine other than the general concerns relating to benzodiazepines generally.</p><p>  Benzodiazepines are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms and consequently are primarily recommended for short-term treatment only.  My Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to, amongst other issues, introducing tighter controls on benzodiazepine medicines.

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children can be accessed through both the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s primary care services and its disability services.</p><p>The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 provided for additional funding of &euro;20m to strengthen primary care services.  This comprises over &euro;18.5m for the recruitment of over 260 primary care team posts and over &euro;1.4m to support community intervention team development.  The posts include 52<font color="#FF0000"> </font>whole-time equivalent Speech and Language Therapists.  The recruitment process is ongoing in relation to these posts, with the majority of the posts filled or offered, subject to start dates being agreed.</p><p>In terms of disability services, therapy services for children are currently being reconfigured into geographically-based multidisciplinary teams, as part of the HSE&rsquo;s <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18years) Programme.</i>The objective of this Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  The National Service Plan 2014 provides for targeted investment of &euro;4m for the roll out of this Programme which equates to 80 additional therapy posts.</p><p>The Executive has introduced a number of initiatives to ensure that therapy services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible and on the basis of prioritised need within available resources.  These include therapists increasing clinic based work instead of domiciliary work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  The additional investment that is being made in both primary care and disability services and the re-configuration of children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based multidisciplinary teams will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, including speech and language therapy.</p><p>Finally, the figure cited by the Deputy, which is taken from the HSE's speech and language therapy minimum data set includes both children and adults waiting for initial speech and language therapy assessment up to the end of December 2013.  The comparable figure for January 2014 indicates that the number of children and adults waiting for initial speech and language therapy assessment had fallen to 12,877.  (It should be noted that data collected by the HSE in this regard does not provide a breakdown on the basis of age).</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will have a choice of health insurer and access to a standard package of health services.  In addition, a system of financial protection will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising UHI premiums for those who qualify.</p><p>The<i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i>was published on 2nd April and is available on my Department's website at www.health.gov.ie.  It provides substantial detail on the UHI model for Ireland, the process for determining the future health basket, including the standard package of services covered under UHI, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to UHI.  A wide-ranging public consultation on the overall policy set out in the White Paper also commenced on 2nd April.  The process remains open for submissions from the public and other stakeholders until 28th May.  A separate consultation on the contents of the future health basket will also be undertaken.</p><p>The White Paper makes reference to a number of background technical documents, notably the <i>Policy Paper on Raising Resources for Universal Health Insurance </i>and <i>The Policy Paper on Designing the Future Health Basket,</i>that were produced by my Department in order to inform the development of the policy set out in the White Paper.  These key documents will be published on the Department's website soon.  I would also like to draw attention to the preliminary paper on UHI, <i>The Path to Universal Health Insurance, </i>published in February, 2013 on my Department's website which outlines an update of work on UHI to Feb 2012 as well as providing further detail on the path ahead.</p><p>As noted in the White Paper, my Department reviewed multi-payer models across a number of countries, having regard to the policy set out in the Programme for Government, including the Netherlands and Germany. Part of this work included organising a seminar in Dublin in 2011 on universal health insurance which was attended by experts from the World Health Organisation, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Dutch Health Ministry.  My officials also undertook  study visits to the Netherlands in June 2011 to examine the Dutch health insurance model and to Germany in 2012 to advance our thinking on the introduction of a prospective case-based Money Follows the Patient system for funding hospitals, which is one of the key building blocks for the introduction of UHI.  In November 2013, my Department organised a one day policy dialogue with international experts in the field of national health basket design, facilitated by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, in order to inform the development of <i>The Policy Paper on Designing the Future Health Basket</i>.</p><p>I should, however, make it clear that while important to learn from other countries' experiences of multi-payer health insurance systems, it was never our intention to merely adopt a system from another country.  In designing a UHI model for Ireland, our aim has been to ensure that it meets the needs of those living in Ireland and that it achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  Ultimately, this Government aim is to introduce an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system.  My intention is to have  all the necessary groundwork in place in early 2016 to enable us to phase in implementation of UHI between 2016 and 2019.</p></reply>

The Development Board is  currently in the final selection phase of the process leading to the appointment of the Design Team.  Short-listed architectural teams have been announced (available at www.newchildrenshospital.ie) and tender documents issued on 24 March to these and all shortlisted bidders across all design team disciplines.  </p><p>  The Development Board had sought to have a design team appointed by April with the target of submitting planning permission in the autumn.  However, the process of design team procurement is now expected to be completed in June.  This reflects the need for very rigorous financial evaluation prior to finalising the shortlist.  It also reflects a very robust and detailed approach to the preparation of the design tender documents in order to ensure that they build in value engineering, look at ways of delivering the project as quickly as possible, provide for a more collaborative approach and contain the required flexibility.  Following appointment of the design team, design development will begin with the aim being to make a planning submission in February 2015.  I am advised that overall the project remains on track to commence transition of services to the new children's hospital at the end of 2018. </p><p>  I also announced in January that satellite centres of the main hospital would be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.

These Regulations have been amended on a number of occasions since then, most recently by the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2011, which came into effect on 23 July 2011.  </p><p>  The Regulations made under the Act provide for two different classes of charges:</p><p>- Class 1- charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week) and</p><p>- Class 2 - charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24 hour nursing care is not provided are based on income, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week). </p><p>  A person in receipt of Disability Allowance at the current maximum rate of &euro;188 p.w. would be liable, subject to a financial assessment, to a maximum charge under Class 1 of &euro;155 p.w. and under Class 2 of &euro;120 p.w.  The charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a minimum income for personal use i.e. at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p><p>  Section 53(4) of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person in order to avoid undue financial hardship to that person.  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the Act and the related Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination and levying of charges for in-patient services, which include the need to have regard to the income of the person, the provisions of the Regulations and the patient's individual circumstances.</p><p>  With regard to the individual in question, I am advised by the HSE that Class 1 charges were applicable between 15 July 2005 and 17 October 2010 and that Class 2 charges were applicable from 18 October 2010 until 30 March 2013. </p></reply>

However, I am determined to address these issues and to promote a sustainable private health insurance market as we move towards Universal Health Insurance.</p><p>  I have consistently emphasised the need for much greater cost control in the private health insurance industry so that premiums are affordable for as many people as possible.  I appointed an independent chair to work with health insurers, the HIA and my own Department to identify effective strategies for costs management.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin's first report, published at the end of December, made a number of important recommendations now being pursued by insurers, the HSE and my Department.  These recommendations include measures to control costs, greatly improve clinical audit, streamline claims processing and address fraud, waste and abuse in the industry.  Work on  Phase II of Mr. McLoughlin's report, which will deal further with the factors driving costs in health insurance,  is progressing well and will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.  The HIA may also be contacted by phone at LoCall 1850 929 166.</p></reply>

Doctors who wish to pursue GP training in Ireland may apply for a general practice training post in one of the 14 GP Training Programmes.  In July 2010, the GP trainee intake increased from 120 to 157 training places per year.</p><p>  As the breakdown by County of the number of GP training places is not routinely provided to the Department by the HSE, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</p><p>  In July of last year, my colleague Dr James Reilly, Minister for Health, established a Working Group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure.  The Working Group will examine and make high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to improving graduate retention in the public health system, planning for future service needs, and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p><p>  Professor MacCraith was asked to furnish the Group's final report by the end of June 2014.  In this context, I understand that the Working Group has had initial engagement with stakeholders including trainee doctors, the IMO, the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies, the Medical Council and the HSE.  Engagement with stakeholders will continue throughout the process to prepare the final report.</p><p>  The HSE is currently engaged in a medical workforce planning project, which will include a workforce plan for GPs.  When this work has been completed, it will assist in identifying GP requirements.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, the Government has decided to commence the roll-out of universal GP services by providing all children under six years with access to a GP service without fees.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation, which is expected to be published shortly.  The aim is to have this measure in place by mid-year.</p><p>  The introduction of this service also requires a new contractual framework to be put in place between the HSE and individual general practitioners.  In this regard, a draft contract is currently the subject of a consultation process.  While there has been some negative reaction to the draft contract, I am pleased that the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), the primary representative body for general practitioners, has confirmed that it is supportive of Government policy to introduce GP care free at the point of access, albeit conditional on the provision of adequate resources and full and meaningful negotiations with the IMO.</p><p>I have assured the IMO, most recently in a letter dated 26th March, that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  I have also explained that there will be an opportunity for input from the IMO on the fee structure, which will be addressed by means of a complementary consultation process.</p><p>  I trust that the IMO will accept this invitation to commence negotiations with the Department and the HSE.  This will afford them the fullest opportunity to obtain clarification from the Department and the HSE on any aspect of the draft contract and to raise any other issues which they may have regarding it.  A process of open discussion has the potential to significantly enhance the draft contract for patients, GPs, the HSE and the Department, thus helping to progress our common goal of free GP care at the point of access.</p></reply>

All nursing homes are subject to the same core standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents. Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent registration and inspection of designated centres providing residential services for older people.</p><p>The Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres) Regulations 2009 require that each resident&rsquo;s needs are set out in an individual care plan developed and agreed with each resident.  The Regulations, which underpin HIQA's <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for older People</i>also require that suitable and sufficient care is provided to maintain the resident&rsquo;s welfare and well-being, having regard to the nature and extent of the resident&rsquo;s dependency and needs as set out in their care plan.</p><p>If the Deputy has concerns about a particular nursing home, it is a matter for HIQA to determine whether that nursing home is in breach of the Regulations or the quality standards. If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.</p></reply>

These guidelines are a National Maternity Early Warning Score Guideline, a National Paediatric Early Warning Score Guideline, a National Sepsis Management Guideline and a National Clinical Handover Guideline.  I expect these guidelines to not only detail best practice but also to make recommendations for staff education and training.  This is in order to provide for assurance of the competence of our doctors, nurses and midwives for these critical life-saving clinical issues.</p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that significant progress has been made on this work to date.</p></reply>

The priority is to maintain safety standards and to protect and extract maximum value from existing infrastructure, rather than the development of new transport infrastructure.   In relation to heavy rail, the focus is on maintaining the existing network and renewing key infrastructure assets. The bulk of the capital funding available for heavy rail each year, amounting to over &euro;114million in 2014, is allocated for the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract (IMMAC), required under EU regulation to fund the maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network. The IMMAC replaces the Railway Safety Programme which had an annual spend of approximately &euro;100m across the entire network.</p><p>  There are no plans for light rail investments outside of the Greater Dublin Area in the &ldquo;Medium Term Exchequer Framework&rdquo;.</p><p>  Due to the reduced funding and the priority for maintaining existing road transport infrastructure, no direct Exchequer funded road development projects are scheduled to go to construction for the next number of years.  A number of PPP projects, including the N7/N11, the N17/N18 Gort to Tuam, the N25 New Ross Bypass and the N11 Gorey-Enniscorthy projects are however being progressed.  With the exception of the Newlands Cross interchange and the Rathnew N11 upgrade, all of these PPPs are outside the Greater Dublin Area.</p><p>  Consideration of a new government capital investment plan to 2020 has begun. This will involve a focused review of the medium-term capital envelope to take account of investment priorities for the next 5 years.</p><p>  My priority, as under the current plan, will be to protect investment made to date and maintain safety standards. If additional funds are available there will be many competing transport projects across all modes and from all regions. Only projects for which there is a clear identifiable need, which are affordable, have a robust business case and add value to existing infrastructure, will be prioritised for funding to 2020.</p></reply>

The NTA has recently undertaken a tender competition for the supply, installation, operation and maintenance of bike share schemes in those cities.  Tenders sought from five shortlisted candidates were received by the NTA in February of this year.  The assessment of the tenders is due to be concluded shortly. It is anticipated that construction of the bike schemes will commence shortly thereafter with the schemes becoming operational later this year.  Funding  to meet the capital investment costs of public bikes in other cities has been identified within the 5-year capital allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures announced in 2012.  The delivery of the Regional Cities Bike Scheme was also dependent on  a separate process to explore the potential for a sponsorship contract to defray some of the costs associated with the introduction of the Scheme.   I was delighted to be able to report last September that Coca Cola emerged as the successful sponsor for the Scheme.</p><p>  The vision behind the Scheme is to develop an environmentally friendly means of public transport that is healthy, relatively inexpensive and will ensure an improved quality of life in each city&rsquo;s natural and built environment.   Public bike schemes have the potential to enhance the city centres and provide a significant boost to the development of a cycling culture.  They also add to the tourism offering in those cities.</p></reply>

Likewise, issues relating to public transport links and services to particular towns are a matter for individual transport operators, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, as appropriate.   Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not made any proposal to my Department to re-open Killucan station.  As the Deputy will be aware, CIE is in a difficult financial position and is dependent on continued bank funding.  It has no resources of its own available to fund new projects and there is no funding in the current capital plan for Killucan station.  The lifetime of the Government's current capital investment plan runs to 2016 and with the available funding  the priority is to protect the operational network and maintain safety standards, rather than the opening of new stations. </p><p>  Consideration of a new capital investment plan to 2020 will begin shortly. Prioritisation of individual rail projects for funding will depend on the overall funding made available to transport for all modes, and within that, the funds made available for heavy rail. The priority for heavy rail post 2016 will be, as at present, the protection of the operational network and the maintenance of safety standards. If there are additional funds after that, and this is not certain, there will be competing demands between the opening of new lines, the improvement of existing lines, rolling stock upgrades, the upgrade of in use train stations, as well as the opening of new train stations in different parts of the country. All of these competing demands will be subject to robust analysis and will require strong business cases justifying their value and demonstrating how they will significantly increase patronage on the rail network.</p><p>  When opening a new station on an existing line, consideration must be given to both the benefits of gaining new passengers and also the downsides of the cost of constructing and running the new station, and also the risk of losing other passengers due to increased journey times.</p><p>   </p></reply>

As indicated in my earlier responses, there are currently two vacancies in the RO III grade. A competition was advertised on publicjobs.ie on 21st March 2014 with a closing date for receipt of applications of 18 April, 2014.  On completion of basic training officers will be assigned as required to any of the 3 marine rescue centres. The two existing vacancies will be filled from this competition and a panel will also be formed to fill other vacancies as they arise in order to maintain the authorised complement at 40 officers. In relation to the upgrade of the technology systems at Malin head, the operations room at the centre has recently been completely refurbished and new equipment fitted as part of the Coast Guard upgrade of its communications and ancillary infrastructure at the three rescue co-ordination centres.  In addition, my Department will be introducing an integrated incident logging system in the three centres to facilitate interoperability and improved services.  The tender process for this is almost complete and it is anticipated that work will commence later this year.</p><p>   </p></reply>

For this reason,  the NTA is undertaking a technical consultancy to assess the long term rail transport requirements of the North Dublin/Fingal corridor, extending from Finglas to Malahide and including Dublin Airport and Swords.  This review will examine existing proposals including Metro North as well as other options for a rail-based transport solution to meet the area's needs in the long term. I expect to have a report on the outcome of this review by the end of the year.</p><p>  Under the current capital plan to 2016, funding is available for the initial design and route selection of a small number of BRT schemes. Funding for delivery of these  schemes, of which Swords/Airport has been identified as a priority, will be examined as part of the recently announced review of  the medium term capital envelope to take account of priorities to 2020.  My Departments key priority to 2020 will be, as under the current plan,  to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards. If  additional funds are available,  which is not certain,  there will be many competing transport projects from all modes in all regions.  Only projects for which there is a clear need,  which are affordable, have a sound business case  and add value to  existing infrastructure will be prioritised  for funding to 2020. </p></reply>
