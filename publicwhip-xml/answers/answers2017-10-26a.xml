The annual increasing delivery expectation of Part V is consistent with the pace of increasing private housing construction activity.</p>  <p>  With regard to costs, the Planning and Development Acts set out the methodology for calculating the net monetary value of units under Part V agreements. Section 96(3)(d)(ii) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out that the construction costs to be paid to the developer in respect of the construction of units are  &ldquo;the costs, including normal construction and development costs and profit on those costs, calculated at open market rates that would have been incurred by the planning authority had it retained an independent builder to undertake the works, including the appropriate share of any common development works, as agreed between the authority and the developer.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  My Department supports local authorities and approved housing bodies to secure new social homes through the Part V mechanism using financial assistance from my Department under a variety of social housing financing programmes. In addition, some local authorities can acquire Part V units directly using their own funding and therefore, full details on such transactions would not be available to my Department. Given that the cost and output of units delivered through Part V is a matter in the first place for local authorities to agree with developers, local authorities welcome this flexibility in funding arrangements.</p>  <p>  Overall, the funding earmarked for the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is being increased from &euro;5.35bn to over &euro;6 billion. Part V is a critical component of that delivery and, according as decisions are made on the delivery mechanism to be used to fund Part V units in individual developments, the necessary funding will be made available to the relevant local authorities and approved housing bodies.   </p></reply>

The Nitrates Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.</p><p>It was recognised that the exceptional rainfall in recent weeks has created difficulties for slurry spreading in certain parts of the country resulting in animal welfare concerns. My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine agreed an appropriate response and farmers with concerns about the impact of recent rainfall on their ability to complete the land-spreading of slurry were advised to contact the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with details of the flooding / trafficability situation, their herd number and other relevant data in advance of the closed period commencing on 15 October.</p><p>I understand that 578 farmers out of a total number of bovine farmers of 109,000 contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  The Nitrates Section of that Department will now be making follow-up contact with each of those farmers. </p><p>Farmers who contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard were advised: </p><p>1.  To spread only that volume of slurry necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity for the remainder of the closed period</p><p>2.  That any spreading should occur as soon as good spreading conditions exist</p><p>3.  That they would be prioritised for inspection by Local Authorities in the immediate future to ensure compliance with the Nitrates Regulations</p><p>4.  That assessment of overall on-farm storage capacity could be part of that inspection process</p><p>5.  That the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would subsequently contact the farmers to ascertain and record the date(s) on which this additional spreading takes place. </p><p>Subsequent Local Authority inspection reports will be returned to my Department and will be shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and those farms needing to avail of this flexibility will become a priority category for inspections in future years.</p><p>I am satisfied that the concerns regarding farmers' inability to spread slurry within the required timeframe have been adequately dealt with in a proportional and sensible manner.</p></reply>

These costs include temporary emergency accommodation for families. </p>  <p>  Given the current level of homelessness in the midlands, comprising 67 adults and 47 dependents, which represents 1.36% of the national total, and having regard to the fact that the midlands region's percentage drawdown of national funding has averaged at 1.27% over the last three years, I do not consider that the region receives a disproportionate allocation.  </p>  <p>  However, as is the case with all regions, I can assure the Deputy if further funding is required for homeless services in the midlands region, I will consider the matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-26a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102600070#WRA01800"><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. My Department does not have a role in relation to operational issues, such as placements into emergency accommodation, which are a matter for the relevant housing authorities.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query, I am aware that Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) staff are available on a daily basis to meet with newly homeless persons, as they present to the Central Placement Unit. On presentation, the DRHE will make an initial assessment with regard to the homeless person or household&rsquo;s accommodation options and will arrange temporary accommodation, as required.  Those that have presented previously can access the Homeless Helpline until 1am nightly, where their options and possible need for temporary accommodation will be assessed.  When a family presents out-of-hours, the dedicated Family Homeless Action Team will work with them to secure hotel accommodation for the night, following which a more detailed assessment of their requirements takes place the next day.  </p>  <p>  If it is the case that commercial accommodation cannot be accessed late at night, contingency accommodation and arrangements for families are in place but are intended for use only as a last resort when all other options that night have been explored. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of households in emergency accommodation will be met through a range of social housing supports, such as the HAP scheme and through general social housing allocations. In addition, housing authorities are delivering custom-developed facilities, referred to as family hubs, which offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability and more coordinated needs assessment and support than is possible in hotel accommodation. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the continued level of homeless presentations, considerable progress is being made in securing long-term accommodation solutions for individuals and families in emergency accommodation. Over 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies were achieved in 2016, and this accelerated further during the first half of 2017 when over 2,000 such exits were achieved. Securing long-term sustainable housing solutions for homeless households will continue to be the subject of priority attention.</p></reply>

These include the  streamlined planning system for large-scale housing developments; reduced development contributions; the &euro;226 million LIHAF funding, the impact of Rent Pressure Zones and changes to apartment guidelines in 2015.  <b></b></p><p>It also took account of the additional housing affordability measures contained in Budget 2018. As announced, there will be a second phase of the LIHAF infrastructure fund with an Exchequer contribution of &euro;50 million to unlock additional lands for housing. I also secured funding to put in place a new serviced sites fund of &euro;25 million specifically to deliver affordable housing on local authority sites. The new Home Building Finance Ireland fund is also of importance in terms of addressing the costs of delivering housing as it  will provide finance at commercially competitive rates to developers. </p><p>The review is now at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to outline the outcome,  including any additional measures, in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Also &euro;5,000 is disregarded for each member of the household up to 18 years.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions governing the schemes were examined in 2013 by a review group that included representatives of grant beneficiaries and the local authorities. They considered how the benefits of the grants could be spread as widely as possible and to achieve fairness and value for money in the grants process. Arising from the recommendations of the review group, the income requirements for the schemes were revised in 2014 to bring the criteria in line with the assessment of need for social housing and to focus the grants towards those with the greatest needs. I have no plans to further revise the criteria at this time.  </p>  <p>  My main focus  in respect of these schemes is in seeking to spread their benefits by further increasing the funding. For 2017, funding has been increased by a further 6% to &euro;59.8m overall. Some 8,000 households benefitted under this Scheme in 2016, and with this additional funding, this should increase to 10,000 in 2017. A further increase in funding will be provided in the 2018 allocations.</p></reply>

These schemes provide social housing support for households already living in the private rental sector and for households who require long-term assistance with their housing needs, by allowing them to increase their income without the risk of losing their housing support. Under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment, therefore putting their housing security at risk. </p>  <p>  Rent Supplement continues to be paid by the Department of Social Protection to those who are already in the private rented sector but who, because of a short term change in their circumstances, such as loss of income through unemployment, require a short-term income support to pay their rent. These applicants would not generally require an assessment of housing need and the expectation would be that a return to employment would obviate the need for long-term support. Thus Rent Supplement would return to being a short-term income support, as originally intended. Rent Supplement is a matter for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold a per day breakdown of the costs of HAP and RAS due to variations in costs related to a variety of factors including contractual agreements, household size, and locations. However, a detailed breakdown of the annual cost of each scheme per year for both RAS and HAP is available on my Department's website. In summary, the average monthly payment to landlords under RAS, across all areas and all  household sizes, was just over &euro;700 in 2016. In relation to HAP, the average monthly payment to landlords at end Q2 2017 was just under &euro;690.</p></reply>

It is evident that the long-term solution to the current homelessness crisis is to increase the supply of new homes, across all forms of housing, to 25,000 per annum by 2020. Over one year into the plan, all of the key statistical indicators point to a significant scaling up of home building activity with planning permissions, commencement notices and ESB residential connections all on the increase.  With over 19,000 households having had their social housing needs met in 2016,  I expect that a further 21,000 such supports will be delivered in 2017. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), there are currently more than 28,500 households being supported by the scheme and over 14,500 of these households commenced HAP support since the beginning of 2017; more than 350 households are being set up on HAP each week in 2017. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of households in emergency accommodation will be met through a range of social housing supports such as the HAP scheme and through general social housing allocations.  Progress is being made with over 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies being achieved in 2016, while over 2,000 such exits were achieved during the first half of 2017. </p>  <p>  In addition to the actions outlined above, housing authorities are delivering custom-developed facilities, referred to as family hubs, which offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability and more coordinated needs assessment and support than is possible in hotel accommodation.</p></reply>

I am committed to developing a more robust method of capturing house completions and improving the data that is currently being recorded as they relate to newly constructed homes.  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department and the Central Statistics Office (CSO) are continuing to work with the ESB to identify and supply to the CSO a more detailed dataset on connections which can be used to estimate the number of new builds.  Good progress has been made on this issue, which is technically complex. Once the detailed ESB data is received by the CSO, they will require a period of time to review and analyse it by matching it to other datasets, and to build a methodology for estimating and tracking new builds, based on the best available data. This project is advancing well and all parties are committed to its further progression as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has established a Housing Data Analytics Group, with membership from the CSO, ESRI, Central Bank, local authorities and others, to examine this complex area and to monitor and review the various sources of data collected nationally, with the aim of providing a comprehensive and coherent suite of statistics relating to housing matters.  This Group is due to hold its fourth meeting next month.</p></reply>

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additional housing at considerable scale and more affordable price points, with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals. On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 of those projects under LIHAF. The total cost of these projects is &euro;226.5 million, of which &euro;169.7 million is to be funded by the Exchequer, with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.8 million. These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.  </p>  <p>  Westmeath County Council submitted two projects for consideration under LIHAF.  Funding was approved for an access road in Brawny Road, Athlone in the amount of &euro;1.83m.

Accordingly, my Department has streamlined the nine stages of project review under the CWMF to just four stages.  Where project designs and, in particular, costs are consistent, the reviews by my Department are straightforward and completed on a timely basis. This process allows local authorities to forward design proposals and costings to my Department sequentially, as they advance projects through the planning process.</p><p>My Department also has regular informal technical dialogue with all local authorities to resolve issues with projects, which allows for projects to be moved from concept to completion, as efficiently as possible. My Department's role in reviewing projects represents a very small proportion only of the time taken in advancing a social housing build project onto site.  Furthermore, the time taken for approvals will always depend on the quality and completeness of the initial proposal, the scale and complexity of individual projects and on the avoidance, where possible, of cost escalations in projects. </p><p>As well as streamlining the approvals process under the CWMF and enhancing the direct technical dialogue between my Department and the local authorities, under Rebuilding Irelanda review of the project approvals process for social housing has been undertaken; this is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The recommendations of this Review are now being implemented and a working group, comprising representatives of local authorities and my Department, will soon finalise new project approval and development timelines.  Additionally, my Department is working with local authorities to encourage greater take-up of the available options under both 'Design and Build contracts' through the Rapid Delivery Framework, set up by the Office of Government Procurement and, for smaller projects (less than 15 units and less than &euro;2m), greater use of the available single-stage approval process, which may suit less complex projects.</p></reply>

The Review, available at the following link: , explored the impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  Key changes include:</p><p>- Lenders are now required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme. </p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow has been increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment/ townhouse in these areas has been increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house has been increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment /townhouse to &euro;210,000 (from &euro;190,000). </p><p>- Flexibility has been provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household now allows for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible. </p><p>- The administrative process has been streamlined, including certain steps of the MTR process now being required to be completed prior to the submission of a completed MTR application to the Housing Agency.</p><p>-  There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies are being facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  </p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5m for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by Approved Housing Bodies working together with lenders using the existing MTR scheme.</p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the MTR scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots and to establish the operability of an alternative financing approach, a targeted market testing exercise has been undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a MTR cohort, taking account of the necessity to provide a long-term stable solution for eligible households.  </p><p>The responses to the market testing exercise have been reviewed by the Housing Agency and my Department.  A call for Expressions of Interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models has been initiated by the Housing Agency today.  Once the Expressions of Interest process is concluded, the Housing Agency will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilots, which can then be initiated.</p></reply>

This is complementary to actions already undertaken to streamline the planning process, reform development contributions, and invest some &euro;226 million in enabling infrastructure, through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), to facilitate housing delivery.  </p><p>On 27 April 2017, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. Details in relation to these sites can be viewed at the following link: . </p><p>As the vast bulk of the land bank is under the control of the housing authorities and given their broader role as planning authorities, they are crucial in operationalising social and affordable housing delivery from their sites. Therefore, in order to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach nationally, I have asked local authorities to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for housing lands in their ownership with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the most potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term, including mixed-tenure projects, where appropriate. </p><p>Importantly, local authorities are working to deliver a major social housing construction programme, encompassing 700 social housing construction projects which will provide some 11,000 new homes.  Many of these projects are being advanced on local authority owned lands, and will produce a substantial quantum of new social housing in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>In the first instance, the final development model for each site, including the tenure mix, will be the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, including its elected members.  The procurement and tendering arrangements for the development of its sites is also matter for the local authority, who are required to publicly advertise to procure the services of interested contractors and developers.</p><p>The procurement for the development of a number of major local authority sites for mixed-tenure type housing is already underway. For example, South Dublin County Council is working to deliver approximately 900 social and affordable homes at Kilcarbery, Clondalkin on a 70:30 private and social housing proportional basis.  In addition, Dublin City Council is advancing plans to redevelop a major site on the former O'Devaney Gardens lands off Infirmary Road. It can deliver nearly 600 homes, with a breakdown of 30% social; 20% affordable purchase; and 50% private. The Housing Agency is also in the process of finalising plans for the development for one of their sites at Enniskerry Road. It is expected that other State-owned sites will be brought forward in the near future.</p><p>In terms of broader State and semi-State lands, the CIE-owned Ceannt Station site in the centre of Galway city and lands at Connolly Station, Dublin have both been master planned and brought to market, seeking partners to develop the site for residential/commercial purposes.  CIE is also working with my Department and the relevant local authorities regarding other sites in their ownership in Dublin and Limerick. I am also aware that lands owned by Galway Port are in the final stages of being master planned and Coillte are currently in the planning process in respect of land at Galway. Finally, the Department of Education is working with my Department regarding the optimal use of its surplus land bank. </p><p>My Department is continuing to work with all local authorities and State bodies to ensure that, where appropriate, housing is delivered from publicly owned sites that are strategically located, serviced and available for development.</p></reply>

These amenities are an integral part of the functioning and attractiveness of our communities and they provide a vital resource for sports and recreation activities. The Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas Planning Guidelines, issued by my Department in 2009, emphasise the importance of the role of open space in achieving quality residential neighbourhoods, where a wide variety of open space and recreational amenities are provided. </p>  <p>  However, in certain limited circumstances, there may be a case for examining the functional and amenity value of certain areas of undeveloped land that may now be inappropriately zoned as open space because of practical factors such as prevalence of anti-social behaviour in areas that suffer from poor passive surveillance. I understand that this was the main issue raised recently by the Chief Executive of Dublin City Council.  Such sites may be capable of use for smaller infill housing schemes which enhance local amenities without detriment to established and nearby public open spaces. Such proposals to amend local land use zoning objectives would, in any case, be considered by the elected members of the local authority as to the balance they strike in terms of securing orderly development, housing delivery and provision of local community open space facilities.</p></reply>

There are currently more than 28,500 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 20,000 landlords or agents currently in receipt of HAP payments. A weekly average of 350 HAP tenancies have been set up during 2017.</p>  <p>  HAP is also an essential component of our suite of homelessness prevention and supports. The Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme has been operational since February 2015 across the four housing authorities in the Dublin Region, and is being implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE). The focus of this pilot scheme is to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. A Place Finder service, similar to the service available in Dublin, became operational in Cork City Council earlier this year and provides a dedicated resource that operates together with the established HAP delivery team in the local authority. The Cork Placefinder Service seeks potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless by Cork City Council by establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords and liaising with individual households to establish their specific needs; and also supports homeless households in securing the tenancy arrangements which may include assisting with tenancy agreements and arrangements in that context. More than 2,000 formerly homeless households are currently having their housing needs met through this targeted support.  On average, 33 homeless households each week in the Dublin region alone are securing rental accommodation as a result of the additional supports available through the dedicated Place Finder Service. </p>  <p>  I announced recently that the Place Finder support is to be rolled out nationally providing homeless support staff in each of the 31 local authorities with the tools to target HAP supported rental properties for homeless households, with a particular focus of moving families out of emergency accommodation. This means that every local authority will be able to pay deposits and advance rental payment on behalf of homeless households in order to secure accommodation.  The existing Place Finder service in Dublin is also being enhanced, with additional staff to be assigned to provide on the ground support in each of the relevant  local authority areas. Arrangements for the provision of these supports are currently being progressed by my Department together with the local authorities and I envisage that the Place Finder service will be operational nationally by end year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 has seen a doubling of the total allocation for HAP to over &euro;300 million, which will enable an additional 17,000 households to be supported and accommodated in 2018, as well as meeting the 2018 costs of  households already supported by the scheme in 2017 and in previous years, as well as supporting the roll-out of the HAP Place Finder Support Service across the country.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. In general, I am satisfied with the operation of HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

The resulting increase in supply on both private and public lands is key to tackling price and affordability as the lack of supply is one of the main factors currently inflating house prices.</p>  <p>  As required under the LIHAF scheme's criteria and conditions, local authorities were asked, inter alia, to obtain commitments from housing providers on associated sites in relation to housing delivery timelines and cost reductions.  Local authorities were asked to ensure that an agreed cost reduction was included in the agreements on the approved sites to ensure that there is a proportionate dividend for the State&rsquo;s investment in infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities have used a range of mechanisms to meet the affordability commitment, tailored to the individual circumstances of each proposal. In some instances, the local authority itself owns the lands and consequently has a high degree of control in terms of ensuring delivery of a portion of units at affordable prices and on those sites, local authorities will be providing extra social housing over and above the 10% required under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p>  <p>  Where land is owned privately, providers of housing have entered into an undertaking with local authorities where, in recognition of the early delivery of the necessary public infrastructure, those providers have undertaken that housing will be delivered in accordance within an aligned timeframe of construction and with agreed cost reductions to be taken off the market price.  This can be an agreed cost reduction across all units or a larger cost reduction across a specified number of units. </p>  <p>  I have asked the Dublin local authorities to seek to provide as much affordability as possible on related sites. However, under the criteria originally set out in LIHAF, the expectation is that cost reductions will be delivered to make housing more affordable than would otherwise be the case, as opposed to requiring that housing be priced under a certain ceiling. The cost of building in Dublin is high relative to other parts of the country, driven primarily by high land costs and the viability of private developments would have been affected by any unrealistic ceilings or price capping, whereas the approach being taken is designed to promote supply, while achieving a cost reduction that is proportionate to the investment in public infrastructure and provides a benefit in terms of both the overall market effect of increased supply.  In certain cases, the cost reductions will be aggregated and spread over a smaller number of units to deliver a greater cost reduction and, in those cases, those units will be targeted at key societal groups that may be impacted or priced out of the market.</p>  <p>  To date, I have signed grant agreements for 22 of the 34 proposals which received preliminary approval and I will shortly publish further details regarding the approved LIHAF projects on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The WSSP committed to the preparation of Business Plans by Irish Water to set out targets for delivery of efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure and performance targets consistent with the delivery of the objectives of the WSSP. </p>  <p>  The Irish Water Business Plan - Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 was published in late 2015. It set the priorities for the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector to a single utility model. The plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review. The Water Services Bill 2017 contains provisions for the establishment of a Water Advisory Body (WAB). The WAB  is being established to advise on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water. The body will report on a quarterly basis to an Oireachtas Committee on the performance of Irish Water on the implementation of its business plan.</p>  <p>  The Confidence and Supply Arrangement in support of the minority Government has confirmed the retention of Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership, responsible for the delivery of water and waste water services.  </p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the local authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date. Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives. Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility. Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end, and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model. The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions, of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances. It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). </p>  <p>  A process of engagement with local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced. The SLAs between Irish Water and local authorities have not been amended and remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.</p></reply>

In Budget 2018, I secured &euro;1.9 billion for housing programmes, a 46% increase over 2017. This investment will ensure that over 25,000 households will have their housing needs met next year. </p><p>In addition to the significant increase in funding for 2018, I also secured a further &euro;500m for investment in social housing in 2019-2021. The investment secured will allow for an increase in the overall level of social housing to be delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under Rebuilding Ireland by a further 3,000 homes, increasing the overall target for social housing delivery under Rebuilding Ireland from 47,000 homes to 50,000, with the total funding envelope increasing from &euro;5.35 billion to over &euro;6 billion. </p><p>AHBs are tasked with making a significant contribution to the overall delivery of social housing in the years ahead, through a range of delivery mechanisms and funding programmes provided through local authorities and my Department, including the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF). As it stands, roughly one third of the new supply of social housing is predicted to be developed by AHBs in the period to 2021. Joint working and collaboration at local level between local authorities and AHBs is critical to achieving this ambition. There are already a number of mechanisms in place to assist AHBs to realise their potential and deliver on their commitments including the recent establishment by the Housing Agency of a dedicated AHB Services Unit.</p><p>My Department continues to support and work with local authorities to develop their major housing development sites. At this point, all the sites have been mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland website, and all local authorities are in the process of finalising and submitting strategic development plans for their respective land bank for review and further consideration. It is expected that opportunities for additional AHB partnerships will be identified as part of this process.</p><p>My Department publishes comprehensive status reports on a quarterly basis of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas, showing details such as their locations and a range of information relating to their advancement. The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of quarter 2 of 2017; it contains information on construction schemes right across the country delivering 11,000 new social homes - currently approved and progressing through planning, design, construction. The report, which can be accessed at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>This includes details of projects involving more than 4,500 new social houses to be delivered by AHBs.</p><p>In terms of access to land to underpin further delivery, clear engagement will be required between local authorities and AHBs in order to ensure that opportunities are taken to match available public lands with AHBs having capacity to bring forward projects. Local authorities are currently finalising management plans for the housing lands in their ownership, providing the vehicle for ensuring that such opportunities are realised.  In addition, AHBs can continue to pursue projects through turnkey arrangements on private lands.</p></reply>

The Nitrates Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.</p>  <p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission when Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was introduced.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice. The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of the on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme run by Teagasc has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the current closed periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters. A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters during the winter and the current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are highest. Farmers are advised to spread slurry early in the season when growth and nutrient uptake are at their peak.</p>  <p>  Ireland is currently negotiating a new NAP with the European Commission and, while we are now at a critical juncture in those negotiations, I am hopeful of a positive outcome. Each member state's negotiations with the Commission take account of the particular circumstances in the individual member state and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the details of the Nitrates Action Programme in Northern Ireland or in any other member state.</p></reply>

Officials of my Department have held discussions with DG Competition on the potential difficulties likely to be encountered by Irish firms from the Brexit referendum result, with the most recent meeting taking place this week. I also informed Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, of these issues when I met him in Brussels on 10th July 2017.  These discussions will continue at the highest levels to address all relevant issues relating to any proposals emerging from our work with industry.</p>  <p>  I recently announced a Brexit Loan Scheme, which will provide affordable working capital financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to SMEs and Small Mid-Caps.  The scheme will be open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. </p>  <p>  The total cost to the exchequer will be &euro;23 million. My Department will contribute &euro;14 million, the Dept. of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will contribute &euro;9 million. SBCI will use this budget to leverage the overall fund of up to &euro;300 million.</p>  <p>  My Department is also scoping the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  The State aid implications of the potential longer term are being worked through.

Officials of my Department have held discussions with DG Competition on the potential difficulties likely to be encountered by Irish firms from the Brexit referendum result with the most recent meeting taking place this week. I also informed Michael Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, of these issues when I met him in Brussels on 10th July 2017.  These discussions will continue at the highest levels to address all relevant issues relating to any proposals emerging from our work with industry. </p>  <p>  The Government is conscious of the need to consider the types of supports that Irish businesses may require across all regions of the country, to address challenges arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU.  Short, medium and long term responses from market diversification through to price repositioning will be needed. </p>  <p>  On foot of extensive engagement with industry, my Department is working with the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and the SBCI to develop appropriate, tailored and targeted responses. This work, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, and ongoing engagement with the business community, will inform further discussions with the Commission and the development of any further initiatives to business. </p>  <p>  I recently announced a Brexit Loan Scheme, which will provide affordable working capital financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses. </p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to SMEs and Small Mid-Caps.  The scheme will be open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. </p>  <p>  My Department is also scoping the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment.  Further details of this scoping exercise will issue in due course.</p>  <p>  A lot that can be done within the existing EU State Aid Framework. We are confident that the measures currently in development will be State Aid compliant, and we are taking steps to ensure that we can use all options available under the State aid framework to provide support to companies impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing rules, we will move quickly to advance this with the EU Commission.</p></reply>

Although the company continues to operate there, IDA Ireland is nevertheless actively promoting the site to existing clients and potential investors and will continue to do so in the time ahead. This entails engaging with suitable multinational companies - including those currently based in Ireland and others considering situating here - about the possibilities for investment in Leixlip.  Given the attractiveness of the HP Inc facility, and its location, I remain hopeful that a new investor will be identified in due course and that further employment opportunities will in turn be created for the people of Kildare and the surrounding region. </p>  <p>  While HP Inc's decision is very disappointing, there are over 20 other multinational companies in Kildare that employ more than 10,000 people across a broad range of sectors.

In addition, with the advent of the network of Local Enterprise Offices, Enterprise Ireland now plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. </p><p>In January 2017 Enterprise Ireland published its strategy for the period 2017-2020. The strategy was developed in the context of Brexit and despite economic and market uncertainties, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategic aims are to:</p><p>Assist clients to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and to sustain the existing record level of jobs;</p><p>Grow annual exports by &euro;5bn to &euro;26bn per annum;</p><p>Increase the level of spend in the Irish economy by &euro;4bn to &euro;27bn per annum by 2020, thus creating further jobs indirectly in the local economy.</p><p>The 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland and are spread across a wide range of sectors.  In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 201,108 people. Within this, 19,244 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,117 jobs.  65 per cent of client employment is outside of Dublin.  42.2 per cent of client employment is outside the five counties which are home to the five urban centres (Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Cork). The contribution of Enterprise Ireland client companies to the domestic economy is very important, particularly from a regional perspective, as it sustains over 300,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland collects employment data by county only and therefore cannot report on employment figures specifically for Ballina.</p><p>In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Mayo employed 3,856 people.  <b>Table 1</b>below presents employment at Enterprise Ireland supported companies for the period 2014 -2016.</p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th><div>County   Mayo</div></th><th><div>2014</div></th><th><div>2015</div></th><th><div>2016</div></th></tr><tr><td>Total Job Number</td><td>3784</td><td>3667</td><td>3856</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent   Full Time Gains</td><td>220</td><td>139</td><td>247</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent   Full Time Losses</td><td>-147</td><td>-196</td><td>-36</td></tr><tr><td>Permanent   Full Time Net Change</td><td>73</td><td>-57</td><td>211</td></tr></table></p><p>(Source: DBEI Annual Employment Survey 2014,2015 and 2016)</p></reply>

The data available shows that progress is being made towards achieving this goal, with 173 site visits recorded in the first quarter of this year.  This is an increase of over 20% on 2016, when 136 visits were recorded for the same period.</p><p>While visits by the Agency&rsquo;s client companies are a useful tool in promoting particular locations, the final decision as to where an investment may ultimately be situated is dependent on an array of factors. This includes the suitability of infrastructure and proximity to transport hubs. Another key consideration for IDA Ireland clients in this context is the ready availability of suitable properties. The Agency therefore requires an adequate supply of marketable serviced land and buildings that can be offered to investors. If the Agency did not have such properties available for investment, it would diminish Ireland&rsquo;s ability to win mobile FDI, particularly for the regions</p><p>The following table sets out the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits to each county over the course of the first six months of 2017.

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.   In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services must be charged to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within particular categories of goods and services specified in the VAT Directive. VAT rating is determined on the basis of particular goods and services, not by goods or services as a whole.</p>  <p>  The 9% reduced VAT rate, which was introduced from 1 July 2011 as part of the Government Jobs Initiative, applies to a number of services including those provided by hairdressers and barbers.  This is provided for under Annex III of VAT the Directive.  There is no provision that would allow a reduced VAT rate to apply to wedding bands.</p>  <p>  There is no legislative basis that would allow private individuals to reclaim VAT in the circumstances outlined.  VAT is a tax charged on goods and services by businesses who are registered for VAT but ultimately VAT is paid by the end consumer.  VAT-registered businesses who are charging VAT are entitled to claim back VAT on their inputs, but individual persons who are not registered for VAT are not entitled to claim back VAT.</p></reply>

The nine model schools operate as denominational Catholic or Protestant schools in accordance with the historic traditions that go back to their foundation and the community to be served at the time they were established.</p>  <p>  Religious education is one of the seven curricular areas of the Primary Curriculum (1999). Denominational schools are currently required to allocate thirty minutes per day for religious instruction. However, unlike other subject areas, the content of the religious curriculum provided by schools is not set by my Department. The Education Act recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This means that the content of the religious education programme in a particular primary school is determined by the patron of the school. </p>  <p>  Community National Schools (CNS) are multi-denominational schools under the patronage of Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  &lsquo;Goodness Me, Goodness You&rsquo; (GMGY) is the patron&rsquo;s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of CNS schools. GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none. GMGY is taught in all of the Community National Schools. </p>  <p>  Post Primary ETB and Community Schools are multi-denominational schools and as such are required to provide for religious instruction according to the profile of the students who attend the school. My Department is preparing a circular that will provide guidance to ETB Post Primary schools on the arrangements that should apply in future for students that wish to opt out of religious instruction or worship. I expect the circular to issue later this year and that it will also apply to Post Primary Community Schools in all of which ETBs are co-patrons.</p></reply>

My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:  </p><p>- 63% of students to attend  mainstream schools </p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and </p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:  </p><p>- S/he has ASD </p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,302 for the 2017/18 school year. 1,042 of these are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes of which 151 are being newly established for this school year.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>While it is not always possible to ensure that a special class placement will be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, including those in the Counties to which the Deputy has referred are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>in county order, and with new classes identified. </p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints. </p>  <p>   Under the current broadband access Programme my Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. All post primary schools have broadband speeds of 100Mbs or more. In relation to the primary school sector, significant improvement has been made in recent years with the number of primary schools with speeds of greater than 30mbs  increasing from less than 100 in 2012 to over 1000 by the end of 2017.  </p>  <p>  The need to further improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interDepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and my Department and in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision. </p>  <p>As the deputy is aware the National Broadband Plan is a Government wide initiative to deliver high speed broadband services to all businesses and households across Ireland.   Under the National Broadband Plan, the government has committed to intervening to ensure high speed broadband is available in parts of the country where commercial providers alone will not provide the essential services. This commitment to intervene will ensure that no school is left behind.</p></reply>

Additional funding for the development of technological universities has also been secured in Budget 2018</p><p>I announced on 16 October a significant capital investment programme in Institutes of Technology, to be delivered by Public Private Partnership (PPP).  I am pleased that major new buildings in both WIT and IT Carlow will be included as part of this Programme.  The WIT proposal relates to the construction of a new engineering, computing and general teaching building.  The IT Carlow proposal relates to the construction of a new science building. Both projects will be the subject of ongoing technical appraisal and economic analysis to ensure value for money is achieved.</p><p>I am confident that these new buildings will greatly enhance the physical infrastructure available to the Institutions in areas of key skills needs, and will support their joint bid for Technological University designation.</p><p>My Department is also supportive of the proposed acquisition by IT Carlow of a site in Wexford for development of a new purpose-built campus.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-26a.268.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102600074#WRE07000"><p>The Department of Education and Skills supports a comprehensive and whole-school approach in schools to well-being promotion and positive mental health focusing on the entire school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified need.  This spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student well-being.</p>  <p>The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) provides a framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct them to new practices as appropriate. They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social and emotional learning. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.   </p>  <p>  The key messages in the Guidelines are that: </p>  <p>  - Schools play a vital role in providing a protective environment for young people which can counter risk factors.    </p>  <p>  - Having a whole school approach which fosters important links with the wider school community, and agencies which support schools, is key to successful implementation of the Guidelines </p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the DES support services and other external agencies and support services. </p>  <p>As stated the   Guidelines form a framework within which a broad range of existing processes and practices can be rationalised within schools. Support for the school community in this regard is provided by a number of sources within my Department including the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT).</p>  <p>  Within my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education in 2016/19 mental health and well-being is afforded a high priority and is one of the key goals. The actions relating to well-being and mental health include supporting schools to implement the national Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) through: </p>  <p>- Introduction of a well-being programme at Junior Cycle:   Guidelines on Well-being in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015.   Introduction of the well-being guidelines to post primary schools was initiated in September 2017.   </p>  <p>- Increasing the capacity of NEPS  : an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.  The focus of this additional support, in the context of post-primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools in the Friends programmes. This programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people. </p>  <p>   In addition psychologists provide support to schools in implementing Student Support Teams in Post Primary Schools (2014) and Responding to Critical incidents Guidelines and Resource Materials for schools (2016). </p>  <p>- Enhancing Guidance Counselling Provision at post-primary level: Recent budgets saw improvements in guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017 together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 400 guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts).  The 400 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently and once again</p>  <p>A Well-being Steering Committee  , within my Department, continues to examine issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to both primary and post-primary schools in regard to well-being and mental health promotion.</p>  <p>  Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or Agency has been prioritised by Government. Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Pathfinder Youth Mental Health Project is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects to strengthen the prioritisation, management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies and ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. </p>  <p>In addition my Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government and is represented on this Taskforce.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to promoting well-being and mental health is of course the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies/services/NGOs involved. The Task Force was established to produce a series of action focused recommendations to improve youth mental health and well-being. The main areas of focus comprised: emotional literacy and reduction of stigma; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports across different settings; alignment of services and supports across different providers; and building capacity in local communities.  The report has been passed by the Secretary General of the DOH and approved by the Minister. It is intended to submit a memorandum for Government shortly.</p></reply>

Teachers are provided with further CPD in the years following the introduction of the subject specification.</p><p>I am not aware of issues that would preclude the delivery of training as communicated to schools. The number of teachers that have now registered with JCT stands at over 31,000 which reflects the fact that teachers in all post primary schools are now in a position to avail of the training and resources offered by JCT. It is intended that all teachers registered with JCT will be offered CPD during the current school year.  There is provision within current arrangements to respond to unforeseen events and schools are kept informed in this regard.  </p><p>A comprehensive programme of CPD will be delivered to teachers during the current school year as follows:</p><p>1. Whole-school support and CPD aimed at whole staff in schools. </p><p>2. Subject specific CPD in the form of school cluster events. This is where some 6 to 10 schools close to students on the same day and all subject teachers come together in host schools for training purposes. Each cluster this year will involve some 14/15 subject specific CPD workshops</p><p>3. Level 2 Learning Programme (L2LP) CPD workshops are provided for mainstream school teachers via the school cluster CPD events. L2LP CPD is also provided in the special school sector upon request. An L2LP workshop aimed specifically at school leaders was provided in various locations nationwide during Sept 2017.</p><p>4. Dedicated CPD workshops are provided in education centres nationwide for school leaders, one in the autumn and one in the spring.</p><p>5. JCT has a strong online and social media presence. Live webinars are set to be broadcast across all subject areas in the coming year.</p></reply>

Historically some ETB schools also made provision for religious instruction required for pupils from local Protestant communities. Depending on their future pupil composition as multi-denominational schools, ETB second level schools may have to make provision for religious instruction for those from other minority religions should it be required. </p>  <p>  It is important that schools consult with parents and in the case of pupils who have reached the age of 18, the pupil, to find out what their wishes are in respect of participating in religious instruction and worship. This practice should also apply to the parents of pupils already enrolled in the school and not just those seeking admission for the first time.</p>  <p>  Schools engaging with parents, or pupils where appropriate, should at the outset of the school year clearly indicate what arrangements are in place for those who chose not to participate in religious instruction.  The outcome of this engagement should be integrated with the school&rsquo;s processes for establishing subject choices generally. Instead of waiting for a parent to request a withdrawal and then having to make alternative arrangements for the pupil for the class periods concerned, pupils who do not chose religious instruction should be timetabled by the school for alternative subjects.</p>  <p>  Societal change with a decrease in religious belief and practice requires change in school practice and the circular will address how those who wish to withdraw must be catered for in future.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to issue the circular later this year and that it will also apply to Community Schools in all of which ETBs are co-patrons.</p></reply>

With this in mind, Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the U.S. are continuing to systematically avail of all opportunities to raise the immigration issue in their contacts with the US authorities, including the prospects for immigration reform and the situation of the undocumented.   We do not, however, underestimate the size of the challenge. </p>  <p>  This policy area has been a deeply divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with a problem which directly affects over 11 million people. </p>  <p>  The Government has always tried to work with both parties in a bipartisan way to address our longstanding concerns and this continues to be our approach.  </p>  <p>  During my visit to New York for the UN General Assembly in September, I met with representatives of the four Irish Immigration Centres in the region and a representative of the US-wide Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres.  It gave me the opportunity to hear from those working at the coal-face with the undocumented Irish as to the current situation and the problems they are encountering on the ground. </p>  <p>  In addition, I met with a senior State Department official and used that opportunity to once again impress on the US administration the importance which the Irish Government attaches to a resolution of the plight of the undocumented Irish.</p>  <p>  I was able to further emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this issue when I travelled to Washington DC from 3 to 5 October and met with senior members of the US administration and with members of Congress.</p>  <p>  I was pleased that Deputy John Deasy, the Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, who was appointed by the Taoiseach to that position last June, was able to accompany me to those meetings.  His appointment was another important statement of our intent and seriousness on this issue.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Taoiseach raised the issue when he spoke with President Trump by phone shortly after taking office and I know that the Taoiseach looks forward to having an opportunity to discuss this important issue with President Trump in more detail in due course. </p>  <p>  There can be no doubt, then, that the Government remains wholly committed to working with the US authorities to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish.  The Government will continue to articulate to the US authorities our keen interest in this area while respecting the right of the United States to set its own immigration policies.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to pursuing these matters on behalf of our affected citizens in the US, and our continued openness to routes and policies that will provide relief for the undocumented.</p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington DC, and our six Consulates across the US, continue to work continuously with Irish Immigration Centres in order to provide vital services to the undocumented in the United States.</p>  <p>  Legal advice on the implications of policy developments for undocumented Irish citizens in the US, funded by my Department, has been disseminated amongst Irish Immigration Centres in the United States and is available online.</p></reply>

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.  </p>  <p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of deprivation of liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015. </p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that ratification of the UNCRPD remains a very high priority for me as Minister. </p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his statutory functions and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard. Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and the levying and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. This has been the policy of successive governments and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office. The Valuation Acts provide for revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value over time due to changes in economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date. </p>  <p>  With regard to property used in the horse training and wider equine industry, I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation that there has been some apparent confusion in media reports as to the rateability of certain elements of the sector. The Valuation Act 2001 (Schedule 3, Sections 1(a) and (b)) provides that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose, are rateable. The basic premise under the Act is that all interests (including buildings) and all developed land are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. I am advised that the only element of the equine sector which satisfies the exemption provisions in Schedule 4 is the breeding of horses. Buildings used for breeding of horses are classified as being of agricultural use and are "farm buildings" as defined in the Act. Therefore, these buildings are exempted from the payment of rates under paragraph 5 of Schedule 4.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, buildings used for the training of racehorses, recreational equestrian purposes or livery premises are rateable under the Act because they are considered to be part of a commercial enterprise and are not exempt under the provisions of Schedule 4. Such buildings would typically include stables for horses, covered riding arenas, tack rooms and ancillary buildings used to support the enterprise. It would appear from the details supplied with the Deputy&rsquo;s question that the activities being carried out in this instance would not be exempt activities and so the properties in question would be deemed rateable under the Valuation Acts.</p>  <p>  While acknowledging the important contribution which the equine sector makes to the economy, there are no plans to reclassify buildings and lands used for training of horses from being rateable to being exempt from rates. To do so would be at variance with the provisions in the Valuation Acts which maintains the long-standing position that property occupied and used for commercial enterprises is liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other equally important services, which would be difficult in equity to resist. This could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p></reply>

Every non-national arriving to the State by sea or air is required to present to an immigration officer and is required to produce a valid identity document or passport.</p>  <p>  Passenger arriving by air or sea will have some interaction with an immigration officer. Most of these contacts are informal or routine requests to establish the purpose of entry to the State and are not necessary to record. The Deputy will also appreciate that given the volume of passengers arriving in the State (14 million at Dublin Airport in 2016) that it simply is not feasible to record all such interactions.</p>  <p>  Immigration Officers operate in accordance with the relevant law. In the case of persons seeking entry to the State who are nationals of an EEA Member State or qualifying dependants, this is set out in Regulations which transpose the EU Freedom of Movement Directives. For non EEA nationals, the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004 relating to permission to enter and be in the State are applied.</p>  <p>  In relation to Irish nationals, once an Immigration Officer is satisfied that the person is an Irish citizen that person is of no further interest from an immigration perspective and is free to continue. </p>  <p>  A non EEA national who is admitted to the State will have his or her passport endorsed with a permission to enter stamp indicating purpose and duration of stay. A decision to refuse a non EEA national permission to enter the State is recorded and the person concerned provided with a written notice setting out the grounds for the decision. </p>  <p>  Immigration officers receive comprehensive training as part of their induction. This includes modules on dealing appropriately and in a culturally sensitive way with passengers and the wider human rights context in which immigration officers carry out their duties.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-10-26a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017102600075#WRF04400"><p>I have sought a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the issues raised and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the report is to hand. I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  However, I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  </p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime. It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017. We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. </p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor. </p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 83,260 targeted checkpoints and 61,580 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 5,540 arrests and 6,150 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  </p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b></b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. </p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. </p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations. These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. </p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate in the Scheme can find more details at <i><i>www.muintiir.ie.</i></i></p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. </p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p></reply>

The Report was not carried forward by the Government of the day. The implementation of the Report at this remove, and the introduction of any legislation to enable the type of collective legal action envisaged, would require a detailed consideration of the merits and impacts in the public interest, including in terms of the sustainability of a collective action regime and its potential costs to the parties concerned and to the Exchequer. The areas of law involved include consumer protection, competition, the environment and the provision of financial and other services. Consideration would also have to be given to the relevant intervening developments that have taken place at the national, European Union and wider international levels. While not part of the current Legislation Programme, therefore, this remains a complex area of legislative reform that will require renewed and thorough consideration. As such, I will continue to bear it in mind for discussion and possible action in the general context of any upcoming reforms in the civil justice area.</p></reply>

A person who contravenes such a requirement may have committed an offence and if found guilty is liable under Section 13 of the Immigration Act 2004, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. </p>  <p>  In order to allow INIS make a full assessment of this case, both persons should be advised to write to Unit 2 - Residence Division, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 clarifying their current residency location i.e. are they currently residing inside or outside the State.  They should include a detailed explanation of their activities since the both last had permission to reside in the State, what their future plans are, and should also supply full copies of all passports, their marriage certificate, birth certificates of any children and work permits. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,412. There are also 607 Garda Reserves and more than 2,000 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, in the coming years.  </p><p>For the Deputy's information  I have set out below, as provided by the Commissioner, the number of Garda&iacute; assigned by rank as of 30 September 2017,  the latest date for which figures are readily available.<table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Strength on 30 September 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Commissioner</td><td>1  (Acting)</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Commissioner</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Commissioner</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Chief Superintendent</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Superintendent</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>Inspector</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>Sergeant</td><td>1896</td></tr><tr><td>Garda</td><td>11020</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>13,412</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As a consequence, National Museum of Ireland officials in consultation with officials from my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service, have carefully removed the visible remains for safekeeping. </p>  <p>  My Department is arranging for further archaeological investigations to be carried out which will help to both inform and contextualise the discovery. While it has been reported that the site might date to the Iron Age, this cannot be determined categorically ahead of the planned further investigations. The site itself will ultimately be entered onto the Sites and Monuments Record and will thus be protected under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004. </p>  <p>  I want to commend the local community for promptly reporting the matter and to thank them and  the local authority for securing the site, for preventing unwanted interference and for its co-operation with the planned further investigations that are about to take place.    </p>  <p>  This discovery also highlights the significant risks to our vulnerable archaeological monuments and historic buildings from extreme weather events. I am accordingly supporting the adoption, by the end of 2018, of a formal Sectorial Climate Adaptation Plan for Built and Archaeological Heritage which will identify risks and appropriate mitigation measures to help safeguard our heritage for future generations.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018. Budget 2018 allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;10m for the remainder of 2017 to fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures.</p><p>In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services.<font color="#001FE2"> </font>The Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan is being delivered through a combination of normal hospital activity, as well as insourcing and outsourcing initiatives utilising NTPF funding. Under the Inpatient/Daycase Plan, since early February, over 27,000 patients have come off the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List.  </p><p>The NTPF has  advised that to date 9,476 patients have been authorised for treatment in private hospitals under its Day Case Initiative, 3,415 patients have accepted an offer of treatment in a private hospital and that 1,499 patients have received their procedure. The NTPF has also indicated that 3,645 patients have been authorised for treatment in public hospitals under the Plan&rsquo;s insourcing initiatives, 1,310 offers of treatment have been accepted and 573 patients have been treated. </p><p>Under the Oupatient Plan, since early February, over 94,000 patients have come off the Outpatient Waiting List. </p><p>Under waiting list initiatives run by the NTPF, the NTPF liaises directly with hospitals to identify patients to be treated.

The incorporation of adjuvants into vaccine formulations is aimed at enhancing, accelerating and prolonging the specific immune response towards the desired response to vaccine antigens.  Advantages of adjuvants include the enhancement of the immunogenicity of antigens, modification of the nature of the immune response, the reduction of the antigen amount needed for a successful immunisation, the reduction of the frequency of booster immunisations needed and an improved immune response in the elderly and immunocompromised.</p>  <p>  Of the approximately 650 reports of suspected adverse reactions that were received by the Health Products Regulatory Authority and classified as serious, in the majority of these cases the medical care required was for the treatment of vaccination related events, such as fainting around the time of vaccination, or treatment for injection site reactions such as headache, rash, itching (or other allergic-type reactions), fever, muscle pain and gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting.  Such reactions are typically transient in nature and as such do not represent autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.</p></reply>

They found that, based on available evidence, none of the public access defibrillation programmes that were assessed were considered cost-effective using conventional willingness to pay thresholds. </p>  <p>  Following on from this, early this year, the Health Service Executive established an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Steering Group. The purpose of this project is to improve survival rates for those who suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest through the development and implementation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest strategy. This work will support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and Community First Responder Ireland (CFR Ireland) in their commitment to improve clinical outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). </p>  <p>  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland are working with other partners to enable a sustainable response to such events.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Community First Responder framework for Ireland declared that CFRs offer a valuable and complementary resource to emergency ambulance provision, positively impacts NAS response time and achieves improved survival for OHCA. It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework. Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them. It also aims to:</p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators;</p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public; and</p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.</p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups. These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area. They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.</p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD. Both the NAS and CFR Ireland currently support over 145 Community First Responder schemes throughout Ireland, who train community members to provide emergency care support.</p>  <p>  If an emergency 999/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details. The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.</p></reply>

An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.</p>  <p>  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the Health Service Executive are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition. The removal of wax by ear syringing is also considered to be comprehended by the GMS contract if the removal of wax forms part of the "proper and necessary treatment" required by an eligible patient. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy and ear syringing services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes they have been incorrectly charged for routine services by their GP, or the practice nurse on behalf of their GP, they should contact their Local Health Office, who can investigate the matter in accordance with the HSE complaints policy.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve clarity on these issues, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy and ear syringing services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p></reply>

Where this is not possible, the Health Service Executive supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.</p>  <p>  I am familiar with the particular research referred to by the Deputy, and he will be aware having met with me on the day that I was present at its launch in September. The report documents the views, likes, dislikes and wishes of persons living in our nursing homes. </p>  <p>  I believe that it is fundamentally important that residents' rights and dignity are respected and valued and that their views are listened to and acted upon. The significant role that a nursing home fulfils in the provision of a &ldquo;home from home&rdquo; for its residents must be recognised and acknowledged. Residential services for older people should be person-centred and I am convinced that older people should be the driving force in the design and delivery of those services which are provided to them.  Their voices and views should be listened to and they must be allowed play a meaningful role in shaping their own homes and communities.</p>  <p>  This is, for example enshrined in the "National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland" (2016) developed by HIQA. The standards inter alia provide a framework for service providers for the continual development of person - centred services. Standard 1.3 outlines that residents have a right to exercise choice and have their needs and preferences taken into account in relation to services. </p>  <p>  In relation to ageism in a broader context, the National Positive Ageing Strategy, published in 2013 provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens. Combatting ageism is one of the cross cutting objectives of the strategy. Revised arrangements for the implementation and monitoring of the strategy were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform in October, 2016. The first National Positive Ageing Indicators Report was published in 2016 and is available on the Department's website. Earlier this year the Department facilitated the inaugural stakeholder Forum under the NPAS. The forum provided an opportunity for stakeholders to work collaboratively and to identify key priorities. Those stakeholders have been facilitated with an opportunity to directly engage with relevant Departments in relation to those identified priorities. The Department of Health intends to follow up with the stakeholders in relation to their experience, towards the end of the year.</p></reply>

Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the HPRA or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of quality, safety and efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of medicinal product authorisation. </p>  <p>  All pharmaceutical companies seeking marketing authorisations for their medicines must provide evidence in a dossier which includes information from pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing and testing data. The format of the dossier and type of data to be submitted is laid down in EU and national legislation and guidelines. Authorisation thereafter is made on the basis of initial and continuing benefit versus risk balance for specific therapeutic indications, having regard to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product for the proposed conditions of use.</p>  <p>  The Summary of Product Characteristics for each medicine includes detailed information on the use, dosing recommendations, precautions for use, and the known side-effects of the medicine concerned.  Information on the research data submitted to the competent authority is included in a number of sections, particularly section 5.1. The summaries for all products are accessible from the HPRA website (www.hpra.ie), including those for the statins authorised in Ireland, namely atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, which are authorised under a range of brand names and in various strengths. The package leaflet for patients reflects the information described in the summary, but is required to be presented in an abbreviated and easy-to-read format.</p></reply>

Since Healthy Ireland was launched in March 2013, my Department has launched the following health and well-being initiatives:</p><p><i>- The National Sexual Health Strategy 2015 - 2020;</i></p><p><i>- Tobacco Free Ireland - Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group;</i></p><p><i>- The National Positive Ageing Strategy;</i></p><p><i>- Get Ireland Active - National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland;</i></p><p><i>- A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan;</i></p><p><i>- The National Healthy Cities and Counties of Ireland Network; and</i></p><p><i>- Healthy Food for Life - The Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid.</i></p><p>It is not possible to identify in totality how much funding is currently spent on improving health and well-being across all Government Departments and agencies and in wider society. </p><p>Since the launch of Healthy Ireland, expenditure on its implementation from within the budget of the Department of Health has amounted to the following:</p><p>2013 - &euro;89,315;</p><p>2014 - &euro;586,470;</p><p>2015 - &euro;607,706.83;</p><p>2016 - &euro;1,156,405; and</p><p>2017 - &euro;922,109.</p><p>In addition to the expenditure noted above, other expenditure arising within the Department could also be described as &quot;Healthy Ireland&quot; depending on classification. </p><p>Separate to the expenditure detailed above, the Government, in July 2016, approved the creation of a Healthy Ireland Fund and subsequently provided an initial allocation of &euro;5 million in Budget 2017 to kick-start its establishment. The Fund was announced by An Taoiseach on Monday the 2 of October 2017.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund will help drive the cross-governmental approach as set out in the Healthy Ireland Framework to improve the mental and physical health and well-being of the population.  The main aim of the Fund is to support innovative, cross-sectoral, evidence based projects, programmes and initiatives that support the implementation of the key national policies in areas such as Obesity, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity and Sexual Health.  In particular the Fund will be for projects and programmes aimed at children and young people and their families, and supporting communities and vulnerable groups who are at most risk of experiencing health inequalities. </p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund is managed and administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department and a further &euro;5m has been made available for the Fund in Budget 2018.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, operational responsibility for the delivery of specific initiatives promoting health and well-being by the health services is a matter for the HSE. Expenditure arising in the HSE, particularly in the Health and Well-being Division, could also be described as implementation of Healthy Ireland. However, it is not possible to disaggregate expenditure on promoting and improving health and well-being generally from overall HSE expenditure. Again, for example, within overall HSE expenditure, and in addition to work which is an integral part of the Health and Well-being Division, a large component of health promotion and improvement work takes place across the acute and primary care services as part of normal day to day activity. There is also expenditure arising in relation to communications campaigns by the HSE.</p></reply>

A critical requirement for the successful establishment of the Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance. This has involved continuous ongoing dialogue between the Experts and third parties throughout this initiative. The Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidance, which will be finalised shortly. The Expert Group are also considering other operational aspects for the implementation of the Access Programme.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation to underpin the programme and on the logistics of sourcing suitable cannabis-based product supplies for the Irish market place. This work will take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Misuse of Drugs legislation it is open to the Minister for Health to grant a license to an Irish registered medical practitioner for access to medical cannabis for a named patient. The granting of a licence is based on submission of an application to the Minister which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of treatment over time. To date two such applications have been successful.</p>  <p>  Ultimately it is the decision of the prescribing clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe any particular treatment, including cannabis, for a patient under their care. </p>  <p>  Applications received by the Department of Health are assessed without delay. Any consultant who requires further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process may contact the Department of Health directly.</p></reply>

Psychiatry is a specialty where there are significant worldwide shortages and international competition for our doctors and nurses. </p><p>The HSE has been focused on increasing the number of front-line staff over the past two years as the budgetary position has improved and progress has been made in growing the consultant, NCHD and nursing workforce. While there are difficulties in filling posts in certain specialties, including psychiatry, the number of consultants employed in the public health system continues to increase year on year. At the end of August 2017 there were 2,913 whole time equivalents consultants in the public health service, an increase of 101 compared with the end August 2016<b></b>and an increase of over 700 in the past decade. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly. At the end of August 2017 there were 6,209 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 278 compared with the end of August 2016 number and an increase of over 1,100 in the past decade.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff stood at 36,278 in August 2017; this is an increase of 739 whole time equivalents in the past 12 months, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives. </p><p>Recruitment of nurses and midwives is a key priority this year. The HSE have committed to offering permanent contracts to all graduate nurses, including mental health nurses. These contracts are being offered as part of the 2017 Nursing and Midwifery Agreement, reached with the INMO and SIPTU. This Agreement has a particular focus on addressing recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery posts. It has committed to put in place an additional 1,224 nursing and midwifery posts across the public health service by the end of December 2017.  This Agreement followed an agreement with the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU in summer 2016 that also includes a range of measures aimed at improving psychiatric nursing staffing levels. Very extensive and detailed work has been sustained throughout 2017 to implement these Agreements.  </p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident, including psychiatry. The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018. The outcome of its assessment will be subject to discussions between the relevant parties.</p></reply>

It is a clinically led change programme which is technology enabled.  It is intended that it will improve the delivery of diagnostic laboratory medicine, healthcare quality, efficiency and outcomes for patients in the Irish healthcare system. The existing laboratory systems, as with all digital systems, constantly require upgrading and maintenance. A number of currently deployed laboratory systems required hardware, operating system and database upgrades in 2014 and 2015 to ensure that they would operate safely  and be supported by the vendors of the system. These laboratory systems were deployed in the 1990&rsquo;s and have been upgraded several times in that time frame. The costs of these upgrades, which were mandatory, are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Upgrade Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>&euro;115,325</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;394,990</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;494,696</td></tr><tr><td>Navan</td><td>&euro;238,553</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;418,618</td></tr></table></p><p>The strategic goal for the MedLIS Project is to ensure Irish healthcare providers have 24-hour access to complete and up-to-date accurate laboratory data across all sites.  The project will replace all of the laboratory systems throughout the country and is being supported by technology teams from the HSE.</p><p>To achieve this goal, the HSE undertook a public procurement process for the supply of a national laboratory solution and Cerner Inc. were the successful bidders. The contract is a fixed price contract for the delivery of the Cerner solution replacing all the existing systems in the 43 HSE and Voluntary Laboratories with the Cerner Millennium system. All laboratory disciplines will be replaced including Biochemistry, Immunology, Endocrinology, Haematology, Microbiology, Virology, Histopathology, Cytopathology, Autopsy services, Blood Transfusion, Histocompatibility &amp;amp; Immunogenetics (tissue typing) and Molecular Diagnostics. It will also provide for the delivery of functional interfaces to multiple external systems, e.g., Order Communications Results Reporting, Patient Administration Systems, Healthlink and other national clinical systems, e.g., National Renal System.</p><p>Such a complex change programme has taken longer to design, test and implement than originally planned by both the HSE and Cerner. However, as the contract is a fixed price delivery contract the HSE does not incur any additional supplier costs due to schedule adjustments. The MedLIS project is primarily about patient safety and quality improvement of services being provided by the Laboratory Service.  As such it is critically important that the solution is delivered in accordance with the workflows designed to the Irish Laboratory requirements.  Schedule adjustments made now are done to ensure that the project will be fit for purpose, underpinning patient safety at all times and delivering a solution that is functionally beneficial for the Laboratory Service. The project is currently being closely monitored by the HSE project steering group and is on schedule to 'go-live' in St. James Hospital in Q2 2018.</p></reply>

The project started with the realisation that healthcare interaction in the future will ultimately be digital and it follows the strategic direction set out in the eHealth strategy for Ireland published in 2013. </p>  <p>Although the MN-CMS is primarily about the documentation and communication of mother and baby clinical information, there are a number of other components.  These include order communications (blood investigations, microbiological investigations, ultrasound, procedures) and drug prescribing. The MN-CMS project encompasses a wide range of stakeholders including  midwives, obstetricians, neonatologists, anaesthetists and others in both   the community and allied health specialties. Most importantly, the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System aims to help put the patients at the centre of the care plan.</p>  <p>The programme is a large, complex business change and technological project. The system went live in Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH)  in December 2016 and the Maternity Unit in University Hospital Kerry in March 2017.  Integration between the GP&rsquo;s ICT system and the MN-CMS in the Cork region is due to commence on the 31st   October. Following successful sign-off of the integration, it will be deployed to all GPs interacting with the Maternal &amp;amp; Newborn Clinical Management System.</p>  <p>  As with any large-scale change programme there are lessons to be taken from the initial deployment and continuous process improvements to both the IT system and the workflows. Healthcare deployment of technology must always ensure that patient safety considerations are to the fore.  The improvements are currently being deployed into both existing hospitals and the next hospitals due to implement the MN-CMS are the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital. I can confirm that the HSE have informed me that the Rotunda Hospital is due to go-live with the MN-CMS in November 2017 followed by the National Maternity Hospital in early 2018 and subsequently to all the remaining Maternity Hospital Units.</p>  <p>  The changes brought about through the implementation of the MN-CMS have had a positive impact on the hospitals who have deployed it.  The MN-CMS has brought about improvement in the management of patient information, patient safety and the communication between clinical teams. It has led to standardisation of information collection and in the future will lead to standardisation of care. Its future success will depend on a positive multi-disciplinary approach and a determination to be part of setting new national and international standards.</p></reply>

After this meeting the Commission sought additional information which was provided and a further meeting is planned in November 2017. To support Ireland&rsquo;s position, my Department, in consultation with the sector, produced  Land Types for Afforestation (March 2016)  and following a public consultation process also produced  Environmental Requirements for Afforestation (December 2016).  Ireland&rsquo;s position is that these documents combined ensure that only both productive and non environmentally sensitive land is planted in the absence of the 20% rule.</p></reply>

These contacts will continue.</p>  <p>  Prior to the dissolution of the Northern Ireland Assembly in January 2017, I met with Michelle McIlveen (DUP), the then Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, on a number of occasions to discuss the impact Brexit could have on the agri-food sector. These included more formal engagements in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC), such as those in Armagh in October 2016 and at the Plenary in November 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have hosted four All-Island Civic Dialogue events since last December, for thirteen different agri-food sectors under the Department of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s All Island Civic Dialogue process. The Northern Ireland agri-food sector has been very strongly represented at these events. In all of these engagements we discussed the severe implications that Brexit could have for cross border agri-food trade in particular, and the potential steps that could be taken to mitigate its impact.  </p>  <p>  All of the information gathered at these events has fed into my Department&rsquo;s preparations for the forthcoming negotiations as part of the EU 27 negotiating team.</p>  <p>  The Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and I will continue to press Ireland's case for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures. </p></reply>

In this context the Department of Transport introduced new regulations to provide for the introduction of compulsory testing of tractors used for commercial road haulage purposes. These regulations, in the form of  statutory instrument No. 413 of 2017, specifically relate to Category T tractors with a maximum design speed exceeding 40km/hr and operating at a distance exceeding 25 km from the address at which the owner ordinarily resides or carries on business. It is understood that the legislation is not intended to apply to tractors used by farmers in the course of carrying out their normal farming activities but rather applies to commercial road haulage activities. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, convened a forum to examine any technical points arise in the implementation of the regulation. Stakeholders across the agricultural sector, including officials from my Department, are represented at this forum and have the opportunity to present their views on relevant issues.</p>  <p>  I will forward your correspondence to my colleague, Mr. Shane Ross TD, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as Minister with responsibility for vehicle testing.</p></reply>

As outlined in the Energy White Paper, Government policy is to ensure that policy choices impacting energy costs are evidence-based with a focus on competitiveness, cost-benefit, security and sustainability.The electricity and gas markets are commercial and deregulated operating within national and European regulatory regimes. I have no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of gas or electricity prices. </p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is an independent statutory body.</p><p>At a national level, the deregulated energy market results in choices for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices.  I would encourage consumers to either switch supplier or to contact their current supplier to ensure that the best available deal is being provided. Two CRU approved websites, and , are very helpful in aiding consumers to choose the products that best suit their needs and assisting them to switch energy suppliers.</p><p>CRU carries out statutory market monitoring functions and has the responsibility to ensure the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer. It also conducts regulatory scrutiny of the network costs component of retail prices. </p><p>Energy efficiency supports also represent a significant opportunity for consumers and businesses to reduce their energy costs. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) provides the policy framework for energy efficiency in Ireland. Energy efficiency supports are available via the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), to assist both business and domestic energy consumers, with significant funding allocated to them.</p><p>In the recent Budget, I secured approximately &euro;107 million in capital funding for energy efficiency schemes in 2018, a 34% increase on the 2017 allocation. The capital increase will allow the SEAI to support the expansion of energy efficiency schemes. This will mean that 28,500 homes will be upgraded, including 9,000 low income households, and that bills for homes and business will be reduced by approximately &euro;26 million, with 483 gigawatt hours of energy saved and 120,000 tonnes of carbon emissions saved.</p></reply>

In April, eir signed an agreement with me committing them to follow through on their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .</p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k roll-out will be published on my Department's website available at http://www.dccae.gov.ie/documents/County%20Statistics.pdf  which includes a full set of county statistics.  eir has confirmed to my Department that 101,000 premises have been passed as at the end of September 2017.  The 300,000 figure includes c.7,800 premises in County Cavan and c.4,600 in County Monaghan.  eir will continue to roll-out high speed broadband to the remaining premises including those premises in Counties Cavan and Monaghan as part of this Agreement between now and the end of 2018.Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at  http://fibrerollout.ie/eircode-lookup/  </p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.This map finalises the State Intervention Area for the procurement process and shows the extent of  the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services. Individuals can search the map by entering their eircode/address.</p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services and includes eir&rsquo;s  planned 300k rural deployment depicted Light BLUE </p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will be part of the State led Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. </p><p>The position in relation to the areas referred to by the Deputy is set out below:</p><p>There are c. 42,000 premises in County Cavan, of which c17,000 will benefit from the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining c25,000 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes the c7,800 premises that fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).</p><p>There are c33,000 premises In Co Monaghan, of which c16,000 premises will benefit from the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining c17,000 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes the c4,600 premises that fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map). </p><p>My Department is engaged in an on-going procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out the new high speed broadband network for the State led intervention. A significant milestone in that process was reached in September with the submission of &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by two bidders, This is the last stage before receipt of final tenders and progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s). The timeframe for completion of the State Intervention procurement process is dependent on a range of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders.</p><p>To improve both mobile and broadband services in rural Ireland in advance of the roll-out of the high speed broadband network to be built in the State intervention area I established, in July 2016, a Taskforce to identify solutions which can be implemented in the short, medium and long term to alleviate mobile phone and broadband coverage deficits, to identify priority areas for roll-out and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers. These solutions will enhance the existing services prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State led intervention. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

As outlined in the Energy White Paper, it is Government policy to ensure policy choices impacting energy costs are evidence-based with a focus on competitiveness, cost-benefit, security and sustainability. The electricity and gas markets are commercial and deregulated operating within national and European regulatory regimes.  I have no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of gas or electricity prices - that is the responsibility of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent statutory energy regulator. CRU is responsible for ensuring the market operates competitively for the benefit of the consumer. At a national level, the electricity and gas retail markets provide choice for consumers, including businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices.  I would encourage consumers to switch supplier or to contact their current supplier to ensure that the best available deal is being provided. Energy efficiency offers very significant potential for business to reduce their energy spend and enhance competitiveness. There are already a range of supports available to large energy users and to SME's and information on these is available on the SEAI website at .</p><p>In addition, I have secured significant additional resources for energy efficiency in Budget 2018. &euro;14m will be used to enhance energy efficiency supports for the commercial sector in 2018. To ensure such funding continues to meet the needs of commercial energy users, my Department is currently engaging with business organisations through an open public consultation. Details are available on my Department's website at <i></i>. The consultation is open until 3 November. </p></reply>

This involves the maintenance, improvement and technological upgrade of the network. As a commercial body, EirGrid is not funded by the Exchequer and therefore, not subject to the PAC. This position applies to all commercial state bodies under the remit of my Department.    EirGrid is regulated in its activities by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities(CRU), the independent regulator for the sector. The CRU has the role of approving the overall level of investment in transmission infrastructure. It approves expenditure on the transmission grid when EirGrid submits its Transmission Development Plan, which outlines EirGrid&rsquo;s plans for transmission network development on a five-year rolling basis, to the CRU for approval. The entire capital expenditure for 2017 for example is regulated and is consistent with the multi-annual allowance as provided in the relevant regulatory determinations.</p></reply>

Currently there are three different points in the year - September, January and April.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2018, the ECCE programme has been expanded further so that all eligible children can avail of a full two programme year. There will also only be one enrolment point each year (i.e September). However, I must advise the Deputy that these will not come into effect until September 2018. </p>  <p>  An upper age limit in free pre-school was set by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment on the advice of the Department of Education and Skills. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs does its best to ensure, in so far as is possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner.  The rules for all the Department&rsquo;s childcare schemes are clearly published to ensure transparency and consistent application. An essential component of the scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  For the programme year 2017/2018 parents may request an exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria under limited circumstances from my Department; specifically where a diagnosed special and/or medical need exists. This must be supported by a letter from a relevant medical specialist, recommending additional time in pre-school. However, please be aware that my Department is currently reviewing the overage exemption process. I would urge the parents of the child in question to contact my Department to enquire about such an exemption.</p></reply>

As of 30th September 2017, project expenditure amounting to &euro;140,106.25 had been drawn down.  </p><p>Progress has continued in October, with over 400 projects now fully approved for LEADER grant aid of over &euro;10 million.

The most recent CSO figures for Consistent Poverty indicated that 2.6% of women over 65, and 2.9% of men over 65, are in consistent poverty, which is less than a third that of the general population.  Eurostat figures also show that men and women over 65 are less likely to be at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland than in the EU as a whole, with the gap in outcomes between men and women being significantly narrower in Ireland than most countries. </p>  <p>  I intend to publish a Pensions Reform Plan by the end of this year.  The aim of the planned reforms will be to establish a sound and fit for purpose overall pension system for the coming decades, one that is sustainable and which will shape the retirement landscape to the benefit of our retirees for generations to come.  One of the main components of that Plan will be the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach for the contributory pension to replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from about 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very big change and there are a lot of legal, administrative, and technical elements to put in place before it can be done.  Its aim is to provide as fair a basis as possible for the calculation of contributory pensions while removing the anomalies of the existing system.  Key to the design of this new approach will be the position of women who have gaps in their contribution records as a result of caring duties. </p>  <p>Officials in my Department are currently examining data from the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which was finalised recently.  Following completion of this analysis, it is intended to have a public consultation on this reform, and this will provide an opportunity for people to submit their views on the priorities in this reform. Following this consultation process, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made to the Government.  This, in turn, will result in legislation being prepared for consideration by the Oireachtas.   </p>  <p>As regards the specific matter of the post-2012 rate bands, I have asked my Department to prepare a report for me on the issue as soon as possible to see what options are open to improving the outcomes for those whose contributory entitlements are lower as a result of that change.  I will be bringing the report to Government as soon as it is ready.  However, the Deputy should bear in mind that the cost of simply reverting to the rate bands from 2000-2012 would be very expensive, would generally increase payments to better-off pensioners with additional means, and would reduce resources available to the broader group of pensioners.  The recent Budget contained increases to the rate of the payment for pensions would not have been feasible if such a reversal of the 2012 changes had also been included, and that would have impacted negatively upon the most vulnerable pensioners, including those with no additional means, and widows and widowers living alone with only one pension payment.   </p>  <p>  It should be remembered that, where somebody does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they will generally qualify for an alternative payment, unless they have significant additional means.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult amounting up to up to 90% of a full rate pension, which is based on their own means and is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested non-contributory State pension which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate, based on a household means test. </p>  <p>Most pensioners would satisfy the means tests for these two payments, and the very large majority of people paid them receive the maximum rate.  Therefore, it would seem that those in receipt of SPC payments at a lower rate are among the better off pensioners who have significant additional means, over and above state supports.   </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension will be extended to the self-employed from December 2017.   </p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the Class A rate of 4%. In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.5% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.5% or 14.75%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits. </p>  <p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18th October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.   </p>  <p>The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.   </p>  <p>As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.   </p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020. By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state. </p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. </p>  <p>The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner. It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.   </p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors. It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory. </p>  <p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of state pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI. Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.   </p>  <p>  The projections provided in the 2015 actuarial review are based on the system of social insurance, currently in legislation.  It therefore reflects the fact that social insurance applies on a compulsory basis and not on the basis of allowing contributors to opt in at their own discretion. </p>  <p>  The issue of whether social insurance cover for the self-employed should be made on a compulsory or voluntary basis was addressed in the third report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare published in 2013.  The then Advisory Group was charged with examining extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The group considered that allowing people a facility to opt in or out at their own discretion could lead to the selection of bad risks. </p>  <p>  The fundamental principle of social insurance is social solidarity. Everybody contributes and, if needed, cover for contingencies is available.  Allowing people to opt in or opt out could result in a negation of the social solidary contributory principles which underline the system. In addition, it would be likely to mean that a higher contribution would be required from those who opt in on a voluntary basis.</p></reply>

The Programme also references some specific issues to be considered such as the concept of directly elected mayors in cities, devolution of new powers to local authorities, reducing the size of local electoral areas, and town council status. </p>  <p>  Work on the report is at an advanced stage.  The process of consultation with relevant stakeholders, as required by the Programme for Partnership Government, is under way and I hope to be in a position to have a report available for consideration by Government in the coming weeks.

These include the streamlined planning system for large-scale housing developments; reduced development contributions; the &euro;226 million LIHAF funding, the impact of Rent Pressure Zones and changes to apartment guidelines in 2015.  <b></b></p><p>It also took account of the additional housing affordability measures contained in Budget 2018.  As announced, there will be a second phase of the LIHAF infrastructure fund with an Exchequer contribution of &euro;50 million to unlock additional lands for housing.  I also secured funding to put in place a new serviced sites fund of &euro;25 million specifically to deliver affordable housing on local authority sites.  The new Home Building Finance Ireland fund is also of importance in terms of addressing the costs of delivering housing as it will provide finance at commercially competitive rates to developers. </p><p>Cognisant of the crucial role land plays in the delivery of affordable housing, my Department is taking a very active role in State land management.  At this point over 2,000 hectares of public land has been mapped and all local authorities and the Housing Agency have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership.  My Department facilitated a workshop for local authorities in July 2017 to commence this process.  Once all the plans have been finalised and reviewed, they will be published. </p><p>Already, a number of major publicly owned sites have been brought forward for mixed-tenure development.  For example, South Dublin County Council is advancing procurement to deliver approximately 900 social and affordable homes at Kilcarbery, Clondalkin on a 70:30 private and social housing proportional basis.  In addition, Dublin City Council is advancing procurement to redevelop O'Devaney Gardens off Infirmary Road.

Ahead of the conclusion of this work shortly, a range of vacancy related actions have been initiated, details of which are set out in my reply to Question No. 278 of 19 October 2017.</p>  <p>  In relation to compulsory purchase order (CPO) powers, it should be noted that a large number of State bodies and authorities already have CPO powers, many of which are underpinned by different statutes.  Considering the number of statutes involved, the complexity of the various pieces of legislation, and the 2015 judgment by Supreme Court in respect of a case in Co. Kildare, any review of CPO powers will be a significant task and will require detailed legal input to appropriately balance the constitutional property rights against the wider public interest. </p>  <p>  In addition, the complexity of current statute law governing CPOs has been acknowledged by the Law Reform Commission which has begun a project on reform of the law of compulsory acquisition of land, as part of the Commission&rsquo;s current Fourth Programme of Law Reform.  This project will explore the consolidation, clarification and reform of the rules and principles on compulsory acquisition of land, with the aim of putting in place a fair, effective and efficient system.  Among the matters included in the project will be:</p>  <p>  - simplification, consolidation and codification of the law;</p>  <p>  - the principles for the assessment of compensation on the acquisition of land or interests in land;</p>  <p>  - time limits for implementation of a CPO; and</p>  <p>  - submissions from third parties whose land is not being acquired. </p>  <p>  The Commission intends to publish a consultative Issues Paper, which will describe the current law and seek views from interested parties through targeted questions around how the law might be reformed, in the coming months.  In this context, the outcomes of this LRC project will inform the assessment in my Department as to whether and what further review of CPO provisions is warranted.  </p>  <p>  Further to the above work being conducted by the LRC, and taking account of advice from the Attorney General, I also intend to engage directly with local authorities, who have practical, on-the-ground, operational knowledge and expertise on the CPO process within their own areas, and who may be able to identify practical measures or immediate legal reforms that could be taken in the short term to improve the existing processes.</p></reply>

This is a 46% increase over 2017 and will support the housing needs of 25,500 households. A large element, &euro;1.14 billion, is for the delivery of almost 5,900 social homes through a range of construction (5,000) and acquisition (900) programmes. The balance of the funding will add new tenancies and maintain existing ones through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and long-term leasing.  It will also fund other important housing supports and services in relation to homelessness, regeneration and programmes to upgrade existing housing (energy efficiency improvements, adaptation grants, housing for Travellers, pyrite, etc).</p><p>Additionally, I secured a further &euro;500 million for investment in social housing over the period 2019&ndash;2021, which will increase the overall level of social housing to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies by a further 3,000 homes.

To date, my Department's focus in relation to this form of house building has been on encouraging its use for accelerated delivery of social housing units and considerable progress is being made.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, my Department recently asked all local authorities, including Kildare County Council, to review the social housing projects in their areas and in the interest of achieving earliest delivery, they have been requested to consider their suitability for Design and Build contracts under the Rapid Build Framework, which includes modular design, set up by the Office Of Government Procurement. They were asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are amenable to early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.</p>  <p>  In response, some authorities have indicated that a number of approved schemes and new schemes under consideration may be suitable.  I expect that some authorities will utilise the OGP Rapid Build framework to help expedite delivery and I expect to be announcing further details in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The question of utilising rapid build methodologies and other innovative construction technologies is, ultimately, a matter for consideration by each local authority in the context of individual projects. As I previously indicated to the Deputy, my Department and I are working with local authorities and approved housing bodies to accelerate the delivery of all housing, including rapid build, in order to tackle the current housing waiting lists and to deliver homes, as quickly as possible, to those who need them.</p></reply>

The map also includes details of some 300 hectares of land in ownership of other State or semi-State bodies, with the potential to deliver a further 7,500 homes. </p><p>Details in relation to these sites can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest appropriate opportunity. My Department facilitated a workshop for local authorities in July to commence this process. Once all the plans have been reviewed and finalised, they will be made available publicly, both on the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland website as well as on the website of the relevant local authority.</p><p>Utilising Rapid Build and other innovative construction technologies can accelerate housing provision, as timeframes are considerably less than for traditional build. This form of house building is being encouraged for accelerated delivery of social units under my Department's programmes. Faster delivery may also mean the units can be provided at lower cost than traditional build, given that the latter may have significantly greater labour costs over the course of construction. The question of utilising Rapid Build methodologies for housing on local authority sites is, in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority in the context of each individual project.  </p><p>The rapid delivery programme has seen new social homes completed in Dublin at Poppintree, Ballymun (22 homes) and Finglas (39 homes). Other rapid delivery projects are nearing completion, including at Mulhuddart (20), Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot (24), Mourne Road, Drimnagh (29) and Belcamp (38), a range of other  projects are progressing, and a number of further additional projects are in planning, including projects outside Dublin. </p><p>I am keen that all local authorities advance their social housing construction programme as speedily as possible, using the optimum delivery mechanism and I have assured them that funding is in place to support their activity in this regard.</p></reply>

The latest report, setting out the position at end Q2 2017, is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>This report shows a sizeable construction portfolio for County Kildare, delivering over 280 new social homes. In fact, since the publication of that report, a further five new social housing construction projects, with 72 new homes, have been approved for the County.  </p><p>In addition to the permanent accommodation solutions that we are putting in place, I also recently opened a new family hub development at Athy, where the Council and the Peter McVerry Trust have delivered good quality, supported accommodation for 7 families who were experiencing homelessness. </p><p>In tandem with the construction programme, all local authorities have been undertaking the targeted acquisition of properties for immediate social housing use and so far this year, Kildare County Council has purchased over 80 such homes. Approved housing bodies (AHBs) are also very active in delivery in Kildare, as can be seen with the 45 new homes approved through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility and, over 2016/17, a further 100 new homes were acquired by AHBs for households on the Kildare social housing waiting list through the Capital Assistance Scheme. </p><p>In addition, between 2014 and the end of this year, around 100 vacant social houses in Kildare will have been returned to productive use through the programme of funding support from my Department.</p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme is also supporting local authorities and AHBs for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and developers for social housing use. Currently, there are around 375 operational units under this programme in Kildare.</p><p>Over 1,300 households are also being supported currently through the HAP scheme in Kildare. This will continue to provide a flexible housing support for addressing the housing needs of households presenting as homeless to Kildare County Council.</p></reply>

It is evident that the long-term solution to the current homelessness crisis is to increase the supply of new homes, across all forms of housing, to 25,000 per annum by 2020. Over one year into the plan, all of the key statistical indicators point to a significant scaling up of housing activity, with planning permissions, commencement notices and ESB residential connections all increasing substantially.  With over 19,000 households having had their social housing needs met in 2016,  I expect that a further 21,000 such supports will be delivered in 2017. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), there are currently more than 28,500 households being supported by the scheme and over 14,500 of these households commenced HAP support since the beginning of 2017; more than 350 households are being set up on HAP each week in 2017. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of households in emergency accommodation will be met through a range of social housing supports such as the HAP scheme and through general social housing allocations.  Significant progress is being made, with over 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies being achieved in 2016, and 2,000 further such exits being achieved during the first half of 2017. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Budget 2018 provides for a national allocation of &euro;116 million for homeless services - an additional &euro;18 million, or 18%, on this year's provision of &euro;98m, and a 66% increase on the 2016 provision of &euro;70m.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. </p>  <p>  Monaghan County Council has prioritised a new fire station project in Castleblayney and this is included as part of this programme under the list of priority projects to be progressed for 2019.
