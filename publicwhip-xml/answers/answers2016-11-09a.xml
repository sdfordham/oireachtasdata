    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-09a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900067#WRA00800"><p>Participation in EU Battlegroups demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the development of EU capabilities in the area of crisis management and contributes to our overall credibility within the Union.  Ireland&rsquo;s continuing active engagement in EU Battlegroups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, in particular, the role Battlegroups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN operations.  The United Nations strongly supports the development of Battlegroups as a capability that could be made available in support of UN mandated missions.  It also supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded States.  Participation in EU Battlegroups further supports Ireland&rsquo;s international security and defence policy and enhances our bilateral relations with contributing Member States.   </p>  <p>  To date Ireland has participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008, 2011 and 2015 as well as the Austro-German Battlegroup in 2012.  Ireland is currently participating in both the German led and UK led Battlegroups which stood up on 01 July 2016 until 31 December 2016. </p>  <p>  The total costs directly associated with Irish participation in EU Battlegroups between 2007 and 31 December 2015 amount to just under &euro;9.5 million, of which approximately &euro;6m is direct payroll costs which would have been incurred in the normal course.  The remaining &euro;3.5 million, relates to subsistence, allowances, transport, flights and other such costs incurred during the preparation and standby period for the Battlegroup.  In the time available, my Department has not been able to fully validate all the costs incurred.  Should the final figure which emerges be materially different, I will write to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The final figures for 2016 participation will not be known until after the German and UK led Battlegroup's stand down on 01 January 2017.   </p>  <p>  In respect of the German led Battlegroup, the current estimated additional cost for a maximum 120 day Battlegroup deployment, should the Battlegroup be deployed, is &euro;10.7 million.  This cost would cover transportation of troops and equipment, accommodation, overseas allowance and recovery of troops etc.  This additional cost will only arise if the German Battlegroup were to be deployed and any deployment of the Defence Forces contingent would be subject to Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval and a UN Mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts.</p></reply>

The expenditure for 2015 was comprised of some &euro;671m in Defence expenditure and &euro;227m in Army Pensions expenditure.</p><p>On the Defence Vote, some &euro;459m was expended on the pay and allowances of Defence Forces personnel, civilian employees and civil servants of the Department.</p><p>With regard to non-pay current expenditure, some &euro;123m was spent on essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.</p><p>The remaining &euro;89m in Defence expenditure related to capital investment on essential infrastructure and equipment.  The broad areas of capital expenditure in 2015 included the replacement of naval vessels in the Naval Service flotilla; ongoing investment in Defence Forces built infrastructure and the purchase of new and replacement Information and Communication Technology hardware.</p><p>The Defence Vote also included expenditure relating to the Reserve Defence Force, Civil Defence and a grant to the Irish Red Cross Society.</p><p>The Army Pensions expenditure of over &euro;227m provided mainly for retirement benefits to over 12,100 military pensioners and their dependants in 2015.</p><p>Defence is a critical element of Government policy, with the White Paper on Defence providing the policy framework for the next decade and beyond.  My priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces have the necessary level of resources required to fulfil all the roles assigned to them by Government and to facilitate investment in essential equipment and infrastructure, as identified in the White Paper.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-09a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900067#WRA01400"><p>It is important to state at the outset that I hold the members of the Reserve Defence Force in very high regard, as do all my colleagues in Government.  I have been hugely impressed by the work that volunteer members of the Reserve Defence Force undertake in their local communities in the context of Aid to the Civil Authorities during periods of flooding and other such events, and the pride and professionalism with which they carry out their numerous ceremonial duties especially throughout this year, the Centenary of the 1916 Rising.</p>  <p>  Members of the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve are volunteers who undertake training in their spare time.  Much of the training is unpaid.  However, provision is also made for members of the Reserve to avail of paid training.  In that regard, the overall budget available in 2016 is set at &euro;2.150 million, of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated to paid training of Reserve members.  This budget provides for 30,000 training mandays.  This allocation provides a minimum of 7 days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve.  It also provides for 14 days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve Defence Force in 2016 and for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve.  The allocation also includes provision for RDF participation in 2016 commemoration ceremonial parades and events.</p>  <p>  Members of the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve are not employed or engaged under a contract of employment.  A contract of employment stipulates the hours of work, hours of attendance or other related matters normally associated with the concept of gainful employment.  Furthermore, service with the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve is not pensionable under the Army Pension Schemes. For these reasons, it has been the long-standing policy that neither gratuities nor pensions are paid to members of the Reserve when they leave and there are no plans to change this position.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the situation regarding gratuity or pension payments to military reserve members in other jurisdictions. That is a matter for the relevant governments to decide upon, within their specific policy operational, budgetary and legal circumstances.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied with the current financial provision for the Reserve in terms of mandays allowance.  This allowance ensures that there are sufficient paid training opportunities available to members of the Reserve.  These training opportunities, in turn, allow Reserve personnel to fulfil the roles allocated to them, as set out in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-09a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900067#WRA01600"><p>The Government&rsquo;s 2015 review of foreign policy and the Defence White Paper reconfirmed that Ireland will continue to maintain its traditional policy of military neutrality which means non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality was formed in an era when inter-State conflict was the key issue of national security for most States.  The State&rsquo;s policy of remaining outside of military alliances has remained in place ever since.  Thankfully, the threat of inter-State war in Europe is much diminished, but there will continue to be new and emerging threats in the defence and security environment.  However,<b></b>Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality should not be confused with isolationism.  We may refrain from membership of military alliances but we are committed to international peace and security and our Defence Forces have stood robustly for this in many peacekeeping missions.</p><p>The issue of overflights<b></b>by foreign military aircraft and the use of Shannon<b></b>by foreign military aircraft are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  However, the Deputy will be aware that successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years.<b></b>These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US and are governed by strict conditions, applied to ensure compatibility with our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p><p>Finally, it goes without saying that all our policy responses must realistically reflect current and future security challenges and should be able to accommodate the necessary responses, both national and collective without prejudice to our policy of military neutrality.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p><p>The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.</p><p>All efforts are currently being directed at recruitment in order to return the Defence Forces to their approved establishment.  Regular competitions are held for recruitment of enlisted personnel, cadets and other staff.</p><p>To reduce the number of occasions an applicant must present in a military installation during a General Service competition, the Defence Forces are now conducting fitness tests and competency based interviews on the same day.</p><p>The following tabular statement (Table 2) sets out the extent to which the effective strength of the Reserve has fluctuated over the last ten years.</p><p>In terms of the Reserve, the 2015 White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the organisation.  It also provides that the overarching establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) is to be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army Reservists and for the expansion of the establishment of the four NSR Units from currently 200 personnel to 300.</p><p>A key challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the Reserve establishment provided in the White Paper.  I am committed to accelerating induction into the Reserve, in tandem with expanded recruitment into the PDF.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; PDF Strength Fluctuation</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Army </th><th>Naval Service </th><th>Air Corps </th><th>Total </th><th>Approved Strength </th></tr><tr><td>2006 </td><td>8532 </td><td>1082 </td><td>865 </td><td>10479 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>8512 </td><td>1077 </td><td>845 </td><td>10434 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>8507 </td><td>1070 </td><td>832 </td><td>10409 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>8095 </td><td>1031 </td><td>807 </td><td>9933 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>7752 </td><td>1032 </td><td>766 </td><td>9550 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>7650 </td><td>997 </td><td>791 </td><td>9438 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>7510 </td><td>1058 </td><td>791 </td><td>9359 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>*2013 </td><td>7434 </td><td>1023 </td><td>779 </td><td>9236 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>7457 </td><td>1057 </td><td>766 </td><td>9280 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>7309 </td><td>1083 </td><td>748 </td><td>9140 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to end Sept) </td><td>7247 </td><td>1079 </td><td>718 </td><td>9044 </td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><i>* Strength figures from 2013 on are Whole Time Equivalents</i></p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; RDF Strength Fluctuation</b><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Reserve Defence Force </th><th>Approved Strength </th></tr><tr><td>2006 </td><td>9134 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>8408 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>7671 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>6644 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>6083 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>5220 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>4978 * </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>3655 * </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>2302 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>2280 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2016 (to end Sept) </td><td>2095 </td><td></td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>* </i></b><i>2012 &amp;amp; 2013 &ndash; Due to the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force there is a significantly larger margin of error applicable to these figures.</i></p></reply>

This was an informal meeting and as such no decisions were made on any matter.  There was an exchange of views on the implementation of the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy (EUGS).  The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Frederica Mogherini, provided a progress report on the ongoing work of drafting an implementation plan on the security and defence elements of the EUGS, which is due to be presented to Member States at the Foreign Affairs Council, including Defence Ministers, taking place in Brussels on the 14th and 15th of November.  The Commission also provided an update on progress on the development of the European Defence Action Plan which is expected to be presented to Member States before the end of this year.</p><p>Ministers also exchanged views on the implementation of the Joint EU-NATO Declaration made recently at the Warsaw Summit, which highlights areas where the EU and NATO can undertake practical cooperation in support of international peace and security, international crisis management operations and the protection of civilians.  These areas include countering hybrid threats; broadening cooperation on maritime security and migration; expanding cooperation on cyber defence; developing coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities; facilitating a stronger defence industry and defence research; stepping up coordination on exercises and supporting countries in building their defence and security capabilities<i>.</i></p><p>There were also discussions on ongoing Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations with a focus on the Mediterranean Naval CSDP mission, 'Operation Sophia' and CSDP missions in the Sahel.  The situation in Libya was also briefly discussed.</p><p>There are no proposals to create a standing EU army and this did not feature in any discussions.  It is worth once again reiterating that <i>the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide for the creation of a European army.</i></p></reply>

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) where appropriate in accordance with the relevant EU procurement directives, including the Directive on the procurement of Defence and Security equipment.</p>  <p>  Such tender competitions are open to any individual company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions.  There are no such restrictions or embargos in place on Israel or Israeli companies.  Tender competitions are held in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct on Export Controls.</p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in the European Defence Agency since it was established in 2004.  The primary reason for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European Defence Agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing participation in the EDA is designed to enable the Defence Forces to participate in leading edge projects and have access to the latest technologies in relation to relevant military capabilities which will support their ongoing participation in international peace support and crisis management operations.  Ireland also supports the European Defence Agency in its role in the development of a more competitive and efficient defence industry which could reduce the cost of equipment procurement to the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Government's White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, states "Procurement approaches will be developed &hellip; through more robust planning, more collaborative/joint procurement through direct engagement with other countries or through the European Defence Agency&hellip;".  To date Ireland has not conducted any procurement through the European Defence Agency but my Department continues to explore potential opportunities that the Agency can offer.</p></reply>

Niamh and L.&Eacute;.  Samuel Beckett, and the deployment was completed on 29 November 2015.  During that period 8,592 people were rescued in the Mediterranean by Irish Naval Vessels.</p>  <p>  The Government, on 6 April 2016, approved the return of an Irish Naval vessel to undertake humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean. During 2016 there have been three Naval vessels deployed to the Mediterranean.  The L.&Eacute;. R&oacute;is&iacute;n was deployed from 1 May to 15 July and L.&Eacute;. James Joyce from 8 July to 30 September.  L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett was deployed on 23 September and will remain in the area of operations until the end of November.  To date in 2016 6,162 people have been rescued by Irish Naval Vessels.  In total, Irish participation in the humanitarian mission has resulted in the recovery of over 14,700 migrants, to date, which clearly demonstrates the value of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in this important humanitarian response.   </p>  <p>  Once the rescued migrants have been brought to the disembarkation points at the designated locations in Italy, the Italian authorities are responsible for the registration and identification of the migrants and for the processing of any applications made for asylum.  The European Asylum Support Office is assisting the Italian authorities in this regard. </p>  <p>  The question of further deployment to the operation in the Mediterranean in 2017 will be considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources.</p></reply>

It does not make any recommendations as to which chemoprophylaxis should be used but rather makes reference to the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Travel and Health Handbook for the latest information on malaria chemophylaxis. </p><p>The WHO Handbook provides for a range of anti-malarials which includes mefloquine (Lariam).  The WHO Handbook notes that there are specific contraindications and possible side-effects for ALL anti-malarial drugs. I am advised that the Defence Forces Medical Policy on the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis (including the use of Lariam) is in line with the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.</p><p>The choice of medication for overseas deployment for both officers and enlisted personnel, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.  Significant precautions are taken by Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for medical fitness for service overseas and medical suitability to be prescribed the necessary malaria chemoprophylactic agent.</p><p>There are three anti-malarial drugs, in use in the Defence Forces, Lariam (Mefloquine); Malarone and Doxycycline.</p><p>In the case of Doxycycline and Malarone, I am advised there are specific reasons as to why they are not the drug of choice for use by the Defence Forces on typical deployments in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p><b>Doxycycline </b>has to be taken in the absence of dairy products for maximum efficacy.  It can cause troublesome, mainly gastrointestinal side-effects, it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) in some individuals. This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes.</p><p><b>Malarone:</b>Up to September 2012, Malarone was only licensed for up to 28 days continuous use and was not an option as the usual duration of deployment for the Defence Forces is 6 months.  The 28 day limit was removed in September 2012.  However there is limited evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of Malarone usage for longer periods.  On this basis the Defence Forces policy, to use Malarone up to the 27 day limit, remains unchanged. It should be noted that the majority of Defence Forces deployments to sub-Saharan Africa are for periods exceeding 28 days.</p><p>In the context of a military environment, the dosing regimen is also a considering factor.  Lariam has the advantage of being taken weekly, minimising the dangers of a missed dose exposing the individual to contracting malaria.  Doxycycline and Malarone have to be taken daily. Missing a daily dose can expose the individual to higher risk of contracting malaria.  This is why Lariam is, in most circumstances, the drug of choice within the available options that minimises the risk of contracting malaria in sub-Saharan Africa where the predominant species of malaria is the virulent Plasmodium Falciparum.  However, it should be noted that in Afghanistan, Doxycyline is the anti-malarial chemoprohphylactic agent of choice where the predominant species of malaria is the less virulent Plasmodium Vivax.</p><p>In this context and having regard to the constraints associated with the alternative drugs, this is why we do not deploy personnel in the first instance who have shown a sensitivity or contraindication to Lariam to sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>However, if for operational reasons it was imperative that an individual deploy immediately without the normal &ldquo;lead-in&rdquo; time which is required for Lariam, or an individual who had previously demonstrated sensitivity to Lariam, or had a contraindication to its use, who had a specific skills set which was fundamental to mission success, then one of the other alternative medications would be used.  The risk to benefit ratio is a determining factor in recommendations from the Director of Medical Branch permitting use of these medications.</p><p>If during the course of deployment, an individual developed sensitivity to Lariam, he/she would be advised to cease taking the medication and substitute it with a &ldquo;second line&rdquo; chemprophylactic agent.  The individual would continue to be monitored and ultimately if serious enough, repatriation could be necessary.</p><p>Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. </p><p>There are no plans to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to the Defence Forces.  The use of and the information on medications is kept under ongoing review.</p></reply>

Future capability requirements for the Air Corps are being considered as part of the rigorous capability development and equipment planning priorities process as envisaged in the White Paper.  This will define ongoing and future equipment priorities having regard to the evolving security environment and available funding.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Air Corps fleet, this will include the replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The preparatory work for the tender competition has begun within the Defence organisation, and it is expected that the competition will be initiated by the end of this year.   </p>  <p>  There are no current plans, however, to upgrade or replace the current fleet of PC-9M aircraft purchased in 2004.  The fleet of PC-9 aircraft is expected to fall due for replacement in 2025.  The Pilatus PC 9 aircraft were obtained as trainer aircraft for the purpose of training pilots in the Air Corps.  They are capable of being armed and as such have a limited defensive capability.  However, these limitations were noted in the White Paper on Defence and the development of a more capable combat/intercept capability is to be considered in due course as part of the White Paper review process.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a decision was made recently to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft scheduled for delivery next year from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland at a cost of &euro;5m plus VAT will bring the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.</p></reply>

I am happy to provide the information to the Deputy again.</p><p>The health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a high priority for me and the Defence Forces.</p><p>Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa as reported by the World Health Organisation.  It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area.</p><p>There are three anti-malarial drugs, in use in the Defence Forces:</p><p>- Lariam (Mefloquine);</p><p>- Malarone; and</p><p>- Doxycycline.</p><p>The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.  That position has not changed.</p><p>  The Defence Forces Director Medical Branch issues instructions on matters of medical policy.  Current DMB Instruction No. 52 amendment No. 1, dated 24 August 2016 provides for Vaccinations and Other preparations for Overseas Deployments.  Paragraphs 5 to 8 deal specifically with the use of malaria prophylaxis and provides for the following:</p><p><i>5. Please note that the &lsquo;default&rsquo; chemoprophylaxis against Malaria, in Sub-Saharan missions and other areas where the predominant species is Plasmodium falciparum and where there is no evidence of resistance to it in the region, is Mefloquine (Lariam) 250mg weekly.  Mefloquine is the only &lsquo;once weekly&rsquo; medication currently available as a chemoprophylactic agent for Malaria.  The dosing regimen is particularly suitable for the deployed soldier, given that he/she has minimal control over the operational environment on a day to day basis, thus increasing the risk of missing a dose of a daily medication.  To be effective Mefloquine must be started two (2) weeks prior to deployment and should, if possible, be started four (4) weeks prior to departure in order to allow accommodation to minor and tolerable side-effects or to determine the appearance of intolerable side-effects or contraindications.  Where operational imperatives demand immediate deployment without any &lsquo;lead-in&rsquo; period, Mefloquine is not appropriate as a chemoprophylactic agent and one of the daily medications (Doxycycline or Malarone) should be used instead. All Medical Officers should familiarise themselves in detail with the contraindications and side-effect of all prescribed medications. To this end, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) website can be consulted.  Where an individual has an intolerance or sensitivity or contraindication to the use of Mefloquine, he/she should not be prescribed Mefloquine and should be &lsquo;stood down&rsquo; from that particular deployment.  In the event of there being no other person available within the Defence Forces with the particular skills set required for the mission, derogation may be sought from the appropriate authority to permit use of an alternative medication. As in all such circumstances the risk benefit ratio will become the determining factor in the recommendation from the Office of DMB to DCOS Sp.</i></p><p><i>6. In all other areas where troops are to be deployed and where malaria is endemic, the chemoprophylactic agent(s) will be dictated by the predominant species of plasmodium in the area as well as the resistance patterns to the various agents.  For example, currently Doxycycline is the recommended first line chemoprophylactic agent for the malaria season in Afghanistan.</i></p><p><i>7. Irrespective of which agent is used, all deploying personnel should be made aware of the steps to be taken to minimise mosquito bites in the first place e.g. long sleeves, unexposed legs, use of insect repellant on face and neck and other exposed areas, mosquito nets etc etc.</i></p><p><i>8. There is a requirement for personnel returning to Ireland from deployment in a malarious and/or tropical or Sub Saharan mission/area to be provided with the following medications on repatriation and to be advised on the importance and necessity of course completion:</i></p><p><i>a. Primaquine 15mgs twice daily for 14 days.</i></p><p><i>b. Mefloquine (Lariam) 250mgs weekly for 4 weeks.</i></p><p><i>c. Mebendazole 100mgs twice daily for 3 days.</i></p><p><i>The above regime should commence following repatriation so that the Primaquine and Mebendazole regime is taken concurrently with the last 2 weeks of the Lariam prophylaxis regime.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Defence Forces Regulations A.12. (Medical Treatment) provides for medical examination of all members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The Defence Forces Director Medical Branch instruction No. 40 Medical Examinations amendment No. 3, dated 6 September, 2012 paragraph 5 provides for individual screening and assessment of members of the Defence Force who present for Overseas Medical Examinations.  This paragraph provides that the individual member will be:</p><p><i>&ldquo;subjected to a full medical examination with particular emphasis being given to the physical and psychological demands of the mission and the patient&rsquo;s age and suitability for the specific environment, the proposed vaccinations and any relevant chemo prophylactic agent which may be required.&rdquo;</i></p><p>  The current policy is consistent with previous policy in relation to malaria prophylaxis.  The Defence Forces policy, in relation to the use of anti-malaria medication, including Lariam, is in line with current summary of product characteristics and product manufacturer&rsquo;s guidelines.</p><p>  Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis medication is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. </p><p>  Significant precautions are taken by Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.

These rules define contingent assets and liabilities as &quot;<i>agreements whereby one party is obliged to provide a payment or series of payments to another unit only where certain specific conditions prevail.</i>&quot;  (ESA 2010 para 5.08)  The rules further clarify that &quot;<i>As they do not give rise to unconditional obligations, contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not considered as financial assets and liabilities</i>&quot;  ESA 2010 para 7.19 (d) clarifies that contingent assets and contingent liabilities lie outside the asset/liability boundary and are therefore not recorded in the national accounts.  However  ESA 2010 acknowledges (para 5.11) that &quot;<i>Although contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recorded in the accounts, they are important for policy and analysis and information on them needs to be collected and presented as supplementary data.&quot; </i>The guidance in ESA 2010 is thus in line with other accounting standards (IPSAS 19, IAS 37) which direct that contingent assets/liabilities should not be recognised in the balance sheet but should generally be disclosed unless the likelihood of their realisation is extremely remote.</p><p>The focus on reporting of such supplementary information for the government accounts in recent years has been on the disclosure of contingent liabilities rather than contingent assets.  Information on guarantees and off-balance sheet PPPs have been collected as part of the bi-annual EDP notification for a number of years, but these data have not been published in a consistent format across Member States until recently.  Article 14 of  the European Council Directive 2011/85/EU of 8 November 2011, on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States, established the requirement for publication of &quot;<i>relevant information on contingent liabilities with potentially large impacts on public budgets, including government guarantees, non-performing loans, and liabilities stemming from the operation of public corporations, including the extent thereof.  Member States shall also publish information on the participation of general government in the capital of private and public corporations in respect of economically significant amount.</i>&quot;</p><p>In 2014 Eurostat put in place templates and a transmission facility for countries to report on contingent liabilities of government in compliance with the Directive.  Annual data on contingent liabilities have been transmitted to Eurostat and published nationally since end 2014.  These data are available on the Department of Finance website  <i>.</i></p><p>No similar framework for the reporting of contingent assets currently exists and the CSO do not currently compile data on the contingent assets of government.</p></reply>

I would draw the Deputy's attention to the importance of technology in the context of Road Policing, as set out in the Modernisation and Renewal Programme, including the expansion of ANPR, and the planned use of roadside hand-held devices.  The annual Policing Plans over the lifetime of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme will provide an excellent opportunity to set out how these longer term goals will be progressively realised.  The significant investment in Garda resources currently underway is closely associated with delivery on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme and it is, therefore, important that these resources are deployed in a targeted manner so that the impact of these resources on Roads Policing (and, of course, on other areas of policing) over time can be monitored and reported on. </p>  <p>  I know the Deputy is aware of the Government's multi-agency approach to road safety in Ireland, whereby relevant stakeholders work in partnership to promote and enforce road safety.  My Department engages regularly with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport across a number of different fora in this regard, including the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group, which oversees the implementation of the recommendations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate Report in this area; a number of which relate to information technology.</p>  <p>  In addition, I will be meeting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport later this month at the biannual Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, which oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues.</p></reply>

On foot of this the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action for last Friday to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.  The Associations have also now deferred the further three days of industrial action planned for this month.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and yesterday agreed to accept the recommendation of the Labour Court.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost.</p>  <p>  It is important now that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the position remains unchanged.  The processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned is under consideration and has not yet reached a conclusion but I understand however that the case is due to be submitted for decision in the very near future.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While most cases are now generally processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.

The aim of the Bill is to update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery.  It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling. </p>  <p>  The bill proposes to confer responsibility for all regulatory matters on the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister's functions as set out in the draft Scheme include licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it is envisaged that these functions will be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally. </p>  <p>  The proposed legislation has consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures will include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p>  <p>  As regards progressing the proposed legislation, departmental officials are currently reviewing the Scheme published in 2013, taking account of intervening developments and technologies in the gaming sector.  This review will help to update policy in this area.  I am also considering whether some sections might be prioritised as they may require more immediate action rather than is possible with the longer, more detailed Bill.    It is the intention that work on such early measures will continue in tandem with the wider review of the existing Scheme of a Bill to avoid any undue delay.</p></reply>

A formal proposal submitted by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre recognised that, given the significant budget, funding would be divided between four Departments - the Departments of Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health.  I wrote to the relevant Ministers on this matter and expressed my support for the project.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-09a.156.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900069#WRC01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware (Parliamentary Questions 20 and 69 of 29/09/2016) the fiscal rules to which Ireland is subject have direct application through a number of EU regulations as well as having domestic legal effect through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 following the passage of a constitutional referendum in May 2012.  Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  I and my Department are active in a number of fora in the EU that discuss the fiscal rules, including the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), the Economic and Finance Committee (EFC), the EFC-Alternates, the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and the Output Gap Working Group (OGWG).</p>  <p>  The issue of facilitating greater flexibility in the application of the fiscal rules has received significant focus at European level and framed discussions on the establishment of the structural and investment clauses, which were codified by the Commission in November 2015.  Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.   </p>  <p>  There are also certain more explicit flexibility provisions within the rules.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, public investment is granted favourable treatment - as a result of four-year capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  Furthermore, the fiscal rules aim to facilitate the conduct of counter-cyclical policy, notably via the cyclical conditions matrix. </p>  <p>  Moreover, former practice involved reference rates being fixed every three years in the calculation of fiscal space under the expenditure benchmark.   In the case of Ireland, this would have significantly supressed the permitted real net expenditure growth rate, since reference rates would have placed greater weight on an outdated outlook when potential growth was considerably weaker.  In advance of Ireland entering the Preventive Arm, my officials initiated discussions with the Commission, calling for an annual recalibration of the reference rates and were successful in lobbying to the Commission to this end.  This new approach significantly increases the permitted room for expenditure growth, which would not have been possible under the former practice. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in the same period, Ireland gained the endorsement of the EPC on an alternate and more plausible method of calculation of projected working age population growth to be used when estimating potential output, resulting in a 1.0 percentage point improvement in potential output growth for 2017-2020.  The impact of these changes were described in Box 10 of the Spring Economic Statement 2015.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to progress work aimed at producing sensible estimates of supply-side indicators, the importance of which has been repeatedly highlighted by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  A summary of this work has been included in Box 1 of the 2016 Stability Programme Update. </p>  <p>  Finally, the harmonised methodology for calculating the economic cycle used in the implementation of the SGP remains an area with limitations within the fiscal rules.  My Department has secured useful changes to this methodology over the years by consistently raising concerns and objections at European level.  These changes have partially compensated for the reality that the harmonised methodology is not suitable for small open economies.  My Department continues to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively on this and other relevant technical issues.</p>  <p>  The fiscal rules are designed to promote budgetary discipline and underpin sustainable economic growth.  While Ireland's economy is growing and debt is on a downward trajectory, the debt level is still comparably high and caution must be exercised due to the potential of rollover risk should interest rates increase.  We are a small and very open economy in a world that has more risks than usual.  It makes sense to reach a balanced budget in structural terms by 2018.  Reducing our debt to much lower levels will increase our capacity to withstand shocks by building our capacity to borrow.  Compliance with the fiscal rules underpins and facilitates this. </p></reply>

Member States are free to choose whatever level of capital spending they like, subject to the requirement that the expenditure can be financed.  Put another way, resources are finite - it is a question of whether we prioritise current expenditure or capital expenditure.  This is, of course, a difficult balancing act, and in the recent Budget the Government struck an appropriate balance. </p>  <p>  It is also worth pointing out the flexibility provisions within the fiscal rules for capital spending.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, public investment is granted favourable treatment through the four-year smoothing of capital formation increases.  This means that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  Bascially, this facilitates the front loading of capital formation increases.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for continued strong economic growth.  My view is that the fiscal rules should not be seen as inhibiting policymakers - they are about ensuring sustainable improvements in living standards for all our citizens.</p></reply>

The dual process of using energy inputs to generate both heat and power is the most efficient use of fuel with an energy efficiency of up to 80%, which is significantly higher than individual processes.  It makes use of the heat produced in electricity generation instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. </p><p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's White Paper on Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030 indicates that CHP can provide a method of improving efficiency of energy use leading to emission reductions, as well as committing to the development of a policy framework to encourage the growth of CHP.  Biomass CHP as a power source will make a contribution towards achieving 2020 targets in both the renewable electricity and heat sectors.  The paper takes into account European and International climate change objectives and agreements, as well as Irish social, economic and employment priorities. </p><p>In that context, my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment wrote to me asking that I consider the supports for the incentivisation of CHP Plants in Budget 2017.  Separately, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is updating the certification processes and will now base certification on the fuel used in the highly efficient production of electricity in CHP Plants.  This will provide relief retrospectively based on the actual data used in highly efficient production of electricity.</p><p>Work is ongoing to transition away from the use of fossil fuels, however, in the meantime, it is logical to ensure that when fossil fuels are used they are used as efficiently as possible.  It is for that reason I decided to provide a full relief from the carbon tax when the fuel is used in a highly efficient process.</p><p>I am informed by Revenue that the partial carbon tax relief for fuel used for environmentally friendly CHP installations was introduced in the Finance Act 2012 and the cost to date of that relief is just under &euro;760,000. </p><p>The following table contains the amounts claimed in 2014, 2015 and 2016 in respect of the relief and shows the total amount claimed since introduction.<table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Number of Claims</th><th>Amount Refunded</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>2</td><td>&euro;82,133.00</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>24</td><td>&euro;264,733.51</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>44</td><td>&euro;411,754.60</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>&euro;758,621.11</td></tr></table></p><p>The Finance Bill 2016 includes a proposal to introduce a full relief from carbon taxation for fuel used in CHP to produce high efficiency electricity.  I am advised that Revenue has made an approximate estimate of just under &euro;2m to provide full relief (&euro;1.87m) for all fuel.  This estimate is based upon information currently available which is largely composed of projected energy efficiency performance of CHP installations.  This estimate also includes data concerning CHP units that are still in the planning stage, but have been included to avoid underestimation. </p></reply>

The authorisation process is broadly consistent across the European Union and entirely consistent within the eurozone. Post 'Banking Union', the European Central Bank ('ECB') is the competent authority in Ireland for the granting of banking licences in accordance with Section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971 (as amended).  The Central Bank has published Guidelines on its website to assist those wishing to submit an application for a Banking Licence under Section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1971.</p><p>The principal stages in the authorisation process are as follows: </p><p>- Exploratory Phase - During this phase the potential applicant will submit a proposal to the Central Bank for review.  The Central Bank will undertake a detailed review of the proposal and issue comments advising the applicant of any further information or clarifications required in relation to any aspect of the proposal.  The purpose of the review is to determine whether the proposal will meet the required standard for authorisation.  The Central Bank will, having conducted an initial assessment, notify the ECB of receipt of the proposal and provide all required information to enable it to commence its assessment of the proposal; </p><p>- Formal Application - Should the proposal meet the required standard, the applicant will then submit an application for authorisation.  Both the Central Bank and the ECB will complete their assessment of the application which may involve further clarification being sought from the applicant.  At the end of this stage the Central Bank will determine whether to recommend to the ECB that authorisation be granted; </p><p>- ECB Decision - Decision by the ECB on whether to grant a banking licence - A banking licence will only be granted where the ECB and the Central Bank are satisfied that the applicant complies with the authorisation requirements.  The robustness of the discharging of our gatekeeping role is critical to the protection of consumers and maintenance of financial stability.</p><p>In relation to applications for authorisation under Section 9A of the Central Bank Act, 1971, referred to as 'Third Country Branches' (i.e. where the applicant is a credit institution whose head office is located in a state or territory other than an EEA state and which holds an authorisation to carry on banking business in that state or territory from the authority that exercises in that state or territory functions corresponding to those of ), the Central Bank is the competent authority for granting such authorisations.</p><p>The principal stages are the same as for section 9 authorisations, set out above, with the exception that there is no ECB involvement in the assessment and the decision on authorisation is made solely by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has published a Policy Statement on the authorisation of Third Country Branches.</p><p>The total time for licensing will depend upon: </p><p>- the quality of the proposal submitted by the applicant;</p><p>- the nature, scale and complexity of the proposed business model;</p><p>- the time taken by the applicant to respond to comments raised on each draft of the proposal and application; </p><p>- the quality of the responses received addressing all issues raised; </p><p>- any changes made by the applicant to its proposal during the authorisation process; and </p><p>- the time taken by any relevant third parties to respond to queries in relation to the application. </p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that once a full, completed application is received and accepted, the assessment process is commenced without delay but in practice, the authorisation process takes many months of engagement, discussion and back and forth on key issues before the application is completed.  So measuring on this basis we can expect a time horizon of probably at least a year.</p><p>When it comes to applications for licences in Ireland, the Central Bank assures me that it stands ready to meet the challenges that may arise.  The Central Bank will do so on the basis of an active, open stance, ready to engage, but in line with their duty to protect consumers, and in keeping with EU rules, international standards, and our published processes.</p></reply>

It takes into account risks from an economic, environmental, geo-political, social and technological perspective to take a holistic view of all potential areas of risk.  The NRA finds that the main risks in Ireland in 2016 relate to Brexit/uncertainty over the UK's relationship with the EU, weakening global economic growth, infrastructural deficits, international terrorism and expenditure pressures. </p><p>The Department of Finance inputs into this national exercise in respect of economic risks. </p><p>Section 2 of the NRA deals with Economic Risks and section 2.3 examines the issues around the importance of multinational corporations to the Irish economy and the risk of unfavourable international tax changes.</p><p>The document recognises that Ireland's economy and employment are heavily dependent on a relatively small number of multinational corporations concentrated in a small number of enterprise sectors.</p><p>The identified risks in relation to tax issues and multinational corporations simply reflect reality.  The Taoiseach has stated that: &quot;the Draft National Risk Assessment 2016 sets out risks for public consultation.  They are complex and demand a considered policy response.  By being open about these risks, we hope we can have a mature debate about these challenges and their implications for Ireland&quot;.</p><p>The Corporation Tax receipt profile is kept under ongoing review by the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, and it is one of the issues covered by the National Risk Assessment is the receipt profile of various tax heads.</p><p>The NRA was recently published by the Department of An Taoiseach and is available at the following link - <i>.</i></p></reply>

Budget 2017, published last month, also projected annual growth in income tax for 2016 of 4.5%, with receipts of &euro;19,185 million expected.  This is an additional &euro;190 million above the Budget 2016 estimate for this tax head.</p>  <p>  Looking at the performance in the year-to-date, income tax receipts to end October 2016 are currently up 4.2% or &euro;577 million year-on-year, but 0.6% or &euro;94 million below profile.  The performance of DIRT in 2015 was disappointing and this has continued in 2016 following lower-than-expected interest rates with receipts from this sub-component now c. &euro;130 million below profile.  Removing the impact of DIRT receipts from the income tax performance in the year-to-date would show overall receipts marginally ahead of profile, with almost one quarter of the annual income tax receipts profiled for the last two months of the year.</p>  <p>  This indicates that the main elements of income tax continue to show robust year-on-year growth rather than a "relatively low increase" that the Deputy refers to.</p>  <p>  As regards wage levels of low and middle income workers, I would remind the Deputy of the importance of safeguarding our competitiveness, particularly in light of the uncertainty presented by Brexit.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of the significant depreciation of sterling over the past year or so, and the impact that this is having on our competitiveness.  In order to protect jobs and prevent an increase in unemployment, it is paramount that wages move in line with productivity.  Finally, I would highlight that inflation has been virtually non-existent this year, which is helping to protect real wages.  </p></reply>

The only requirements are that they already hold a relevant level 8 or equivalent qualification and are able to demonstrate the capacity and underlying aptitude to undergo an intensive programme of study and work experience to acquire honours degree level ICT programming skills.  ICT Conversion Courses are available on a one year full time basis, or a two-year part time basis. </p><p>Participants on part-time Springboard courses who are in receipt of one of the eligible Department of Social Protection income support payments may be able to retain such payments under the Part Time Education Option (PTEO) payment.  There is no requirement for participants to be in receipt of one of these payments for a particular period of time prior to the commencement of the part-time Springboard course, however, participation on a Springboard course does not confer any entitlement to receive an income support payment from the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>A person undertaking a full-time ICT Skills Conversion Course who is receipt of Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance for at least nine of the previous twelve months prior to commencing the course may qualify to retain their income support while participating in a full-time ICT skills conversion course.  Eligible participants will transfer to a bespoke version of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA).  </p><p>Applicants in receipt of the Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit, Farm Assist, or those who are receiving benefits as Qualified Adults of Working Age, may participate on a two-year part-time ICT skills conversion course however they are not eligible for BTEA as they are not undertaking a full-time course of study.  They will also not be able to retain their payment under the Part Time Education Option (PTEO) payment.  Those in receipt of other payments such as the One Parent Family Allowance or the Disability Allowance, may be eligible to participate on the part-time programmes and retain their payment. </p><p>The BTEA and the PTEO are administered by the Department of Social Protection. Queries in relation to eligibility for the PTEO and the BTEA are dealt with by that Department.</p><p>Further details on Springboard+ courses and eligibility are available at <i>www.springboardcourses.ie</i>.</p><p>Courses under Springboard+ are not eligible for receipt of Student Grants as they do not meet the criteria for an approved course.  Under the Student Grant Scheme, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration, pursued in an approved institution.  Section 8 (1) (b) of the Student Support Act 2011, requires a student to attend a full-time course, in order to be considered for a grant under the Student Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

I understand that the first phase of this project to deliver 14 new houses is scheduled to commence on site shortly, while the second phase to deliver a minimum of 55 houses is at design stage.  As with all social housing proposals, there is an onus on the local authority and on my Department to ensure best value for money and a reasonable density within the development to meet respond to social housing need. Accordingly, contacts between my Department and Galway City Council have included the consideration of options in relation to the density and design for this development, but such considerations should not delay advancement of the project.  I have assured all local authorities that funding is available to support them in the early advancement of new social housing projects.  With funding approval already in place, I am particularly keen to see the phases of the project at Ballymoneen Road advanced as quickly as possible, with the precise dates for completion being a matter for Galway City Council.</p><p>More broadly on social housing across Galway City Council and Galway County Council, both local authorities were notified of social housing targets and provisional funding allocations in April 2015; these are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>The two Galway authorities have a combined target of 1,126 social housing units for the period out to 2017, supported by an allocation of &euro;58.5 million, to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes.</p><p>Following the notification of these targets, approvals for a substantial number of new social housing projects were announced in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016.  These three announcements included over 270 units of accommodation in respect of Galway, supported by investment of some &euro; 44.3 million, details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>In addition, a project to deliver 73 new social housing units at Ballyburke in Galway is amongst over 450 new units that are part of bundle 2 of the social housing Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme.  I announced the eight sites in bundle 2 in co-operation with the local authorities in each area in July 2016 and the projects have a capital value of approximately &euro;100 million, as part of a programme of investment totalling &euro;300 million in social housing through the PPP model that will, overall, deliver 1,500 social housing units.  All of these projects are now undergoing planning and development work by the local authorities and, as with all social housing projects.  I am keen to see them advanced as soon as possible.</p><p>With the projects already in the pipeline for both Galway Councils, and given the measures set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, l anticipate a ramping up in terms of social housing construction activity over the next year.  While social housing construction projects are being advanced, acquisitions of new and second-hand houses and apartments remain an effective means of meeting immediate social housing need.  This year, the Galway Councils are looking to purchase around 40 housing units for social housing purposes, while they have also continued to receive substantial support from my Department to remediate vacant social homes and make them available to those on the waiting list.</p><p>Support is also provided by my Department to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) for the delivery of new social housing.  This funding approach is being used to support the acquisition of 165 units by four AHBs in Galway City and County.  Delivery is contingent on AHBs securing the balance of funding required from either private finance or other borrowings.  If successful, it is anticipated that 69 of these units will be delivered by the end of 2016, a further 92 in 2017 and the final 4 in early 2018. Locations include Roscam, Ballinasloe, Ballymoneen Rd, Doughiska, Spiddal and Tuam.</p></reply>

Class K PRSI only applies to their non-local authority income.</p>  <p>  Civil and public sector workers, including local government employees, recruited before April 1995 pay PRSI on their salary at modified or lower rates of contribution and are classified for PRSI purposes under PRSI Classes B, C or D.  These &ldquo;modified rate&rdquo; contributors have access to a limited range of social insurance benefits, including widow/widowers&rsquo; contributory payments and guardian&rsquo;s payment contributory.</p>  <p>  Civil and public sector employees engaged after 1995 pay PRSI on their salary under PRSI Class A.  It is charged at the rate of 4% for employees, with employer PRSI rates of 8.5% or 10.75%, depending on earnings.  Class A PRSI contributions entitle the employee to access the full range of long term and short term social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  In 2013, modified rate contributors who also have earned self-employed income or unearned income became liable, for the first time, to pay PRSI on that earned income.  This income is liable at the class K rate of 4%.  Entitlement to social insurance benefits does not accrue from the payment of this charge.  </p>  <p>  Since 2014, all employees (in the public and private sector) and occupational pensioners under 66 years, with unearned income only, are liable to pay Class K PRSI on that unearned income where it exceeds &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  Class K PRSI is charged at 4% and does not give access to social insurance entitlements based on the payment of the charge.  Prior to 2014 these employees were exempt from PRSI on such unearned income, which includes rental and investment income, dividends and interest on deposits.  This provision applies to all employees, regardless of the PRSI class they pay on their employment income.  </p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment.  If an employee has income from self-employment e.g. taxi driver, farmer etc. he or she also pays PRSI as a self-employed contributor on the profits from the taxi driving plus any other unearned income he or she might have e.g. rental income.  The measure to charge class K PRSI on employees who have unearned income only was introduced to ensure equity by ensuring that PRSI is chargeable, regardless of the source of the employee&rsquo;s additional income.  </p>  <p>  Employees paying class K PRSI on unearned income can generate entitlement to social insurance benefits based on PRSI they pay on their employment income.  Class A employees with unearned income already have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, because of their PRSI class A status.  Modified rate employees have access to a limited range of social insurance benefits but have entitlement to generous Exchequer-funded occupational pensions.</p></reply>

These are Lesser Knotweed (<i>Persicaria campanulata</i>), Giant Rhubarb (<i>Gunnera tinctoria</i>) and Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>).  Each of these poses its own particular challenge and requires a specific plan of action to control, manage and, where possible and practicable, eradicate.</p><p>Lesser Knotweed is present in a small area of Connemara National Park and is not considered a major threat.  A plan has been developed, in conjunction with Letterfrack Tidy Towns Committee, to eradicate this species within the village and the National Park.  Due to the small area involved, costs will be minimal and total eradication is expected. </p><p>A small number of Giant Rhubarb plants have been identified within the confines of the National Park. Due to identification of this species in the adjacent Letterfrack village area, it has been included in the plan, formulated with Letterfrack Tidy Towns, to eradicate invasive species from the area.  As with Lesser Knotweed, it is expected that the costs involved will be low, being limited mainly to the cost of the herbicides used.</p><p>Rhododendron occurs in important habitats in Connemara National Park such as oak woodlands, bogs and heath, and is considered a problematic invasive species.  My Department carries out an annual targeted programme of works to manage the spread of Rhododendron in the Park.  The extent of the problem varies from area to area within the Park and, having regard to the very dynamic nature of this invasive species, the targeted management programme is routinely monitored and adjusted with a view to ensuring optimum efficacy.  </p><p>If left unchecked, this invasive species can grow in dense thickets and replace native shrub, exclude native vegetation, and constrain native woodland regeneration.  The management programme has made significant inroads into the problem and large areas of previously infested areas are now clear of the plant. Since 2012, over &euro;13,000 has been spent by my Department on Rhododendron clearance in Connemara National Park. </p><p>Ultimately the plan is to clear all Rhododendron ponticum from our National Parks and, as part of that plan, the annual Rhododendron management programme is intended to create conditions in the Park that are conducive to the protection and re-establishment of native species and, particularly, our native woodlands.  My Department is committed to continuing this important and challenging work into the future.</p><p>In this regard I would like to recognise the important contribution of volunteer groups to this work, and also to acknowledge the excellent work of my Department&rsquo;s staff in Connemara National Park who, along with their colleagues in National Parks around the country, have been instrumental in developing new methods to increase the effectiveness of our efforts to control this plant and other invasive species.</p><p>General information on invasive species and what the public can do to help is available on the invasive species section of the National Biodiversity Data Centre website at .</p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.

The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the Review.

The cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors such as the number of persons in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations.  Each of these are contributors to the cost of care, the cost of claims and therefore the cost of premia payable.</p>  <p>  While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people choose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital.  Prior to the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, private in-patients in public hospitals were, in the case of an emergency admission where a private bed was not available, accommodated in a public bed for which they were charged &euro;75 per day (to a maximum of &euro;750 for 10 nights per annum) although they continued to pay the fees of their hospital consultant.  The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his 2010 Annual Report that almost 45% of in-patients being treated privately by consultants were not paying the designated charge to the public hospitals in which they were being treated, because they did not occupy a designated private bed.  This represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system, to taxpayers and was an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.</p>  <p>  On the basis that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital the previous Government introduced legislation in 2013 to amend Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 to provide for the charging of private in-patients whenever they have opted to be treated as a private patient by their hospital consultant.  The charging regime as introduced was intended to decrease but not eliminate any gap in providing services to private in-patients and that target is being reached.  There are no plans to reverse this policy.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that under the 2013 Act, all private patients are charged in a similar manner, and this enabled the legislation to provide for an average reduction of 9% in the daily charges for private patients in public hospitals.  The private in-patient charge goes not only towards meeting accommodation costs but also towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital's services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, administration and support staff, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), medical and surgical supplies, operating theatres, laboratory services (such as blood tests etc) and capital costs.</p></reply>

The committee will present its final report to the D&aacute;il by 23 January 2017. </p>  <p>  In relation to private health insurance, in Ireland we have a system of community rated private health insurance which is supported by a Risk Equalisation Scheme.  Under the Risk Equalisation Scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation and hospital utilisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members.  The credits are funded by stamp duty levies payable by insurers in respect of each life covered.  The Risk Equalisation Scheme ensures that some of the higher cost of insuring older and less healthy members is shared across the market.  The Health Insurance Authority closely monitors claims paid by insurers and demographic changes in the private health insurance market.  The Authority takes these into account each year when recommending the level of credits and associated stamp duties to apply under the Risk Equalisation Scheme. </p>  <p>  The overall cost of private health insurance is influenced by a number of factors including the number of people in the market, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and medical innovations which can have an impact on the cost of care and the cost of claims.  An increase in the number of younger and healthy people taking out health insurance helps to control premium inflation, thereby keeping health insurance more affordable for older and less healthy people.  Lifetime Community Rating was introduced in 2015 and has encouraged people to take out health insurance at a younger age.  In a community rated market this helps to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons.  The introduction of young adult rates in 2015 has also helped to increase the number of young insured people in the market. </p></reply>

The Regulations provide for two different classes of income-based charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided:</p>  <p>  - Class 1 relates to charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24-hour nursing care is provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or more, and</p>  <p>  - Class 2 charges apply where 24-hour nursing care is not provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or more.</p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the charging provisions under the 2005 Act and Regulations:</p>  <p>  - Firstly, the Act caps the amount which may be charged &ndash; at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.  At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;177.60 per week.</p>  <p>  - Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.</p>  <p>  - Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship.</p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for in-patient services.  These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments.  This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.</p>  <p>  Legislation to commence Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions (long stay contributions) will come into operation on 1 January 2017.  They will replace the existing system of long stay charges. </p>  <p>  The key features of the existing long-stay charges system will be retained including the above mentioned 30 day rule and comprehensive waiver provisions to ensure that contribution requirements are in line with what people can afford.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-09a.442.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016110900073#WRG01300"><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to the establishment of an Oireachtas All-Party committee to develop a long term vision for healthcare and direction of health policy over a 10 year period, with cross party support.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established in June this year and has been specifically tasked with examining and costing different funding models for the health service and to make recommendations on a funding approach that is best suited to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  The development of a new funding model is key to the long-term sustainability of our health service and the development of a universal single tier service.</p>  <p>  However, making changes to funding levels and financing methods takes time and requires careful management, not least to avoid disruption to vital existing services. It is for these reasons that the all-party Committee has been established and tasked with considering this important issue in the context of an overall long-term vision and plan of how the health service can be developed.</p>  <p>  I have already committed to not making any major structural reforms in this area while the Committee does its work, as we have to be serious about building consensus on how to fund a shared vision of universal healthcare.  However, I am continuing delivery of aspects of the ongoing health reform programme which must be completed so that the foundations are in place to change the funding model.  In this regard, it is worth noting that one of the key building blocks for universal healthcare that is currently being advanced by the HSE is the introduction of a more efficient payment system for hospitals known as activity-based funding.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government confirmed the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the implementation of activity based funding, which went live in 2016.  This is a model whereby hospitals and other healthcare providers are funded based on the quality and quantity of the services they deliver for patients as opposed to historical budgets. Linking budgets with activity will drive efficiency and increase transparency in the provision of high quality services for patients.</p></reply>

Movements are recorded at the level of Member State only on TRACES.  Figures from TRACES show that in October of this year, 44,072 sheep of all ages were imported from the United Kingdom, compared to 39,424 in October 2015.  The vast majority of these animals came from Northern Ireland, though no further geographic breakdown is available at this time.  There are no category breakdowns available to specify for lambs, however the animals are categorised as breeding, fattening and or those for direct slaughter.  </p>  <p>  For October 2016 these figures are 129 for breeding, 4,963 for fattening and 38,980 for direct slaughter.  In October 2015 the corresponding figures were 193 for breeding, 766 for fattening and 38,465 for slaughter. </p>  <p>  This government is acutely aware of the importance of the sheep sector in Ireland and the vital contribution it makes to both the agri-food industry and rural life in Ireland.  In recognition of this, the Programme for Government commits to the introduction of a scheme for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme with a budget of some &euro;25 million to be provided in Budget 2017.  This scheme, in addition to the existing supports available to sheep farmers under the BPS, GLAS, ANC and TAMS, will make a vital contribution to ensuring the continuing viability and sustainability of the sheep sector in Ireland.</p></reply>

To date almost &euro;184 million has been paid to 85,000 applicants.  It is expected that some 97,000 applicants will qualify for payment under the scheme.</p>  <p>   A number of applications are not yet clear for payment under the scheme; the applicants are aware of the scheme requirements and what is required to fulfil them.  In particular, many farmers have yet to satisfy the annual average stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare for the calendar year.  However, farmers have until 31 Dec 2016 to do so.  Such cases will clear for payment once  compliance with this requirement has been confirmed.</p>  <p>  The total number of applicants with entitlements allocated under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) is currently just over 128,000.  Only valid applications under the BPS that fully comply with the requirements of the EU legislation are paid. Each year a number of cases are found to be &ldquo;in error&rdquo; - errors include over-claims, dual claims and incomplete application forms.  In order to resolve these issues, the Department enters into correspondence with farmers.  The aim is to issue such query letters as early as possible in the process although this is not always possible as error cases will continue to arise as cases are processed.  </p>  <p>  This year the Department introduced the concept of preliminary checks for BPS online applicants.  This involved the Department notifying online BPS applicants of non-compliance in the areas of overclaims, dualclaims, and overlaps in the weeks following the closing date for BPS (16 May).  Applicants were then given an opportunity to rectify any identified non-compliance before 20 June and there was no penalty or reduction where such non-compliance was fully rectified.</p>  <p>  In total, some 12,000 BPS error notifications have issued to applicants.  In response to requests from stakeholder groups, text messages also issue in these cases to inform the farmer that an error has arisen.</p>  <p>  Payments under the BPS commenced on 17th October, which is the earliest possible date allowable under regulation, and to date in excess of &euro;772m has issued to over 117,000 applicants.  Regular payment runs are continuing in order to clear to payment all applicants whose applications are fully processed and who have no outstanding errors.</p></reply>

At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.</p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The Taskforce has met several times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p><p>To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p><p>Approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to over 90% of the population.  It is estimated that up to 42% of premises in Co. Monaghan will have access to commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the  remaining 58% consisting of just over 19,000 premises in Co. Monaghan will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area and provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including Co Monaghan.</p><p>The maps shows that Latton in the townland of Lisdrumcleve falls within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie.</i></p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30Megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the Taskforce to report by end 2016. </p><p>I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE  which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total  spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.</p><p>These initiatives should assist in significantly improving the quality of broadband and mobile phone services across Ireland, putting Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

The EU aims to deliver  a 20% reduction in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, and 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020.</p><p>In relation to GHG emissions, for each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has an emissions reduction target under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) No. 406/2009/EC.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. </p><p>In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the <i>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, 2015</i>,<i></i>which was enacted in December 2015.  The <i>National Policy Position </i>provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Act. </p><p>In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway, identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce GHG emissions, and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the efforts outlined above to address the challenge to comply with the 2020 targets, in the event that a gap to target still exists in 2020, retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 can be offset against the deficit.  In the event that this would not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase  notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.  Should the need to purchase carbon units arise, funding options will be considered in due course and will have regard to a number of matters, including the need to comply with the fiscal rules.</p><p>In relation to renewable energy, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources.  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and good progress is being made<font color="#1F497D">. </font>Nevertheless, meeting our 2020 targets remains very challenging. </p><p>While the cost of any shortfall in Ireland's target of 16% has yet to be established, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.</p><p>In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  I expect the Taskforce to report by the end of this year. </p><p>In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RT&Eacute; which will allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.</p><p>Through the implementation of the Programme for Government we are committed to increasing the availability of high speed broadband and mobile services, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.</p><p>The extent of the long term challenge arising from climate change is well understood by Government.  Existing policy is set out in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (2014) which established a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of mitigation and adaptation plans to enable the State to pursue the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050 (known as the &lsquo;<i>national transition objective&rsquo;</i>).  Subsequently, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 established the national transition objective on a statutory basis and in order to facilitate the transition, provided, inter alia, for the development and submission to Government for approval of national mitigation plans and national adaptation frameworks.</p><p>Development work on the first mitigation plan and adaptation framework is progressing.  Under the 2015 Act, a draft National Mitigation Plan will be made available for public consultation by the end of the year, followed by submission of a final plan to Government for approval by June 2017.  The primary objective of the mitigation plan will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.</p><p>Similarly in relation to adaptation, the 2015 Act provides for the making and submission to the Government of iterative national adaptation frameworks which will specify the national strategy for the application of adaptation measures in different sectors and by local authorities in order to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change and to exploit any beneficial opportunities that may arise.  Work is progressing in relation to the first adaptation framework, which must be submitted to Government no later than 10 December 2017.</p><p>Policy in relation to tackling both the mitigation and adaptation aspects of climate change in Ireland has been in development for a number of years, having regard to EU and international obligations, national policy and the recent legislative provisions referred to earlier.  Taken together, these and other measures, including the mainstreaming of climate change considerations into policies and operations across different sectors and the National Dialogue on Climate Change, form part of a long-term strategy to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors and carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land sector.  They will also assist our towns and cities to adapt to the future impacts that climate change will bring and ultimately build a level of climate resilience that society will require in the future.</p></reply>

The scheme was open to projects that are funded by the Department under the Special Projects for Youth scheme, Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, Local Drugs Task Force Projects scheme and Youth Information Centres scheme.  The scheme was also open to national youth organisations in receipt of funding under the Youth Services Grants Scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was split into two categories, Type One and Type Two.  Type One provided for smaller capital projects including the up-grade or replacement of equipment or the purchase of essential equipment to support the running of the project/organisation in the provision of quality services for young people.  Type Two provided for health and safety improvements to premises and/or upgrade or refurbishment of premises, including improvements to enable access for young people with disabilities, including those with physical or sensory disabilities.  Applicants were limited to one application under Type One and one application under Type Two and the maximum grant payable was &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland successfully applied for funding under this scheme and was awarded &euro;49,630 under Type Two to fund the improvement of disability access and security at Scouting Ireland, National Water Activity Centre in Killaloe, Co. Clare.  A second Type Two application was received in respect of Scouting Ireland's Larch Hill premises.  The application was deemed ineligible by the Youth Capital Scheme 2016/2017 Appraisal Committee as organisations were limited to one Type Two application only.  My Department has received no application for funding amounting to &euro;1.2m from Scouting Ireland. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of a new capital funding scheme for 2017 is underway.  My Department is engaging with each Education and Training Board Youth Officer to identify the capital needs of the youth sector.  I hope to announce details of this new capital scheme in the coming months.  I do not envisage that my Department will be providing grants of the magnitude sought by Scouting Ireland. </p>  <p>  Scouting Ireland receives annual funding under my Department's Youth Service Grant Scheme which supports national youth organisations.  In 2016, some &euro;835,000 has been allocated to the organisation.  In addition, &euro;200,000 is provided to them under the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p></reply>

The White Paper also outlined that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the PDF in crisis situations.  In non-crisis situations, the main focus is on training to prepare for this role.</p><p>A key recommendation of the Value for Money Review of the RDF, published in November 2012, was to ensure that all effective members of the Reserve were afforded the opportunity to undertake voluntary annual training.  In 2016, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.150m. of which &euro;2.068m is allocated to paid training.  This allocation provides for 30,000 Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve.  This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the Reserve and the voluntary nature of Reserve training.</p><p>In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours and at weekends.  Reserve training is also organised during academic and traditional holiday periods, in order to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel.</p><p><font color="#001401">In the Army Reserve, recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training.  A major part of Recruit training is training in the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle.  After recruit training is complete, soldiers are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun.  Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field.  For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps trainin weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</font></p><p><font color="#001401">In the Naval Service Reserve, the two main courses undertaken as a recruit are Sea Survival and Damage Control &amp;amp; Fire Fighting.  NSR personnel also undergo training in the operation of various crafts operated by the Naval Service, such as Motor Training Launches and Rigid Inflatable Boats.  As in the Army Reserve, NSR personnel are trained in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle.  NSR personnel also receive full training in VHF Radios, including voice procedure at sea and operation of the VHF systems.  Courses are also run for NSR personnel on the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.</font></p><p>I am satisfied that the extensive and professional training provided to the RDF along with other initiatives outlined in the White Paper will be a key motivating factor in encouraging more people to join the RDF as well as making it more attractive for current members to stay.</p></reply>

This comprises 7,247 Army, 718 Air Corps and 1,079 Naval Service.  Of this figure, 551 personnel (6.1%) are women.  The following tables contain the above mentioned strengths broken down into Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by gender and rank groupings.</p><p>The establishment ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force is 9,500.  Recruitment campaigns are under way in order to reach this establishment.  Current and previous recruitment campaigns have sought to target potential female candidates.</p><p>As has been outlined in previous replies to Parliamentary Questions, the Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including: </p><p>-  The introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants, </p><p>-  Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment, </p><p>-  A balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>-  All promotions and career courses are open to both sexes on merit,</p><p>-  A Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. </p><p>The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are communicated to all ranks on an ongoing basis.  The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i></i>However, a key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males. </p><p><b></b>I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces.  To this end, in all recruitment campaigns for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts are made to increase the number of female applicants.  These efforts include visits to schools, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and the use of social media.  I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers.  I am hopeful that through continued engagement and communication, this perception will change over time.<table><tr><th colspan="4">ARMY (PDF) </th></tr><tr><td>Rank </td><td>Male </td><td>Female </td><td>Total </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Gen </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Maj Gen </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Brig Gen </td><td>6 </td><td>0 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Col </td><td>32 </td><td>1 </td><td>33 </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Col </td><td>104 </td><td>2 </td><td>106 </td></tr><tr><td>Comdt </td><td>226 </td><td>31 </td><td>257 </td></tr><tr><td>Captain </td><td>218 </td><td>42 </td><td>260 </td></tr><tr><td>LT </td><td>133 </td><td>20 </td><td>153 </td></tr><tr><td>SM </td><td>29 </td><td>0 </td><td>29 </td></tr><tr><td>BQMS </td><td>32 </td><td>0 </td><td>32 </td></tr><tr><td>CS </td><td>101 </td><td>1 </td><td>102 </td></tr><tr><td>CQMS </td><td>159 </td><td>2 </td><td>161 </td></tr><tr><td>Sgt </td><td>823 </td><td>57 </td><td>880 </td></tr><tr><td>Cpl </td><td>1170 </td><td>114 </td><td>1284 </td></tr><tr><td>Pte </td><td>3661 </td><td>175 </td><td>3836 </td></tr><tr><td>Cadets </td><td>96 </td><td>9 </td><td>105 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>6793 </td><td>454 </td><td>7247 </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">AIR CORPS (PDF)</th></tr><tr><td>Rank </td><td>Male </td><td>Female </td><td>Total </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Maj Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Brig Gen </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Col </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Col </td><td>12 </td><td>0 </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>Comdt </td><td>31 </td><td>2 </td><td>33 </td></tr><tr><td>Captain </td><td>45 </td><td>5 </td><td>50 </td></tr><tr><td>LT </td><td>22 </td><td>0 </td><td>22 </td></tr><tr><td>SM </td><td>7 </td><td>1 </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>BQMS </td><td>3 </td><td>0 </td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>CS </td><td>55 </td><td>0 </td><td>55 </td></tr><tr><td>CQMS </td><td>12 </td><td>1 </td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td>Sgt </td><td>110 </td><td>5 </td><td>115 </td></tr><tr><td>Cpl </td><td>138 </td><td>11 </td><td>149 </td></tr><tr><td>Pte </td><td>218 </td><td>10 </td><td>228 </td></tr><tr><td>Cadets </td><td>25 </td><td>1 </td><td>26 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>682 </td><td>36 </td><td>718 </td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="4">NAVAL SERVICE (PDF)</th></tr><tr><td>Rank </td><td>Male </td><td>Female </td><td>Total </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Maj Gen </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td></tr><tr><td>Brig Gen </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td>Col </td><td>2 </td><td>0 </td><td>2 </td></tr><tr><td>Lt Col </td><td>13 </td><td>0 </td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td>Comdt </td><td>42 </td><td>9 </td><td>51 </td></tr><tr><td>Captain </td><td>36 </td><td>13 </td><td>49 </td></tr><tr><td>LT </td><td>32 </td><td>2 </td><td>34 </td></tr><tr><td>SM </td><td>6 </td><td>0 </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>BQMS </td><td>7 </td><td>0 </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>CS </td><td>74 </td><td>0 </td><td>74 </td></tr><tr><td>CQMS </td><td>15 </td><td>0 </td><td>15 </td></tr><tr><td>Sgt </td><td>170 </td><td>7 </td><td>177 </td></tr><tr><td>Cpl </td><td>123 </td><td>8 </td><td>131 </td></tr><tr><td>Pte </td><td>472 </td><td>18 </td><td>490 </td></tr><tr><td>Cadets </td><td>25 </td><td>4 </td><td>29 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>1018 </td><td>61 </td><td>1079 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The preparatory work for the tender competition has begun within the Defence organisation, and it is expected that the competition will be initiated by the end of this year.  The two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.

The future equipment priorities for the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  The current Naval Service ship replacement programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels in the past three years.  In June 2016, agreement was reached with Babcock International for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built in their facility in Appledore, Devon.  This ship will be the same class as the three newest vessels, L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett which was commissioned in 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce which was commissioned in 2015, and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats which was recently commissioned in October 2016.  Delivery of the fourth ship is expected within two years.  This ties in with the project planning process in place under the White Paper on Defence which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the current flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, by a multi-role vessel (MRV). L&Eacute; Eithne was built in 1984.  In addition, the two existing Coastal Patrol Vessels, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla are due for replacement in the coming years (also built in 1984).  It is outlined in the White Paper that these ships will be replaced with vessels with countermine and counter IED capabilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, the White Paper recognises the requirement to maintain and upgrade vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology, including communications equipment.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action outlined in the White Paper, will ensure that the Naval Service are fully equipped to meet the roles placed on them.</p></reply>
