    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100078#WRA00700"><p>I am informed by the Courts Service that the primary objective in the current economic climate is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and, in this context, over the past few years the Service has radically altered the way in which they manage the resources available to them.  Measures introduced to date include the creation of multi-jurisdictional court offices (14 such offices have been combined to date); centralisation of processes; review of resource allocation including redeployment to front line services; rationalisation of court venues and offices; standardisation of court procedures; and increased use of technology, including online payments and video link, to support court services.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that last year, following consultation with the Chief Justice, I established a cross agency Working Group to identify and implement efficiency measures with a specific focus on the high volume Circuit and District Courts.  The Group, which includes representatives of the judiciary, has recently reported to me on initiatives introduced to date.  These include a pre-trial procedure which is operating in the Dublin and the Midland Circuits on a pilot basis from 1 December 2012;  increased use of video links between courts and prisons; and the provision of same-day probation reports.  The amount of time Garda&iacute; spend waiting in court is also being actively managed and reduced.  An Expert Group on Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights has also been examining procedural measures with potential to speed up court proceedings and I expect that Group to report to me in the near future.</p><p>  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times.  It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin.  This has increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011.  The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need.</p><p>  Waiting times in the High Court have generally reduced considerably.  While the waiting time for asylum and pre-leave applications is high, the allocation of more judges and, particularly, more research support for judges has helped to reduce the waiting time for post-leave applications to four months, its lowest level in over two years.  Despite significant pressure, the waiting times in all other High Court lists have either remained the same or reduced.  The President of the High Court has introduced initiatives such as reorganising sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses to reduce waiting times.  In addition, the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has increased judicial availability for trial work. </p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times of up to 40 months at present.  Although considerable efforts are being made to manage this, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court can only be fully resolved through the establishment of a Court of Civil Appeal.  The Government is committed to the holding of a Constitutional referendum on Article 34 which is necessary to achieve this and work has commenced in my Department in this regard.</p><p>  Finally, in the context of new work for the courts as a result of the Personal Insolvency Bill, I am introducing amendments to allow for a small new cadre of specialist judges to facilitate the speedy consideration of insolvency applications by the Circuit Court.  Rather than incurring additional costs to the Exchequer, the Government has decided that eligibility for these new judgeships will be initially confined to serving County Registrars with the necessary legal qualifications and practice experience.  This will have the effect of ensuring that the creation of this new cadre will be largely cost neutral as, if a serving County Registrar is appointed as a Specialist Judge, he or she will not be replaced thus creating the necessary extra judicial resources and maximising the contribution of these existing office holders at very little additional cost. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100078#WRA00900"><p>The functions and powers of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs) are set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which provides for a Committee in each local authority area.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The current guidelines were issued in September, 2008.</p><p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Garda&iacute;.  In the spirit of that commitment I initiated a review of the operation of the Joint Policing Committees.  My Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced work on the review during 2011 and canvassed opinions from existing JPC members, which helped to inform the preparation of a discussion document.  I published this discussion document on 29 November this year to open the matter for wider consultation.  e present consultation process is open until the end of January 2013 and I am seeking views from the Garda authorities, local authorities, Oireachtas members, community organisations as well of course from the general public. I have made a specific request that each JPC would consider the document at one of its meetings and notify my Department of the outcome of its discussions.</p><p>  I look forward to the outcome of this consultation process and in that context I certainly welcome the Deputy's views on the role and functioning of the JPCs.  It is important to bear in mind, however, in considering any changes to the remit of the JPCs, that they are intended as a forum for engagement to promote more effective action by the various stakeholders and not an additional administrative structure.  Their essential role is to provide appropriate advice to the Garda&iacute; and local authorities and to support collaborative engagement among stakeholders in relation to local policing issues.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the review process will need to take into account the broader developments with respect to local government reform which are underway and the implications of this reform for the operation of JPCs.</p></reply>

The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and work is ongoing to properly align the provisions of the Bill with the principles contained in the UN Convention on supporting people with impaired capacity in making decisions and exercising their basic rights. I envisage that the title of the Bill, The Assisted Decision - Making (Capacity) Bill,  will reflect this approach.</p><p>  The Bill proposes replacement of the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework to support persons with impaired decision-making ability. The Wards of Court system is regarded as unsuited to modern conditions and incapable of coping with projected demographic growth and increased need for the management of the affairs of persons who lack capacity. The terminology and concepts used in the existing legislation of 1871 are inappropriate to the modern understanding of mental illness and legal capacity.</p><p>  The main proposals under development in the Bill are to provide a legal framework to support persons with impaired decision-making capacity to better manage their personal welfare, property and financial affairs; change existing law on capacity from the current all or nothing status approach to a functional one, whereby decision-making capacity is assessed on an issue- and time-specific basis; provide that the Circuit Court will have jurisdiction to deal with determinations of capacity and to make orders consequent on such declarations, including the appointment of suitable persons authorised to take decisions on specified matters in support of the person lacking capacity; provide, in circumstances where it is not possible for a person to exercise their capacity even with support, that another person appointed by the Court may act as their representative; clarify the law for carers who take on responsibility for persons who lack capacity; establish an Office of Public Guardian, with supervisory powers to protect vulnerable persons; and subsume into the Bill the provisions in the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 on enduring powers in order to bring them into line with the general principles and safeguards in the Bill.  Drafting of the Bill is being finalised with a view to publication early in the New Year.</p></reply>

Niall Molloy at Clara, County Offaly, in July 1985; if he will accede to the request by the family for an independent inquiry into the priest's death; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[54353/12]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100078#WRA01400"><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the examination referred to by the Deputy is ongoing.  The Commissioner has assured me that each and every line of inquiry is being or will be pursued.  Upon receipt of a final report from the Commissioner I will review the situation. I am fully aware of course of the many issues of concern which have been raised in the public domain surrounding the circumstances of Father Molloy&rsquo;s death and the context in which some form of inquiry has been considered desirable.  But what needs to be considered first and foremost at present is that the matters at   the heart of the Garda examination relate to potential criminal liability and, in that context, possible charges. I sympathise greatly with Father Molloy's family and understand that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep the family updated on progress.    However, the best form of justice for the family would be for anyone who has any criminal liability in relation to Father Molloy's tragic death to be brought to account through facing charges.  It would therefore be deeply inappropriate to do anything which could prejudice the possibility of that happening. It is also of crucial importance that the Garda&iacute; receive the fullest co-operation from any individual who can provide any information of relevance to the enquires being conducted.</p><p>  In any case where criminal behaviour is suspected it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available, through the submission of a file by the Garda&iacute; to the Director of Public Prosecutions, that persons can be brought fully to account before the Courts.  A commission or judicial investigation, or journalistic inquiries, cannot do this, nor can any other type of review, no matter how thorough or independent.  I therefore hope the Deputy will agree that, in the first instance, we need to allow the present Garda examination to proceed to its conclusion.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100078#WRA01600"><p>My Department is  aware of the decision of 13 November 2012 in the European Court of Human Rights in regard to the case of MM V United Kingdom.  The decision relates to a caution issued in Northern Ireland in the year 2000.  The Court highlighted the absence of a clear legislative framework for the collection and storage of data, and the lack of clarity as to the scope, extent and restrictions of the common law powers of the police to retain and disclose caution data. The Court also noted that the limited filtering arrangements made no distinction on the basis of the nature of the offence, the disposal in the case, the time which has elapsed since the offence took place or the relevance of the data to the employment sought.  The cumulative effect of these and other shortcomings was that the Court was not satisfied that there were sufficient safeguards in the system for retention and disclosure of criminal record data to ensure that data relating to the applicant&rsquo;s private life have not been disclosed in violation of her right to respect for her private life.</p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill will provide a clear legislative framework for disclosure.  There is provision for the disclosure of information of a person&rsquo;s caution for an offence, which would constitute &ldquo;specified information&rdquo; as defined in the Bill. Such information could only be disclosed if it was considered that the information led to a bona fide concern that the person concerned would pose a threat to a child or a vulnerable person, and that a disclosure of the information is relevant, proportionate and &ldquo;the rights of the person have been considered and taken account of in a manner that is consistent with fairness and natural justice.&quot;  The Bill is not inconsistent with the principles of this judgement and I do not consider that the Bill requires any amendment to address this issue.  It may however, be necessary to separately establish administrative procedures to delete records regarding a caution after a certain period of time. My Department is considering this issue in consultation with the Attorney General.  </p></reply>

The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with juveniles who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and it pays regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending.  It is supported by the Garda Youth Diversion Projects. </p><p>  The work of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers under the Diversion Programme is supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) through the funding and oversight of 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.  I wish to inform the Deputy that I continue to maintain responsibility for the diversion and community aspects of the work of IYJS, while my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown.  I will consult closely with my Ministerial colleague and with the Garda Commissioner in the continuing development of programmes to tackle youth crime.</p><p>  The programme has shown to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families.  I am committed to continuing the Diversion Programme this is reflected in the 2013 budget which remains similar to 2012.  Other Departments do not have a direct role in the delivery of the Diversion Programme, but they can support it indirectly by the provision of services to children in the groups most at risk.  The focus of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children and young people, youth work and cross-cutting initiatives for children.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service contribute to this work by membership, where appropriate, of various structures under the umbrella of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs including Children Services Committees and the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group.  I also have 2 nominated representatives on the National Children's Advisory Council and a representative on the National Education Welfare Board.</p><p>  An Annual Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme is published each year which gives details of the resources deployed by the Commissioner in relation to the Programme.  There are 123 Juvenile Liaison Officer (JLO) posts created comprising of 115 Garda&iacute; and 8 JLO Sergeants.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force. </p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review process.  In this context a comprehensive review of venues has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.</p><p>  The Service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not conclusively mean that the identified venues will close.  I am informed that no decision will be taken on an individual venue without prior consultation with local stakeholders and I understand that this consultation will be undertaken at an early stage in the assessment process so that all views can be fully reflected in the decision making process.  It should be noted that the final decision will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.  Under the statute I have no role or function in the matter.  It should be noted that since the Courts Service was established in 1999, 151 court venues have been closed.  I am informed that a total of 16 venues have been closed since March 2011, in the following locations: Enniscorthy,  Athenry, Ballymote, Borrisokane, Boyle, Castlecomer, Castleisland, Castletownbere, Claremorris, Ennistymon, Kiltimagh, New Ross, Portarlington, Roscrea, Shannon, and Templemore.</p><p>  The Courts Service has informed me that decisions to close a particular venue are generally taken due to its poor condition, some of which present a health and safety risk which would cost a great deal to rectify. The absence of holding cells in a number of cases is also a significant factor.  The need to operate more efficiently, particularly with regard to freeing up judicial, staff and Garda time currently spent travelling to multiple locations, is also a consideration.  I am informed that the Courts Service Board's rationalisation policy has gained operational efficiencies, saves time and continues to improve speed of access to justice.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Law Reform Commission has made detailed recommendations in its Report on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships<font color="#000080">.</font> In particular, the Commission recommends that legislative provisions be introduced to facilitate the extension of guardianship (parental responsibility) to civil partners and step-parents either by agreement with the other parties who have parental responsibility for the child or by application to court.</p><p>  With a view to comprehensively addressing this area of the law, I am presently engaged in the preparation of a Family Relationships and Childrens Bill. In that context, I am considering the Commission's specific recommendations on legislative reform, which will put same-sex couples and step-parents on an equal footing with other couples in relation to their children. I am also reviewing existing legislation worldwide addressing the issues of parentage, assisted human reproduction and surrogacy and considering the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction published by the Department of Health in 2005. Those reforms must ensure that children in lesbian or gay family units are able to form a legal connection with their non-biological parent and that kindred relationships flow from such legal connection. In particular, reform of the law is needed in the areas of guardianship, custody and access, and to ensure maintenance and inheritance rights for the children of civil partners.</p></reply>

Every effort is made to ensure that prisoners are located as close to their home as possible to facilitate visits from family and friends. However, this is not always possible for operational and security reasons. I am aware that maintaining family relationships can help to prevent prisoners re-offending and assist them to resettle successfully into their community and I am aware that International research has found that prisoners who maintain good family contact are twice as likely to have employment and housing on leaving prison and are up to six times less likely to re-offend.</p><p>  Section 35 of the 2005 Prison Rules sets out the provisions regarding prisoners contact with the outside community including through ordinary visits.  Under these rules a sentenced prisoner is entitled to one visit per week of 30 minutes duration and a remand prisoner is entitled to a visit on any weekday of 15 minutes duration. However, additional or longer visits may be granted where circumstances permit, at the Governor's discretion.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware the Irish Prison Service has recently introduced  new Guidelines on the Imposition of Disciplinary Sanctions in Accordance with the Prison Rules 2007 to provide uniformity in the use of disciplinary sanctions and procedures throughout the Irish Prison Service. Under these guidelines prisoners should not lose the right to communicate with their families and the loss of family visits is not employed as a sanction in response to a breach of prison discipline.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p><p>  While it is difficult to estimate precise savings arising from the closures, as these will vary from station to station, there will be some savings on utilities, maintenance and cost avoidance.  The objective of the closures, however, is not minor savings but significant improvements in efficiency.  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. In making that decision he has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to the community. Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division.</p><p>  The intention will be that at all times optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The revised structures will continue to support the community policing philosophy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country.</p></reply>

The Draft General Scheme is available on my Department's website, www. justice.ie.</p><p>  Under the current Garda compensation scheme awards are made by the High Court. The reliance on an adversarial approach to determine awards is costly and applicants can wait several years before they receive compensation.  All of the parties involved, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Associations, agree on the need for a revised scheme.

This role is critical notwithstanding that children living in the Direct Provision system are not in the care of the State.  All children live in a family context and their parents/guardians have primary responsibility for their care and welfare.  It should also be noted that RIA does not accommodate unaccompanied minors: they are in the care of the HSE.</p><p>  In the Direct Provision system, children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through RIA's Child Protection policy; its House Rules; its requirement that all centre staff are Garda vetted; and through the coordination role of a dedicated unit in RIA.</p><p>  RIA's Child Protection Policy is based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot;.  This policy requires, inter alia, that children must be supervised by their parents/guardians at all times and that children are not permitted to be left alone overnight.  It also provides that each centre has a designated Child Protection liaison officer who is responsible for following a referral procedure should he or she suspect that a child welfare incident has occurred. Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of, and adhere to, RIA's Child Protection Policy. The HSE has provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to each centre's designated officers and other staff members.</p><p>  The RIA House Rules set out information for residents and staff in respect of child protection and the responsibilities of all parties.  A copy of these Rules, as well as its Child Protection Policy, is available on RIA's website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i></p><p>  Staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.  This is in furtherance of RIA's policy which has as its principal aim the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in its centres.</p><p>  There is a specific unit in RIA called the Child and Family Services Unit, which is fully staffed and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  It also acts as a conduit between RIA and the HSE, the latter having statutory functions in this area.</p><p>  It should be acknowledged that the system of Direct Provision allows for a level of non-intrusive supervision of residents which would not be found in other living arrangements in the community.  Other residents, centre staff, designated liaison officers, Public Health Nurses, General Practitioners, Community and Ethnic Liaison Garda&iacute; etc. are alert to child welfare issues in centres.</p><p>  RIA acknowledges that child protection is on ongoing and evolving responsibility and that it must constantly adapt to legislative and policy changes.  In this respect, RIA is liaising with the HSE to update its Child Protection Policy in line with the recent revisions to the HSE's &#8220;Children First&#8221; published in 2011.  This will involve the re-training of the designated Child Protection liaison officers across all its centres.  RIA is also pro-actively engaging, internally and externally, in relation to, for example, putting Children First on a legislative basis as well as other associated child protection measures.</p></reply>

Such funds are paid into the Government&rsquo;s Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.</p><p>  While it has been accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion it is considered problematic for a number of reasons.</p><p>  Aside from the general concern that arises with regard to the constraint that such policies can place on the Government in terms of its overall expenditure policy, the suggestion also raises a number of practical difficulties.</p><p>  A revenue source such as the monies collected by the Bureau, which are variable and uncertain in nature, would not facilitate proper planning for any community projects. There is also the problem of additional costs which would accrue in the administration of any scheme to divert such funds to local projects and additional administrative costs without any additional revenues being generated.</p><p>  Furthermore, in the current economic climate the Exchequer could not sustain a loss of revenue without making compensatory adjustments. If the monies collected by the Bureau were to be diverted to community projects, there would inevitably be implications for any other monies those projects received from the Exchequer. Alternatively, other public expenditure programmes would have to sustain the loss.</p><p>  In the circumstances, I do not currently have any proposals to insert the type of provision suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Applications are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Under section 16 of that Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice, the names of those recommended for appointment.  The Government then decides the nomination.  Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures do not apply where a serving judge is to be appointed.</p><p>My Department is engaged in a review of the appointment procedure including consideration of the following issues: the need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence; eligibility for appointment; composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board; the appointments process; accountability in respect of its functioning; and promoting equality and diversity.</p><p>  I hope to be in a position to consider this further in the course of 2013.  Any proposal to introduce a new system of appointments would require amendments to the current legislation and would, of course, be a matter for consideration by Government in the first instance.</p><p>  Article 35.4.1<b></b>of the Constitution provides that a member of the judiciary can only be removed from their position<i> &quot;for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his removal</i>'.  The tenure of Circuit and District Judges is similarly protected by statute.  No judge has been so removed in the history of the State.</p><p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to establish a Judicial Council in order to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges.  This commitment is being given expression in the form of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board that will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill aims to provide a means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct in the form of a Judicial Conduct Committee, which will have lay representation.</p><p>  In November 2011, the Chief Justice announced that the judiciary had agreed to establish an Interim Judicial Council, pending the publication and enactment of the proposed Judicial Council Bill.  A sub-committee of the Board of the Interim Judicial Council was subsequently established to consider the 'General Scheme for a Judicial Council Bill', a version of which had been published by the previous Government in August 2010.  This sub-committee has already provided observations, which are the subject of ongoing consideration.  Recent developments will also be taken into account in the collaborative drafting process between my Department and the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.  I intend to publish the Bill in the course of 2013.</p></reply>

In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St Patrick's Institution ceased on 1st May, 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. The capital investment package approved by the Government in April this year, for the construction and improvement of facilities in Oberstown child detention schools, will result in sufficient capacity to extend the child care model of detention to all young people under the age of 18 by mid 2014.</p><p>  In addition, the feasibility of accommodating some categories of the 17 year old age group in the child detention schools before that date is being actively examined.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.80.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100079#WRB05200"><p>Section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004 provides that a non-national is required to pay a fee to the registration officer for the issue of a registration certificate. This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The fee was first introduced in 2006 and was then set at &euro;100. It was increased to &euro;150 in 2008 and has remained at that level until the latest increase came into effect on 19 November, 2012.</p><p>  The introduction of the registration fee in May, 2006 resulted from a policy decision that the fee income was required for the ongoing development of immigration services (both in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Our migrant population have made a valuable contribution to the economic, cultural and social life of Ireland and will continue to do so. However, I believe that it is not unreasonable to ask those who benefit from the immigration system to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of services and particularly so in a time when we are seeking to reduce public expenditure.  It is common practice throughout Europe to charge a fee for immigration services; in some instances these may be set at a level above the estimated direct administrative cost of the service based on the value of the service.  By comparison with many jurisdictions the current registration fee represents very good value.</p><p>  I am very conscious of the need to maintain and develop good service levels to customers. In this regard the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is undertaking a number of projects with the aim of developing and improving immigration services.  These include the introduction of a new common format EU Residence Permit for non-nationals which will replace the current registration certificate. It will provide the user with a more secure immigration document including individual biometrics indicators protected by a sophisticated encryption system and showing the holders&rsquo; immigration status in the State. This high quality secure document will be easily recognisable for employers and Government agencies.</p><p>  Furthermore, INIS as part of its reform of in-country aspects of immigration services, is developing a range of measures including on line application and appointment systems for certain services. Such a service is badly needed, but it does cost money to implement. The nature of immigration requirements such as registration necessitates, to a very great extent, the personal attendance of the applicant. At certain times of the year this can give rise to long queues and significant delays. A self-selecting on-line system will help to greatly alleviate these difficulties and the increased registration fee income will be used to meet a portion of the cost involved in this and other developments.</p><p>  Other projects being progressed are proposals for the civilianisation of certain port of entry functions at Dublin Airport. For this purpose, a trial is underway at Dublin airport to test the feasibility of a new model for delivery of immigration services at ports of entry to the State by using a combination of civilian staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I refer the Deputy to my answer to D&aacute;il Question No. 171 of 4th October, 2012 which sets out the latest position in respect of this project.</p><p>  The fee increase itself will be used to defray some of the costs of providing and developing these services to migrants.</p><p>  While there is no specific requirement to do so, advance notice of the fee increase was placed on the INIS website and displayed in the Public Office in Burgh Quay. It is an unavoidable consequence that people seeking to register will fall on either side of the fee increase introduction.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should point out that in recognition of the circumstances of certain categories of person, there are specific exemptions from paying the registration fee set out in the regulations; these are the following: UN Convention Refugees; Family members of such refugees who have been admitted to the State in accordance with section  18 of the Refugee Act 1996; Persons who are under 18 years of age at the time of registration; Spouses, civil partners, widows and widowers of Irish citizens; Spouses and Dependants of EU nationals who receive a residence permit under EU Directive 38/04; Programme Refugees, as defined by section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996; Persons subject to arrangements for victims of human trafficking.  The above categories of non-nationals exempted from the fee payment are almost 20% of the total numbers registering. Last year alone, this amounted to 21,443 persons and &euro;3.2 million in fees waived.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.84.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100080#WRC00300"><p>The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) Report, which was launched in September, summarises many of the criticisms which have been made of the Direct Provision system since its inception over 12 years ago, concentrating specifically on issues relating to children. The report makes a number of recommendations for change to the direct provision system.  Some of the recommendations - such as allowing asylum seekers work after 12 months, reinstating child benefit, allowing residents to choose and prepare meals themselves - are at odds with long standing Government policy in dealing with the issue of asylum, a key pillar of which is the Direct Provision system. I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.</p><p>  In relation to children living in a safe environment, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, charged with running the Direct Provision system, takes the issue of child welfare, and the protection of residents generally, very seriously.  All staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's Children Protection policy.  One recommendation in the IRC report refers to the need for accommodation centres to be in good condition and that heating, hot water and cleanliness should be guaranteed.  This recommendation is, in fact, a condition to be met by all contracted to provide accommodation. RIA has in place contractual obligations in this regard, backed up by an inspection system which has been described in answers to previous D&aacute;il Questions.</p><p>  The report recommends that RIA should consult with families in relation to their religious and cultural needs before being dispersed to an accommodation centre.  RIA does not, and will not, designate centres as being specifically for one ethnic or cultural group.  The key objective for RIA is the provision of accommodation and coordination of services to asylum seekers who would otherwise be homeless. The system must operate within the inevitable constraint that RIA can only accommodate persons in centres where suitable vacancies exist.  RIA will always consult management in accommodation centres who have knowledge of local services and who will advise newly arrived persons of cultural and religious facilities in the area.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of space generally, including the sharing of bedrooms and toilet facilities, there are a number of things to be said. Firstly, in sourcing accommodation RIA must ensure that the basic legal conditions, in terms of capacity and toilet and bathroom facilities, are met.  Secondly, in relation to room sharing, where it comes to RIA's attention that accommodation is not suitable for a family where, for example, its size has increased, alternative accommodation in another centre is offered.  In some cases, this offer is not accepted and families prefer to stay in a centre. Thirdly, in relation to families having to share bathrooms, a majority of families living in the system have sole access to their own bathroom and toilet facilities. Whilst the nature of Direct Provision is such that en suite facilities are not guaranteed, RIA will continue to seek over time to increase the percentage of families having access to non-shared bathroom/toilet facilities.</p><p>  In relation to the recommendation regarding education, in addition to all asylum seeker children being able to avail of mainstream primary and secondary education, they may also avail of the Department of Social Protection's Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance. Further supports are provided to families through the Community Welfare service in the form of Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP's) to address once-off needs, including funding child-related activities. Children in pre-school year also avail of free placements in pre-schools under the Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme. Pre-schools are available on-site at some of the larger centres but the choice of pre-school under the scheme is a matter for the individual parents to decide.  In relation to the recommendation regarding homework space, all family centres with school going children are asked to set aside a quiet space where children can do their homework under parental supervision.</p><p>  In terms of play spaces for children, the Direct Provision system is roughly analogous to other types of accommodation where children would reside, be it houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some centres have on-site playgrounds and some do not. Children in centres can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.   Centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGOs to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Many centres will, for example, facilitate parties and will also facilitate NGOs who organise outings etc.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system has been subject to criticism since its inception, and every effort is made to improve the system.  RIA welcomes scrutiny in this regard. But it important also to acknowledge that no asylum seeker who has sought international protection from this State has ever been left homeless; that residents get nourishment on a par with, and in some cases superior to, that available  to the general population; that they receive a health service on the same basis as Irish citizens; and that children are provided with primary and secondary education in the local community on the same basis as the children of Irish citizens.</p><p>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, particularly the complexity and length of the associated processes, my efforts are concentrated on<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>speeding up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which I plan to progress in 2013 provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

Rule 59 of the 2007 prison rules provides that a prisoner is eligible by good conduct to earn a remission of sentence not exceeding one quarter. Rule 59(2) allows for the discretionary granting of remission in excess of one quarter but not exceeding one third where a prisoner has shown good conduct by engaging in authorised structured activity<b></b>and as a result is less likely to offend and better able to reintegrate into the community.  The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release is fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.</p><p>  The legislation sets out clearly the purpose of temporary release, the situations in which it may be granted and the criteria to apply  to decisions to grant temporary release.  Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. Each application is considered on its individual merits and evaluated using the following criteria as outlined in the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed; the period of the sentence served by the person; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release; any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.</p><p>  I announced my intention last year to enact legislation to place the interim Parole Board on a statutory footing which I believe will help to strengthen the Board and improve its functions.  My Department is currently considering exactly what role a statutory Parole Board should play, what powers it should have, and the implications of same with a view to preparing the Heads of a Bill.  An all encompassing strategic review of penal policy is also underway which is examining all aspects of penal policy including prevention, sentencing policies, alternatives to custody, accommodation and regimes, support for reintegration and rehabilitation and the issue of female offenders.  I will consider the options when that review has been completed.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not the sole authority charged with the investigation of fraud type offences. In this regard the organisation works on an ongoing basis with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Competition Authority. The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is a specialist bureau that investigates fraud-related crime involving serious and complex cases of commercial fraud, cheque and payment card fraud, counterfeit currency, money laundering, computer crime and breaches of the Companies Acts and the Competition Act.  There are 80 personnel assigned to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation including 9 members on temporary transfer from the Dublin region. There are two forensic accountants employed full time at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p><p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau, which has 35 personnel assigned to it, has also been active in targeting the proceeds of deception, fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption and other types of criminal activity sometimes referred to as &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;.

At that point, as a general policy, they are transferred to asylum accommodation centres under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.</p><p>  The care of all children in the Direct Provision System is of the utmost importance including those coming up to the age of 18. In this regard, RIA has an agreed policy in place with the HSE which deals with the transition of 'aged out minors. Details are contained on RIA's website www.ria.gov.ie. Before such transfers take place, detailed discussions take place between the Separated Children's Team in the HSE and RIA to ensure the best RIA centre match for the aged out minor concerned.  It should be noted that the majority of aged out minors being discharged from the HSE care are transferred from foster care arrangements provided by the HSE throughout the State.  RIA currently has 35 centres in 17 counties throughout the State and it is often the case that aged out minors do not transfer to areas where they had been in foster care.</p><p>  The issue of aged out minors remaining in foster home care is a matter for the HSE.

Having said that, I welcome the fact that it is a clear recognition of the capacity for Northern Ireland to host such a high profile event.  Naturally, security will be an important element of the planning for this event.  I have said on many occasions since taking office of Minister that cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI is excellent.  That will continue to be the case and will make security planning all the more comprehensive and effective.  Of course the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the detail of policing arrangements for this event.

I have no role in this area and, accordingly, I am not in a position to indicate the stations to which the new vehicles will be allocated.  At Garda Divisional level, it is for the Chief Superintendent to make appropriate arrangements for the distribution of vehicles throughout the Division, in response to policing demands. The detailed allocation of vehicles is determined through a process of ongoing analysis.</p><p>  However, I understand from the Garda authorities that, as a result of the recent investment of &euro;3 million in the Garda fleet, arrangements are currently being made for the delivery of the 170 new Garda vehicles which have been purchased . It is anticipated that these vehicles will begin to come on stream over the coming weeks. The most recent order brings the number of new vehicles ordered this year to over 210 at a cost of approximately &euro;4 million.  I am also advised by the Garda authorities that 243 vehicles were withdrawn from service between January and November this year.</p><p>  I am conscious of the need to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, the operational effectiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is for that reason that a further &euro;5 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  This level of expenditure, at a time of severe budgetary constraint, represents a very significant investment in Garda transport and I have no doubt that the additional funding   will considerably strengthen the overall effectiveness of the Force in delivering a policing service to communities throughout the country.  I am also confident that, when the relevant budgetary figures are being determined for 2014, the importance of investment in Garda transport will continue to be recognised.</p></reply>

The vast majority of the funding was made available through once off grant schemes which were administered by Pobal and were funded from Dormant Accounts monies.  One example of such a scheme was &quot;Enhancing Disability Services Funding&quot; (EDS) for voluntary, not for profit organisations, working in the Irish disability sector. Funding in this case was provided from Dormant Accounts monies under the Multi-Annual Investment Programme as announced in Budget 2005.   This funding was provided over five years for disability groups and organisations operating at national / regional level who provided details of once-off  projects which showed an innovative, efficient and cost-effective approach to service provision for people with disabilities and which had the capacity to be main streamed in the future.  Many worthwhile projects emerged from the programme, with benefits to both participants and the formulation of policy and practice for the future.</p><p>  Another example was  &quot;The Independent Living Support Programme&quot; (ILSP)  for which funding was provided and administered over the period 2007/ 2008 by my Department and which assisted voluntary organisations and service providers, who worked with people with disabilities, to purchase practical supports which enabled independent living for such people.  Other grant funding was provided by my Department to Disability organisations and groups over this period for example to, People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI) and Vantastic to assist them to provide services to PWDs. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, provides funding to Vantastic since I passed over the funding of this organisation to him at the end of 2010. Additionally, funding was provided by my Department to disability organisations and groups over this period of time to fund awareness raising initiatives.</p><p>YEAR-AMOUNT PAID</p><p>2003-&euro;1,668,448</p><p>2004-&euro;2,036,861</p><p>2005-&euro;2,489,366</p><p>2006-&euro;2,054,159</p><p>2007-&euro;6,637,937</p><p>2008-&euro;5,749,056</p><p>2009-&euro;3,543,393</p><p>2010-&euro;1,491,309</p><p>2011-&euro;1,111,000</p><p>2012-&euro;75,757</p><p>TOTAL- &euro;23,151,977</p></reply>

The salary payable to a District Court Judge appointed prior to 1 January 2012 is &#8364;136,124.  Judges' pensions are calculated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions and paid from Central Funds.  Pensions in respect of District Judges are payable at 65 years based on 1/40th of salary per year of service up to a maximum period of twenty years.  A gratuity is calculated at 3/40ths of salary per year of service up to a maximum of 1.5 times salary.  Under the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended), a judge who has served a minimum of two years may apply for a preserved pension on reaching 65 years.  Alternatively, a judge over the age of 60 who has served a minimum of two years may apply for Cost Neutral Early Retirement (provided for in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012).

Such decision making is also guided by, among other things, international law and Supreme and High Court Judgments. The ultimate decision will be to make a Deportation Order or to grant Leave to Remain in the State for a specified period and subject to stated conditions.</p><p>  The consideration of cases under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) is a resource intensive process. It is not, however, possible to provide an average waiting time for the processing of such cases primarily because no two cases will be the same in terms of their nature or complexity.

Additionally, the current multi-layered approach to the processing of cases of asylum origin means that persons who claim asylum, and have their claims refused, almost invariably proceed to lodge an application for Subsidiary Protection and if this is also refused, their ultimate position in the State must then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. This multi-layered approach is clearly not resource efficient, nor applicant friendly, and that is why I am providing for a single-procedure based approach in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I plan to progress in 2013. This proposed single-procedure will require applicants to advance, at the outset, all reasons, protection or otherwise, behind their request to stay in the State. As a result, the days of the multi-layered approach to dealing with such cases will cease.</p><p>  Finally, I might add that I recently approved an initiative to put in place a panel with legal expertise who will assist the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in processing a cohort of repatriation cases thus speeding up the overall process and reducing the time spent by persons in the Direct Provision system. I would expect to see significant dividends from this initiative in the coming months.<blockquote><i>Extract from PQ No. 540 of 27th November, 2012</i><br /><br /><i>The processing of cases at the repatriation stage is a complex one with obligations to adhere to both domestic and international law and to make decisions in accordance with the UN Convention on Human Rights.   The process can be a lengthy one often punctuated with judicial reviews taken by the applicants at various stages including at deportation stage.  Accordingly, not all cases fit neatly into particular categories.  For example, in the case of families, one member of the family may have lodged a judicial review which in turn may mean that the remainder of the family may not be processed until its outcome is determined.   In addition, some applicants may also be party to an application under EU Treaty Rights or through marriage to an Irish citizen or may have been granted leave to remain as a result of these applications.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide figures in respect of the remainder of the case load without engaging in a very detailed exercise which could not be justified as it would divert resources from case processing.  </i></blockquote></p></reply>

The Scheme provides, inter alia, for the introduction of attachment of earnings to recover unpaid fines from a person's earnings.  The Scheme also recasts a number of the key provisions in the Fines Act 2010, including those relating to the payment of fines by instalments (section 15).  Whereas under the 2010 Act, a person had to apply to the court to be permitted to pay a fine by instalments, the Scheme provides that this will become an automatic right.  Given this significant change to the nature and scope of the instalment provisions in the Act, it is not my intention to commence section 15 until after it has been amended.  I hope that it will be possible to enact the Fines (Amendment) Bill during 2013.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.</p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. </p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.</p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.</p><p>  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public. My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided. I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.</p><p>  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy. the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years, with significant increases in the number of sentenced prisoners and those being committed on remand, as well as a trend towards longer sentences.  It should also be recognised, however, that while the problem of prison overcrowding remains a challenging issue, and action is being taken on a number of fronts to address that issue, Ireland traditionally has had a low rate of imprisonment.  </p><p>  It can be difficult to make direct and accurate comparisons with the penal systems in other countries, but it is worth noting that the latest Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics published last March show that France has a higher number of persons in prison per 100,000 inhabitants  (103.5)  than Ireland (97.4) and a higher occupancy rate of 108.4% compared to Ireland's rate of 101.7 %.</p><p>  I have no proposals along the lines suggested by the Deputy, but a strategic review of penal policy is underway and I will consider all of the options that emerge from that review.</p></reply>

There is a public perception that undue secrecy is attached to the administration of this area of the law and that there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which it is administered.  The Bill, which is being drafted for publication in the current session, will make court proceedings in family law and child care cases more transparent.</p></reply>

International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 29 of 1930 defines forced labour as &quot;all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself voluntarily&quot;.</p><p>  Although forced labour covers a diverse range of exploitative behaviours, it is difficult to foresee circumstances where an incident of forced labour would not be liable to prosecution in this jurisdiction under a range of offences, including for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.  In addition the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation, including forced labour. For the purposes of the Act, the term &quot;trafficks&quot; is broadly defined. For example, the commission of the offence does not require cross-border (or even internal) movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing accommodation or employment.</p><p>  In the context of a recent review of the potential of the 2008 legislation to combat the phenomenon of forced labour <i>per se</i> , the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations was asked for its views on whether Ireland's human trafficking legislation is sufficiently wide in scope to encompass forced labour as defined in ILO Convention No. 29 of 1930. The ILO Committee of Experts is of the view that it is. However, the committee has also pointed to the fact that the 2008 Act does not provide a definition of forced labour. Therefore, it has recommended, for the purpose of clarity, that forced labour be defined in accordance with the ILO Convention. Subject to Government approval for the necessary legislation, I propose to provide this clarification by way of an amendment to the 2008 Act, at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

It reflects their core values of justice and fairness and represents a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people to assist some of the world&rsquo;s poorest communities.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger, and it is consistently rated as one of the most effective internationally.  It is strongly focused on the poorest countries and communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, prioritising investments in the areas of education, health, good governance, food security and nutrition. </p><p>  The Government takes the view that our work with developing countries is morally right, but that it is also in our interests as a country with a small open economy in an increasingly interconnected world.  Many developing countries have shown remarkable economic progress in recent years and our untied development assistance today will undoubtedly result in access to markets in the future.  The Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade clearly recognises the role that aid has played in empowering broader economic and social development on the continent, and commits us to a comprehensive approach to Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Africa &ndash; in development, politically and in the building of mutually beneficial economic links. </p><p>  This year, the Government has provided some &euro;639 million in total Official Development Assistance (ODA).  In 2013, it is anticipated that ODA will amount to &euro;623 million, a modest reduction, but one which comes on top of an overall reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s ODA levels of over 30% since 2008.  While this is a very significant sum, it still represents slightly less than 50 cent in every &euro;100 we will earn as a country in 2013.  </p><p>  The Government remain strongly committed to the aid programme and to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for Overseas Development Assistance.  However, in the current difficult economic circumstances, it is clear that further progress towards this target will only be possible when sustained economic growth has been restored to the Irish economy.</p></reply>

We have been advocating strongly against the adoption of the proposed law. I raised the issue directly with President Museveni when I visited Uganda in July and I asked our Ambassador in Kampala to continue to follow developments closely.  She and a group of EU Ambassadors outlined our serious concerns in a recent meeting with the Prime Minister of Uganda.  The regular structured EU political dialogue with the Government of Uganda also provides an important opportunity to highlight our concerns directly.  </p><p>  In our dealings with the Government of Uganda we have made the case that the passing of any such legislation would be in conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s international human rights obligations and would have a detrimental effect on the country&rsquo;s relations with its international development partners, including Ireland. The position of the Government of Uganda on the proposed law is that it was presented as a private member&rsquo;s Bill and is not part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  President Museveni has made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&rsquo;s international relations and reputation.  </p><p>  We, and our EU and other international partners, remain committed to ensuring that the citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation, including through our role as a member of the UN Human Rights Council. Our Embassy in Uganda will continue to monitor developments closely in the coming weeks.</p><p>  In relation to our development cooperation funding for Uganda, this has been provided for agreed programmes in the social, health and education sectors, through a number of channels.  The programmes are regularly examined and evaluated to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money. As the Deputy will be aware, I have suspended all Irish Aid funding for programmes delivered through the Government of Uganda as a result of the misappropriation of funds intended for the Peace, Recovery and Development Programme.  Until these funds are restored and we are fully confident that the authorities have strengthened internal financial controls and acted against all officials implicated in the fraud, the suspension of all funding through the Government of Uganda will remain in place. </p></reply>

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, have also been very active in pursuit of progress in this difficult case.     I met with the person&rsquo;s spouse, daughter and other family representatives of the person mentioned by the Deputy on 29 February 2012.  The person&rsquo;s spouse and other family representatives also met with the Head of the Consular Division on 28 May 2012.  As a result of these meetings I once again wrote to the Sri Lankan Minister of External Affairs on 18 June 2012, urging on behalf of the Government of Ireland that the person mentioned by the Deputy be either released or charged at the earliest opportunity.  I also informed the Minister of External Affairs that I would like to personally meet with him in the margins of any international meeting at which we are both present, to discuss the case, should the opportunity arise.  A response to my letter is awaited.</p><p>The Sir Lankan authorities have confirmed that the person named by the Deputy is being detained under emergency legislation relating to the prevention of terrorism.  The case of the person mentioned by the Deputy has been raised with the EU Delegation in Colombo.  My Department will continue to liaise   with the EU Delegation and follow developments closely.  I intend writing to Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to seek her assistance on the human rights aspects of the case.</p><p>  Sri Lanka underwent its Universal Periodic Review, or UPR, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on the 1st of November this year. In advance questions to Sri Lanka, Ireland raised the issue of legal safeguards for persons suspected or charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, stressing the importance of trials taking place within a reasonable time frame. Ireland also requested information on any actions taken or plans to begin a process of reintegration for those in detention following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka in May 2009, or information on any plans to begin legal proceedings in accordance with due process against those in detention. Finally, Ireland recommended that the Government of Sri Lanka take steps to ensure that all detainees are afforded a fair trial within a reasonable time period.</p><p>  There has been a significant development in the case in the past few days where his lawyers informed the person&rsquo;s family that the Sri Lankan authorities would formally charge him on Monday 10 December 2012.  When, he appeared before the court, the case was postponed to Tuesday, 18 December 2012.  Our Embassy in New Delhi has been informed of this and, while they are precluded from intervening in any way in judicial proceedings, they will continue to provide all possible consular assistance.</p><p>  I am most conscious and concerned about the fact that the person mentioned by the Deputy has now spent five years in detention without charge.  I can assure the Deputy that I and my officials will render all possible consular assistance.</p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and in close liaison with Irish-American community representatives, our contacts with the US Administration and Congress will intensify even further over the coming weeks and months with a view to ensuring that the interests and concerns of undocumented Irish immigrants are fully reflected in any future legislative deal that emerges in this area.

Other languages appear in a much smaller degree in the text on the data and observation pages of the book.  The text and format of this print meets ICAO standards and is consistent with best international practice.</p><p>  In terms of the name that can appear on a passport, Section 10 of the Passports Act, 2008 (the Act) broadly provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his/her birth certificate.  If the Irish form of the name is registered on the birth certificate, then this is the name which would appear on the passport.  However, name change from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act for example in situations such as marriage.</p><p>  Moreover, where the requested name to appear on the passport is the Irish version of the English registered birth name, the Passport Service requires evidence of the use of this new name and identity over a two year period.  There is discretion under the Act in terms of the two year proof of usage requirement.  While such discretion has been normally applied in the past in cases of domestic abuse etc, care must be taken to mitigate the risk that name change requests are being used for identity swapping purposes.  Such activity would put the high international regard for the integrity of the Irish passport at risk.</p><p>  The Passport Service has put in place an alternative option to assist citizens who wish to use the Irish form of his/her name, but who lack the necessary two years proof of use.

It is providing advice to Government Departments in relation to a range of financial activities in these commercial State companies including investment proposals, corporate plans, capital expenditure projects, financial statements, funding proposals and other items required by statute and by the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.   It is also assisting from a financial perspective in the development and implementation of Government plans for investment in energy, water and next-generation telecommunications and is working closely with the relevant Government Departments in these areas.</p><p>  In addition, where requested by Government, it is carrying out advisory and oversight roles in relation to the possible restructuring or disposal of commercial State company assets. NewERA&rsquo;s role in these disposal processes is to assist and advise the relevant Government Departments in representing the Government&rsquo;s financial interests in the context of assets disposals and to ensure that Government-agreed timelines and financial objectives are clearly communicated to the relevant parties. It is also the responsibility of NewERA to ensure that the Government Steering Group overseeing the transactions is kept fully informed of progress and developments with the goal of ensuring that the financial objectives of the process are achieved.

The Directive provides for the reinforcement and harmonisation of the statutory audit function throughout the EU.  It clarifies the duties of statutory auditors and provides for their independence and ethical standards; introduces a requirement for external quality assurance; provides for public oversight of the audit profession, including third country auditors, and improved cooperation between oversight bodies in the EU. It also provides a basis for international cooperation between regulators in the EU and in third countries. It also requires listed companies to set up an audit committee with clear functions to perform.</p><p>  By means of S.I. No. 220 of 20th May, 2010, effect was given to those aspects of Directive 2006/43/EC not already provided for in Company Law.  </p><p>  In relation to financial regulatory practices, the Central Bank Reform Act 2010,  replaced the previously related bodies, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, with a single unitary body, the Central Bank of Ireland (the Bank) and provided for new powers to be exercised by the Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p><p>  Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill was published in July 2011. The bill enhances the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad, and strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The bill also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 is expected to be enacted in the first quarter of 2013.</p><p>  During 2011, the Bank updated its action plan for strengthening supervision of credit institutions across a comprehensive range of areas. As part of its supervisory work, the Bank launched PRISM (Probability Risk and Impact System), its new risk assessment framework which establishes a new adaptive approach for supervisory engagement with regulated firms.</p><p>  The Bank published a revised Consumer Protection Code in October 2011. The review of the Code, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, represents the most significant strengthening of protections for consumers of financial institutions since the launch of the initial Code in August 2006.</p><p>  The Central Bank advises me that its regulatory activity has intensified with increases in staff numbers and skill levels. The Central Bank has also taken a number of measures under its &quot;Banking Supervision - our new approach&quot; to banking supervision which they introduced in June 2010 and updated in June 2011:</p><p>-During 2011 the Central Bank has re-organised its internal banking supervision structures.</p><p>-The Central Bank has invested heavily in training all supervisory staff.</p><p>-A panel of risk advisors with specialist and industry expertise has been in operation since September 2010.</p></reply>

Relief was initially granted but, due to changes to mortgage interest relief rules, was ceased with effect from June 2009. Revenue wrote to the person in question at that time to establish continued entitlement to the relief in line with the revised mortgage interest relief rules. However no response was received and no further relief was granted.   The person in question made a further application for mortgage interest relief in respect of the same loan on 4 October 2012. On receipt of the new application Revenue made contact with the person to further clarify details in relation to the loan and having received the necessary information recommenced payment of the mortgage interest relief.

According to an Autumn 2012 Report from IDA Ireland, 146,000 people are directly employed by multinationals in Ireland, and the total of direct and indirect jobs attributable to multinationals is around 250,000.</p><p>  The corporation tax responsibilities of multinationals in Ireland are clear: all companies in Ireland pay the 12.5% rate on their trading profits which are generated in Ireland.  </p><p>  I am, however, aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways that some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their global tax costs.  The ability of entities to lower their global rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and indeed all countries operate.  Ireland is fully supportive of international efforts to ensure fairness in taxation.  Ireland participates fully in the EU Code of Conduct Group, which addresses harmful tax competition, and in the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.</p><p>  In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, I would emphasise that it is for the Public Accounts Committee to organise their own schedule of work.</p></reply>

The developments noted in 2010 do reflect, inter alia, the closure of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and the transfer of outstanding loans to its parent in the UK.  </p><p>  All issues highlighted by the Deputy refer to changes in outstanding amounts on the statistical balance sheet of credit institutions in the State, and by themselves do not reflect wholly household deleveraging.

Moneylenders have to apply to the Central Bank each year for renewal of the licence. In addition to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, a licensed moneylender must comply with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders (the Code) and with the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010. </p><p>  I have been advised by the Central Bank that, as at 29 November 2012, there are 44 licensed moneylenders. </p><p>  Compliance with the terms and conditions of the licence is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Central Bank through supervision, themed inspections, mystery shopping, consumer intelligence and complaints from the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of the licence may lead to proceedings under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Administrative Sanctions Procedures, which enable the Central Bank to sanction and fine regulated entities for breaches of regulatory requirements.  Since 1 December 2011, licensed moneylenders are also subject to a fitness and probity regime. The Central Bank undertook a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders in 2010. The main findings were that, overall there was a high level of compliance among firms and that consumers were charged in accordance with moneylenders&rsquo; authorised APRs and costs of credit. The Central Bank carried out another themed inspection of moneylenders recently and is currently finalising reports. </p><p>  Interest rates charged are not regulated by the Central Bank so each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, including risk. Interest rate caps for moneylenders are not provided for in the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  As the Deputy is aware, I mentioned in the House on 18 July 2012, at the conclusion of the debate on the Private Members' Bill on the issue of capping the interest rate charged by licensed moneylenders, that I would draw to the attention of the Governor of the Central Bank, the concerns and points raised during the debate. I have received a reply from the Governor and its contents are being examined. </p><p>  The Central Bank endeavours to increase disclosure and understanding of the costs associated with loans provided by moneylenders and the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders requires the disclosure of the all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner. Prior to entering into a loan agreement with a consumer where the APR is 23% or higher, the licensed moneylender must prominently display that fact and use the words typed in high font: &lsquo;Warning: This is a high-cost loan.&rsquo; </p><p>  I have been informed by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, that persons operating as illegal moneylenders are in breach of the law.  It is a matter for An Garda Siochana to investigate their activities.  Under Section 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, An Garda Siochana have sole responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of such offences. The Central Bank has no function or power in this regard.  If the Central Bank has reason to believe that a person is operating as an illegal moneylender, the matter is reported to An Garda Siochana.   The latest available figures provided by the Courts Service, as at 1 November 2012, indicate that no prosecutions for illegal moneylending have been recorded over the past five years.</p></reply>

The incentive amnesty related to outstanding tax, levy and health contribution liabilities in respect of income and/or capital gains of individuals for the period up to and including 5th April 1991.  The incentive amnesty did not cover PAYE or PRSI liabilities.  Any PRSI liabilities had to be paid directly by the individuals concerned to the then Department of Social Welfare.</p><p>  The general amnesty applied to all outstanding taxes in respect of individuals and companies for the period up to and including 5th April 1991.

Furthermore, the Cabinet handbook requires a statement on the likely effects of the decision sought on equality and persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion to be included in Memoranda to Government.  Consequently, Government does consider each of these important issues at an individual policy or programme level. I would also remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies take the provisions of equality legislation into account in the development and delivery of its policies and services.</p><p>  In addition, a distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on various income levels for the different categories of income earners, for example single individuals, married one-earner couples with no children and married one-earner couples with children.  A distributional analysis which models the impacts on disposable income by income decile using SWITCH, the ESRI Tax-Benefit model, is also undertaken in evaluating various budgetary options.  Illustrative examples are contained in the Budget 2013 document.</p><p>  With regard to Regulatory Impact Analysis, although it can potentially benefit all policy areas/regulations, it is not compulsory to apply RIA to the Finance Bill. Generally speaking, the revenue measures I introduced as part of Budget 2013 will be given legislative effect through the forth coming Finance Bill.  As detailed in the guidelines the publication of a RIA may not be appropriate in the case of tax law/regulations or the imposition of charges because of their sensitivity and the need to guard against possible evasion or avoidance.</p><p>  Nonetheless, the Revenue Commissioners have an ongoing focus on minimising the administrative burden on business and have recently reported to Government that they have reduced the burden by 25%, saving business over &euro;85 million a year.  Furthermore the latest World Bank report shows that Ireland continues to be the easiest country in the EU in which to pay business taxes.</p><p>  The primary objective of Budget 2013 was to reduce further the deficit in our public finances in line with our commitments, since it is not sustainable to continue running such large deficits.  The measures introduced within the Budget are deemed necessary in order to reduce further the deficit in the public finances and so as to ensure continued adherence to fiscal targets set as part of the EU/IMF Programme. </p><p>  The Government has sought to implement the measures required to reduce the deficit in a manner that was as fair and equitable as possible and in a manner that would protect the emerging economic recovery.  While this is a difficult task and one which has required that difficult decisions be made by Government, I am satisfied that we are implementing the necessary adjustments in such a manner.</p></reply>

This means that a loan will have to be drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 in order to qualify for this relief.  I have no plans to review this decision and I believe that more than adequate notice of this decision has been provided.  As with all time-limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible with the legislation within the current budgetary constraints.  However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further.</p><p>  As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  You will also appreciate that I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current significant budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The position is that in general, individuals whose income is taxed under the PAYE system are not required to submit a tax return annually because by and large it is not necessary.  As the Deputy will be aware, the PAYE system successfully operates to deduct the correct amount of tax in a seamless way from the vast bulk of PAYE employees and pensioners, and their taxable income is reported to Revenue by the employer/pension provider after the end of the tax year.  In addition, I am advised that the current practice of the Revenue Commissioners is to issue annual returns to specific groups of PAYE taxpayers whom they regard as potentially higher risk cases.  To my mind, this is an efficient and appropriate approach to this matter.  The alternative would require up to 2 million people to prepare and submit tax returns for no obvious benefit, and I would be concerned about the administrative and cost burden on both taxpayers and Revenue if the law was changed to make it mandatory for all PAYE employees to file an annual tax return.</p><p>  Regarding State pensioners, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of taxpayers do report details of their State pension entitlements to Revenue, even though they are not obliged to file an annual tax return but, in any event, Revenue now receives information on pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  This data exchange allows for the automatic deduction of tax by employers and pension providers on these pensions in appropriate cases.</p><p>  Finally, mandatory tax returns would be unlikely to remove the need for means testing, given that means and income are not necessarily the same. However, the Revenue Commissioners further advise that they are currently working with one Government Department and one public sector agency, both of whom conduct means-testing for State benefits to develop an interface that will allow those organisations get a full picture of all income returned to Revenue by the person concerned.</p></reply>

One of its features is that the State Junior Certificate examination will be replaced, in a phased manner over the next eight years, by a new school-based approach to assessment in line with best practice internationally.  The Framework includes a number of measures to support and quality assure standards for the school based assessment across the three years of junior cycle.  The Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination, unlike the GCSE in England and Wales, as the vast majority of Junior Certificate students progress on to senior cycle and present for the Leaving Certificate examination at the end of senior cycle.</p><p>  The State Examinations Commission will provide final assessment papers and marking schemes for subjects until the new school-based system of assessment is established.  For English, Irish and mathematics they will continue in the interim to also mark the examination papers.  The NCCA is developing an Assessment and Moderation Toolkit that teachers, students and parents can use to support the new emphasis on school-based assessment.  A comprehensive professional development service will be provided from 2013/2014 for teachers of each subject as the new specifications for the Framework are phased in from 2014-2017.  The CPD will cover new approaches to teaching and learning but particular attention will be given to assessment modes which include both assessment for learning and assessment of learning.</p></reply>

This will include the development of formal guidelines, criteria and procedures pursuant to the new Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.</p><p>  It is anticipated that new applications will be accepted by QQI from Spring 2013.</p></reply>

Contracting authorities must be cost effective and efficient in the use of resources while upholding the highest standards of probity and integrity.</p><p>  The Guidelines require a competitive process carried out in an open, objective and transparent manner to achieve best value for money in public procurement. This is in line with EU Treaty principles and EU Directives on public procurement.</p><p>  Essential principles to be observed in conducting all procurement functions include non &ndash; discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, mutual recognition, proportionality, freedom to provide service and freedom of establishment. The Directives impose legal obligations on public bodies in regard to advertising and the use of objective tendering procedures for contracts above certain value thresholds. The estimated cost of the development at the school to which the Deputy refers is above the relevant threshold.</p><p>  School Building Projects, including the one referred to by the Deputy, are tendered in compliance with the above requirements. While building projects, by their nature, generally contribute to economic activity in the locality in which they are carried out, my Department does not regard it as feasible to use the Public Works Contracts to require contractors to use local labour or materials.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that there will be a smaller number of centres for ITE offering education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.</p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.</p><p>  I will consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received and a further announcement will be made at that stage.</p></reply>

The 5 Year Construction Plan that I announced on 9 March last outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan. It is not possible therefore at this point to indicate when a project for the school in question will be progressed.</p></reply>

The budget measure introduced for the current school year that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. It is also worth pointing out that, as part of last years budgetary measures, my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.</p><p>  Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.</p><p>  The day to day management of how teaching resources are used in schools is done at local school level. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students.</p></reply>

The Guidelines, which are being launched shortly, were developed by a Working Group with representation from Teacher Education Section/Inspectorate, SPHE Support Service, National Psychological Service (NEPS) all from this Department along with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive/National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP).  The NOSP and the DES funded their development.</p><p>  The Guidelines were developed following a process of wide consultation with key education partners and are informed by the findings of the consultation process and recent research.  The Guidelines provide practical guidance on how post-primary schools can promote mental health and well-being and school connectedness in an integrated way, which are critical to young people's success in school and in life. The Guidelines also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. Information is also provided in the Guidelines relating to accessing support from external agencies and support services.</p><p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They will also be useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.</p><p>  The key to successful implementation of these Guidelines lies in taking a coordinated whole-school approach. This involves building and integrating school self-evaluation processes, implementing the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, developing the whole-school guidance plan, adopting the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support, and building effective inter-agency relationships.</p><p>  The Guidelines draw together the various elements that provide for effective student support and build on the significant work already taking place in schools.  They provide a clear framework for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of mental health promotion and suicide prevention. Mental health promotion and the provision of supports for vulnerable students depend on ongoing cooperation between schools and the range of available services and agencies from the education, health and community sectors.</p><p>  The European wide Health Promoting School Process (HPS) is outlined and the Guidelines show how the HPS may be adopted by schools to constantly strengthen its capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.</p><p>  In addition, in the new Framework for Junior Cycle which I launched in October, &quot;Wellbeing&quot; is one of the 8 principles which underpin the Framework. Through a student's experience in Junior Cycle, I want the student to be able to take actions to safeguard and promote  his/ her wellbeing and that of others.</p></reply>

Queries in relation to underspends within individual Departments should be directed to the relevant Minister and his/her Department.</p><p>  The most up to date figures for the forecast outturn of net voted capital estimates in 2012 were published in <i>The Expenditure Report 2013</i> which is available on my Department's website (www.per.gov.ie).  Table 3a shows the forecast outturn for net voted capital estimates in 2012 as &#8364;3.5 billion.  It also shows a revised 2012 Estimate for net capital expenditure (reduced from &#8364;3.6 billion to &#8364;3.5 billion) reflecting changes to the capital ceilings following a number of Supplementary Estimates in December.</p><p>  The forecast outturn, as published in <i>The Expenditure Report</i>, includes carryover of unspent capital into 2013 of &#8364;107 million.  As the Deputy will be aware, the capital carryover facility was introduced as part of the rolling multi-annual capital envelope system in order to allow Departments to manage their capital budgets more effectively.</p><p>  It is important to note that the forecast outturn figures as published in <i>The Expenditure Report</i> are Departments' best estimate, as of end November, of what their final net capital spend will be at year end.  Actual figures for capital expenditure by Departments in 2012 will be available in early 2013. </p><p>  Any underspend in the capital budget will be returned, as a saving, to the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The aim of the Action Pan for Jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible go to those who are currently unemployed.  The Government&rsquo;s approach is a national one across all regions and there are no plans to set up Regional Task Forces.</p><p>  The Action Plan contains over 270 individual actions to be delivered in 2012, spanning all Government Departments and 36 State agencies.  The 270 actions are broken down further into Quarterly deliverables or &ldquo;measures&rdquo; which are reported on at the end of each Quarter.  Approximately 60% of the measures in the Action Plan for Jobs are for delivery by my Department or its agencies.  To the end of the third Quarter this year, around 130 measures had been implemented by my Department and its agencies, giving a delivery rate of approximately 97%.  </p><p>  Some significant objectives have been realised, including the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small business, the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme, new supports for first time exporters, the launch of a new Women-In-Business Programme, the simplification and extension of the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption Scheme, the launch of a National Broadband Plan, the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub, and work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, and the Green Economy.</p><p>  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 9,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  In the first eight months of this year, a total of 7,094 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured. </p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s plans for jobs and growth.  On 21 November, I announced that primary legislation will be drafted to dissolve the existing County and City Enterprise Boards and create an enhanced national micro enterprise support model, delivered through Local Enterprise Offices to be established in each Local Authority office.  </p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placements and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Pathways to Work initiative has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.</p><p>  We will continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, and in that context, will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.</p></reply>

I repeated this assurance personally to the person concerned when I met him and a delegation from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and SIPTU.</p><p>  The Deputy will note that the Government did not oppose Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill as it concurs with our objectives - to ensure that outcome of the High Court case will not arise again. </p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgement is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions.  My Department has received preliminary legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General counselling that the judgement raises matters that are particularly complex.  These matters are currently receiving priority attention with a view to identifying the best way in which the legislation may be amended. </p><p>  It is my firm intention to amend the Employment Permits legislation in a precise manner so as to ensure that an employer may not benefit from the illegality of the contract of employment where they are found culpable in not ensuring a valid employment permit was in place for the employee concerned.  To this end, I hope to be in a position to propose the necessary provisions in a new Employment Permits Bill, currently being drafted and which is anticipated to be introduced in the first quarter of next year.  I believe that this would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter.  Decisions on the legal options will be made in light of further legal advice and in consultation with other Government departments.  I can assure the Deputy that my Bill is a Government priority and I would expect a speedy passage through the Oireachtas after its introduction.</p><p>  Finally, I wish to stress that the judgement relates only to the consideration of the enforceability, or otherwise, of an employee&rsquo;s rights.  It does not mean that unscrupulous employers can employ unauthorised third country nationals without running the risk of significant legal consequences.  I would emphasise that an employer who engages in this type of activity is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation and could be found guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.  Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Employment Rights Authority actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.</p></reply>

The Certification confirms that new building products, materials, techniques and equipment are safe and fit for purpose at the time of installation. </p><p>  The NSAI have advised that Condition 5.1(c) of the Certificate relates to the assessment of the manufacturing processes and marking of the product in general.  The manufacturing process is under continual assessment, as long as the Certificate and certification agreement remains in place; this ensures consistency of production with the conditions of the Certificate issued.  The Clause does not infer that a specific unit &ldquo;continues to be assessed&rdquo; for its lifetime.  </p><p>  Part 4 Section 4.4 is a general statement about the expected lifespan of a product.  It is not an absolute guarantee that all units will last 30 years; it is merely an opinion that if installed, maintained and operated correctly then the expected lifespan should be in the order of 30 years.  This does not rule out the possibility that some units may malfunction in a lesser amount of time.  Part 4 Section 4.4 must be read in conjunction with the remainder of the Certificate, in particular, Conditions 5.1 to 5.7. </p><p>  I understand that the ongoing monitoring of the installed unit&rsquo;s performance is the responsibility of the homeowner who is obliged to register the unit with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  NSAI&rsquo;s monitoring of the manufacturing processes ceases with the termination/withdrawal of the Certificate. </p><p>  In terms of a remedy available to those who purchased and installed the units, it is not clear if the remedies available under Consumer Protection legislation apply to the particular circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  The protections outlined below, only apply to persons when acting as consumers i.e. acting for purposes unrelated to the person&rsquo;s trade, business or profession.</p><p>  Consumers who believe that goods which they purchased may not have been of merchantable quality or that suppliers who provided them with services did not have the necessary skills or did not provide such services with due skill, care and attention, as required by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, may wish to consult their legal advisors in relation to enforcing their rights under that Act.</p><p>  Consumers also enjoy protections under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 which prohibits traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices where such practices would be likely to cause an appreciable impairment of the average consumer's ability to make an informed choice in relation to products offered for sale and which would also cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that the average consumer would not otherwise make.  The Act also prohibits traders from engaging in misleading commercial practices and/or prescribed prohibited practices as defined by the legislation.  Consumers who believe that traders may be engaging in unfair, misleading or prohibited commercial practices may wish to bring evidence of such practices to the attention of the National Consumer Agency so that it may be investigated.</p></reply>

The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels that are in receipt of one of the following claims (Jobseekers Allowance/Jobseekers Benefit/One Parent Family Payment/Disability Allowance) or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months (78 Days).</p><p>  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  Furthermore, the Scheme is open to organisations or self-employed individuals in all sectors including private, public, voluntary and community sectors provided they have a minimum of 1 full time employee (employed for 30 hours or more per week, subject to tax and PRSI).</p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. Over 12,800 internships have commenced to date with 5,578 participants currently on an internship as at 6<sup>th</sup> December 2012 and over 2,100 internship opportunities presently advertised on<i></i><i></i>  . An independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon found that 52% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment on completion of their internship placements. This represents very significant progress and very strong progression rates into employment.</p><p>  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the ongoing formal evaluation of JobBridge.  It is anticipated that the final Report will be available in late December.  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, it will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market, analysis of age categories and further findings concerning progression into employment. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved. It is at this stage that further consideration will be given to amending the terms and conditions of the Scheme</p></reply>

However, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits.  Class S contributions provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) only.  </p><p>  In terms of current supports available to self-employed persons, in certain cases, a self-employed person who had insurable employment in the relevant year and had paid sufficient Class A contributions may qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, provided all the conditions of the scheme are satisfied.</p><p>  A self-employed person who has paid insufficient Class A contributions may instead qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a means-tested payment and in assessing a person&rsquo;s means for the purposes of this allowance, account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  In general, this means assessment will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate, account is taken of the economic situation and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years.  The process also recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next. </p><p>  It should also be noted that EU/EEA regulations provide that periods of social insurance in one Member State may be credited to a worker's social insurance record in another Member State to facilitate qualification for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit. In this regard, the person must have been covered by a period of social insurance in the other country and the person must have paid at least one reckonable contribution since the date they last arrived in Ireland.</p></reply>

His average earnings were calculated having regard to his earnings in the year ended 31 December 2011, the latest available P60.  His most recent payslips were also examined but these gave him a higher weekly net income than his P60. The income from his P60 was used in his FIS assessment as this gave a more representative view of his net income over a longer period of time resulting in him qualifying for a more favourable rate of FIS.   Based on his P60, the net weekly income of the person concerned was assessed at &euro;256, which for a family with two children qualifies him for a weekly FIS rate of &euro;208.00 for 52 weeks from 30th August 2012 to 28th   August 2012.  </p><p>  From the information submitted with your question, it appears that the income of the person concerned changed again from October 2012. However as his entitlement to FIS is determined from 30th   of August 2012 for 52 weeks, income changes from October 2012 will not be taken into account until his renewal application in August 2013. </p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born during the 52 week period. </p><p>  On the other hand, the rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings. A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.   This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment </p></reply>

Property for this purpose includes: i. Money invested in a bank, building society or other financial institution; ii. The current market value of stocks and shares of every description, and iii. Houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use (including property which is rented out). </p><p>  However, it does not include property such as the home or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>  For assessment purposes, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a formula. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made.  Accordingly, it is the value of the outstanding mortgage which is taken into account as distinct from the interest payments on that mortgage.</p><p>  In establishing the current market value of a property, the Department may make enquiry of the State Valuation Office. Alternatively, the market value may be established through receipt of a reasonable current valuation from a registered auctioneer, with reference to the purchase price and date of purchase of the property or, alternatively, the inspector may agree a valuation with a customer having regard to the type and location of the individual property and prevailing market values in that area. </p><p>  The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors</p><p>  Its aim is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience and provide the opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills in a working environment</p><p>  The JobBridge Scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2011. Over 12,800 internships have commenced to date with 5,578 participants currently on an internship as at 6<sup>th</sup> December 2012 and over 2,100 internship opportunities presently advertised on <i></i>. An independent evaluation of the Scheme conducted by Indecon found that 52% of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment on completion of their internship placements. This represents very significant progress and very strong progression rates into employment.</p><p>  In response to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, I wish to advise an email complaint in respect of this matter was sent by UNITE trade union on 27<sup>th</sup> November at 20:49 to the JobBridge Central Unit. This matter was fully investigated on 28<sup>th</sup> November and a response was issued by the JobBridge Central Unit on 29<sup>th</sup> November at 09:23. This matter was also raised by Deputy Joe Higgins as a Topical Debate Motion on 29<sup>th</sup> November though it was not ultimately selected for answer; a response was accordingly then issued to the Deputy on 30<sup>th</sup>   November at 16:18 in respect of this matter.  </p><p>  The complaint alleged that Chartered Accounts Ireland was using JobBridge to displace employees. It was alleged that these incidences of displacement took effect from August 2012. As highlighted above, this complaint was treated very seriously by my Departments&#8217; officials and investigated immediately. </p><p>  The investigation of this complaint found that Chartered Accountants Ireland had only advertised one internship opportunity on the JobBridge website since August 2012. This internship position, reference: 710310 was for a Marketing Executive.   The advert went live on the JobBridge website on 21<sup>st</sup>   August 2012. Our records indicate that nobody has been selected by the company to start this internship. This was communicated via email to an official of UNITE and Deputy Joe Higgins, in the respective email responses from the JobBridge Central Unit. UNITE was invited to contact the JobBridge unit in the event of any further queries or concerns in this regard and that staff in the unit would assist further.  My Department has not to date received a response to the email correspondence sent to UNITE and Deputy Higgins on this matter. </p><p>  Furthermore, UNITE and the Deputy were also advised that Chartered Accountants Ireland submitted an additional five internship vacancies but these were rejected by the JobBridge team as they did not meet the Scheme&#8217;s quality criteria. </p><p>  The terms and conditions for participation in JobBridge are stringent to ensure that strong systems and controls are in place.  </p><p>  In order to protect the Intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme a variety of control measures and criteria have been introduced. These ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.  </p><p>  Firstly, the Standard Agreement signed and agreed to by both the Intern and the host organisation upon commencement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30 &#8211; 40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.</p><p>  Secondly, to ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection are involved in the on-going monitoring of internships. This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship. I am delighted to advise that 97% of monitoring visits conducted to-date were of a satisfactory nature. Remedial action has been taken in cases where the visit was deemed not to be of a satisfactory nature</p><p>  Consequently, it is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their internship for advice and support</p></reply>

In tandem many large employers currently have significant numbers of part time workers who are also being paid by the Department.  In acknowledgement of this trend, the Department has commenced work on the consideration of the future structure of the jobseeker schemes.  In this regard my Department&#8217;s work is being informed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education report, <i>A Review of the Status of Casual Workers in Ireland.  </i>  This report recommended increasing the flexibility of the existing jobseeker schemes by moving from the current days based system to a system of entitlement based on hours. However, increasing flexibility in the system could potentially, depending on the behavioural response, increase the number of people claiming a jobseeker&#8217;s payment thereby increasing the total cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. </p><p>  This work is complex and is taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms including the recognition of Sunday working for jobseekers, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative change that implementation of reform to the jobseeker&#8217;s schemes will require.</p></reply>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p><p>  FIS claims, both new and renewal, received on or after the 5th November 2012 are currently being processed on receipt.  There are currently 293 new applications and 94 renewal applications waiting for more than 6 months.  In addition to delays caused by the current backlog of claims awaiting processing, factors that can delay FIS applications are the provision of information and documentation by applicants and their employers as well as cases which require information from other EU countries or where referral to the social welfare inspectorate is required.</p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output, improving customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity is needed in order to process the volumes of claims, both new and renewal, being received on a weekly basis.</p><p>  The outcome of this review is a detailed plan outlining the process required to manage both the continuous weekly intake and backlog claims clearance.  This plan sees the current weekly new claim and renewal intake processed by one team, while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.  </p><p>  This team including additional temporary resources has been identified and is already assigned and working on the backlog claims.  In order to reduce the time it will take to eliminate the backlog, some claims are being processed outside of Longford Social Welfare Services Office.  This team is fully focussed on the elimination of the backlog of claims in the shortest possible timeframe, concentrating in the first instance on those claims which were previously in payment but where payment has expired and continuing on to first-time new claims.  Within those categories, those waiting the longest will be processed first.  </p><p>  It is expected that the backlog will be fully eliminated by the end of March 2013.  Claims which are approved by the backlog team will be backdated to the date of claim or the date of expiry of the previous claim, as appropriate, and all arrears due will be paid.</p></reply>

If a claimant is still unemployed when they exhaust their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, they may claim Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance which is subject to a means test. People transferring to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance immediately after finishing their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit may receive the maximum weekly payment rate of &euro;188 rather than the reduced rate of &euro;144 or &euro;100 which is paid to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients aged between 18 and 21 or 22 to 24 respectively.</p><p>  Current legislation provides that where a person aged 25 years or under claims Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home, an assessment is made of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing there. The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents' assessable income.</p><p>  There are two exceptions to this rule.  No assessment is made where a son or daughter  and his or her spouse / civil partner / partner is living with his / her parents or where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least three years.  Parental income includes income from employment, self-employment, pensions, rental income, maintenance payments and some social welfare payments and health service executive payments.  </p><p>  All income must be declared. However, deductions are allowed for income tax, universal social charge, PRSI, superannuation/ PRSA contributions, private health insurance contribution, pension levy and union dues.  Deductions are also allowed for rent or mortgage payments and a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;30 per week in respect of other dependent children applies.  Any balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege. </p><p>  Once the person concerned reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege will no longer be regarded as means.</p></reply>

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  The recent Budget announcement has no impact on the level of statutory redundancy payable to employees who are being made redundant.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is currently entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</p><p>  Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decisions to revise the rebate rate last year and now to remove the rebate was the increasing cost of rebates in recent years.  I am very concerned about the deficit in the SIF.  In terms of redundancy rebate payments to employers, &euro;152.2 million was paid out in 2006; &euro;167.4 million in 2007; &euro;161.8 million in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;185.3 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.</p><p>  As a result of the changes announced in Budget 2013 no rebate will be payable to employers in cases where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy occurs on or after 1 January 2013.  The 15% rebate will continue to apply to those cases on hand and those which will be received in the coming months where the date of dismissal is on or between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012.  It is not proposed to make exceptions to the abolition of the redundancy rebate for small businesses.</p></reply>

Indeed, in the context of reduced resources and the current economic climate, the key challenge is to prioritise and reduce the cost of service delivery, without compromising on the delivery of services to the public and to employees.</p><p>  To date, my Department has moved its entire payroll and payment processing function to the Killarney Shared Service.  My Department is also currently availing of ICT shared services from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and shares other infrastructural and accommodation services and costs with a number of public bodies.  It might be noted that my Department also currently provides a HR service to a number of the bodies funded from the Department&rsquo;s Vote Group and is examining options around expanding this service.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department also has been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently in relation to the conducting of VFM reviews.  In this regard, I understand that the process of carrying out such reviews, including through shared services and on an external service basis, is currently being examined centrally.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that certain services such as cleaning services are provided by external service providers, while in other areas, such as property and facility management, we largely avail of services from the Office of Public Works.  It should be noted that my Department has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife portfolio and in this regard, my Department manages and operates a number of tourism and visitor sites across the country.  We are currently reviewing the business processes and services provided at those sites and examining options around external service delivery.  The overall objective will of course be to continue delivering a quality service to our customers at these sites.</p><p>  It might also be noted that across the heritage services for which this Department is responsible, the Department already outsources and uses external service providers for technical advice, engineering services and some architectural services and this has proved very cost effective.  In the context of the staffing gaps and expertise gaps arising in the Department in recent times, including the need to refocus and prioritise work, we are examining further options and possible alternative delivery mechanisms in order to achieve cost savings and to have prompt access as required to specific technical skills.  This will also enable us to focus on core valued-added activities.</p><p>  One of the key sectoral reforms for my Department as outlined in its High-Level Reform Plan, is the delivery of an electronic Property Management System, which will record all properties and land in the ownership and care of the Department.  A new unit within the National Parks and Wildlife Division of the Department has been established to progress this project, including the examination of options around outsourcing and delivering elements of the project through an external service provider, with the required technical expertise.</p></reply>

Another (appointed by me as Minster for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources) is an electrical engineering expert.

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.</p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30 Mbps and 40 Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan contains a commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Carbury, County Kildare, will have at least 30 Mbps connectivity.</p><p>I would also suggest that the person in question keeps in touch with broadband service providers in the County Kildare area to ascertain what services and speeds are on offer.  The Communications Regulator, ComReg, has details on its website,  as to services providers in each county.</p></reply>

I understand there were 85 TEPs established throughout the EU.   </p><p>  The Commission view was that Employment Pacts should encourage widespread regional or local partnership in high unemployment areas. At that time, Ireland had already put in place the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development (OPLURD) at local and district level, which encompassed much of what TEPs intended to address. Accordingly, four Irish TEPs were established, each with a different type of regional focus. In 2001, responsibility for the Employment Pacts was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and mainstreamed within the Local Development Social Inclusion Measure of the S&amp;E and BMW Regional Operational Programmes of the National Development Plan, administered through Pobal.   </p><p>  I have no plans to establish Territorial Employment Pacts based on the NUTS 3 Regions. My Department currently operates the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), launched in January 2010 as a successor to two previous programmes &#8211; the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme. The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. It is a key tool of Government in providing supports, including employment supports, to the &#8216;harder to reach&#8217; in the most disadvantaged areas of the country.   </p><p>  In terms of future approaches, the Government is committed, following the adoption in October 2012 of <i>Putting People First: Action Programme for Effective</i><i>Local Government</i>  , to bringing greater alignment between local and community development and local government. </p></reply>

The activities of companies operating with an IPPC licence are monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that the terms of their licences are respected, including in relation to emissions.    </p><p>  In addition to the requirements of IPPC, the provisions of the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) 2001/80/EC also apply to combustion plants with a thermal output of 50MW or more.<b></b>The LCPD aims to reduce acidification, ground-level ozone and particles by controlling emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>  ) and particulate matter (PM) from power stations running on solid, liquid or gaseous fuel. </p><p>  Ireland developed a national emissions reduction plan (NERP) under Article 4 (6) of the 2001 LCPD, which is a mechanism that allows &#8220;existing plant&#8221;, as defined in the Directive, to achieve the environmental objectives of the Directive in a cost-effective manner through the installation of abatement at selected qualifying plants. The NERP option was chosen because it provided both an environmentally ambitious and a cost-effective compliance route for Ireland. The ESB and other national operators made a commitment to achieve emission limits for SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> from existing plants that were significantly more ambitious than the minimum requirements of the LCPD. In the period from 2008 to 2016, emission reductions are 27% more ambitious for SO<sub>2</sub> and 46% more ambitious for NO<sub>x </sub>  emissions. </p><p>  The EEA study referenced in the question did not assess whether the emissions of a given facility are consistent with its legal requirements.  There has been no breach of IPPC licensing conditions by ESB or other power plants. Monitoring undertaken by the EPA has shown that total emissions from such plants are consistently below the levels prescribed to ensure adequate protection of human health and the environment.   </p><p>  The LCPD has now been recast by the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU, in respect of which my Department is currently preparing Regulations to achieve transposition into national legislation. As part of the transposition process, my Department is assessing appropriate compliance options for older plants set out under the Directive to ensure that operators continue to commit to ambitious targets that strike the appropriate balance between protection of human health and the environment and cost effectiveness of the abatement solutions. </p></reply>

Shared services have been identified in the Local Government Efficiency Review and the Public Service Reform Plan as an important opportunity to make further savings in administrative costs without impacting on front line services. </p><p>  To drive the reform agenda, and in particular shared service initiatives, in the local government sector a dedicated Programme Management Office (PMO) has been established, which reports to a high level oversight group. The PMO has been staffed and resourced drawing from existing expertise and resources in the sector. Experienced staff from a number of authorities, with a range of appropriate skills, have been seconded to the PMO.  In order to support the Department and the PMO further in our work on shared services a shared services advisor has been recruited through open competition by the Public Appointments Service. </p><p>  Overall, thirty one operational areas are being examined for potential as a shared service or other collaborative approach that may provide efficiencies. Prioritised areas for consideration in the shared services programme include Treasury Management, Payroll, Transactional HR, ICT, Housing Assessment, Application and Allocation, Accounts Payable, Debt Collection, Legal Services   and Procurement. </p><p>  The PMO has adopted a comprehensive methodology for the development and evaluation of projects including peer review of business cases. In relation to each area under consideration a standard project initiation document has been prepared. At this point, business cases have been prepared for a number of business areas including Payroll, Treasury Management, ICT, Legal Services and Housing. The Payroll, Treasury Management and Legal Services business cases have undergone peer review. The business case for ICT is complete and the case for Transactional HR is nearing completion. It is expected that both business cases will undergo peer review before year end. </p><p>  The process in respect of a joint approach to procurement is at a more advanced stage and Kerry County Council is now the lead in the Local Authority National Procurement Office. </p><p>  Outside the shared services programme local authorities continue to pursue delivery of efficient services on a shared and collaborative basis. In this regard, recent initiatives include Dublin City Council managing controls on a national basis for the movement of hazardous waste, and Offaly County Council acting as the lead local authority in respect of waste collection permitting. </p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector. Real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates and the Committee is meeting on a regular basis to oversee this effort.   </p><p>  Site Resolution Plans (SRP&#8217;s) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership. Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents. The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at<i></i><i></i></p><p>  My Department launched the Public Safety Initiative in March 2011, which provided funding to address immediate public safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date under the PSI include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. Under the PSI, my Department has made allocations totalling some &#8364;3.75 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available. A provision of &#8364;2m was made for 2012 and to date, a total of &#8364;2.3 million has been drawn down by local authorities. </p><p>  As outlined in the National Housing Development Survey 2012, the results of which I published in November, real progress has been made in tackling the issues faced by the residents of unfinished housing developments, with a 37% decrease in the number of unfinished developments since 2010 and nearly 300 developments effectively resolved in the last 12 months. I am satisfied that the work carried out through the NCC continues to tackle the problems associated with unfinished housing developments.   </p></reply>

An objective in reviewing electoral areas is to achieve a better balance and consistency in representation ratios and, logically, there is a strong case for reducing the degree of representational imbalance currently in the Dublin authorities.  The terms of reference for Committee specify , therefore, that the number of members in Dublin City Council shall be fixed at 63 and in every other council, other than Cork County Council, shall be subject to a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 40 members.       </p><p>In this context, I am conscious that any decrease in the population to member ratio as a result of rebalancing of representation, will have implications for the size of some councils and the associated efficiency and cost.  Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the substantial reduction in council seats country wide together with the implementation of changes to structures, functions and funding and the pursuit of operational and organisational efficiency measures , including a revised financial support framework for councillors, will result in a local government system that delivers a wide range of functions and services more efficiently and effectively.   </p><p>In relation to the cost of additional council seats, the <i>Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i><i>-</i><i>Putting People First</i> proposes that the structures for, and levels of, all payments to councillors will be reviewed, while having regard to the reformed sub-county structure and regional governance and the need to ensure sufficient incentive for high-quality representation of the community.  Currently it is estimated that payments to councillors in the Dublin local authorities amount to approximately &#8364;26,000 per annum. </p></reply>

The brutal nature of these crimes is a stark reminder to us of the mentality of those involved in organised criminality and the danger which they pose to our society.</p><p>  I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspects of serious crime and the Garda&iacute; will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved in gangland crime.  The only effective way to combat organised crime is by disrupting and prosecuting those involved in its operations, and especially the drugs trade which is at the heart of much of its profits.  There have been extensive Garda operations launched against gangs as well as significant drug seizures in recent months and weeks with drugs seizures estimated at &euro;90.4m for the first nine months of this year.</p><p>  We shouldn't underestimate the difficulties the Garda&iacute; face in trying to prevent gangland killings and related crimes and in bringing the perpetrators to justice.  These crimes are carefully planned and are carried out by people who are very familiar with criminal and forensic investigation techniques.  Moreover, despite the clear risk to themselves, members of gangs will not generally cooperate with Garda investigations.</p><p>  It would be wrong to characterise this as a budgetary matter.  There has been gangland violence for some time in Ireland, and the number of murders was in fact higher when Garda numbers were higher than they are now.  It is also unrealistic to expect that the Commissioner would devote his entire resources, to individually protecting people who are routinely trying to avoid the Garda&iacute; so that they can continue to engage in criminal activity.  Such an approach could only come at the expense of ordinary Garda activity to protect the community generally.  We should also remember that week in week out the Garda&iacute; are successfully bringing people involved in gangland activities before the Courts, securing convictions and that a substantial number are presently serving their sentences in prison.</p><p>  There is already very strong anti-gangland legislation in place.  As Minister I will continue to pursue important improvements to our overall legislative architecture.  In this regard, the legislative priority for combating crime is the publication and enactment of a new Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill.  This Bill represents a major step forward in the fight against serious crime.  It will lead to the establishment, for the first time, of a national DNA database in Ireland.  It will give the Garda&iacute; access to intelligence on a scale and of a quality that was not previously been available in this country.</p><p>  Finally I have made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that, if he feels there are other measures which might be taken in this area, then I will look at that very positively.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the financial reports of registered charities to be made publicly available. However, these provisions are contingent on the establishment of a new Charities Regulatory Authority and a statutory register of charities as also provided for under the Act. Due to the anticipated costs of these measures, the further implementation of the Act had to be deferred. I intend to consult publicly in the near future on cost-effective options for bringing the provisions of the Act into force.</p><p>  There is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities. Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies. The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law. A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie. Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide financial information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts. This information can then be accessed by the public. Such charities would also potentially be subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law. And, of course, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.  Finally, it is of course open to charities themselves to make such information available in line with existing legislative provisions.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.  Under Section 7(3) of the Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the Legal Aid Board is or may be concerned.  The Deputy might further wish to note that the solicitor/client relationship is protected by privilege in accordance with the terms of Section 32 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and therefore the Board does not provide information to third parties regarding a person who may or may not be a client of the Board.</p><p>  However, I am informed that the Legal Aid Board provides a priority service in cases where it considers that an immediate, or near immediate, service was needed. These include cases of domestic violence, child abduction, cases involving applications by the State to take children into care, and cases that have statutory time limits close to expiry.  Finally, while I can advise the Deputy that a person who is refused legal aid has the right to appeal this decision to an Appeal Committee which is made up of non-executive members of the Board, again I have no role in this process.</p></reply>

However, the recently published Irish Prison Service 3-Year Strategic Plan contains a commitment to implement a 40 month capital plan to provide in-cell sanitation in all cells and radically improve prison conditions in the older parts of the prison estate.  The provision of a gross budget of &euro;333.8 million for the Prisons Vote includes a capital allocation of &euro;24 million which will allow construction work on the much needed new prison in Cork to commence in 2013, as well as other essential refurbishment and construction works in Mountjoy and Limerick Prisons.</p><p>  The Prison Service is continuing with a refurbishment and in-cell sanitation project in Mountjoy Prison. The Refurbishment of the C and B wings have been completed resulting in 317 cells in the prison having in-cell sanitation (almost 60% of the total prison) and a significantly improved physical environment. A tender for the refurbishment of the prison's A wing is currently under evaluation and a contract is expected to be placed before the end of this year. The project will take 9 months to complete. The Prison Service is developing its plans for the modernisation of the D wing together with a range of supporting facilities for the prison such as workshops, kitchens laundry etc. It is expected that this final phase in the renewal of Mountjoy prison will go to tender in July 2013 and that the entire programme will be completed in April 2015.</p><p>  The new facility in Cork will be built on a site immediately adjacent to the existing prison and will house 275 prisoners and have a maximum capacity of  310 prisoners.  Planning and design are at an advanced stage and it is expected that, subject to planning permission, the project will go to tender in February 2013 with construction works commencing in August 2013.  Construction of the new prison will take approximately 2 years and, allowing for commissioning of systems etc.,  it is expected that the new prison will be operational by September 2015.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service is preparing plans for the demolition of the early 19th century A and B wings of Limerick Prison and their replacement with modern cellular accommodation on a site adjacent to the prison. The new development  will include full in-cell sanitation, showers and a range of ancillary facilities. Following the necessary approval, planning and tender processes, it is hoped that construction will commence in August/September  2013 with completion/commissioning in June/July early 2015.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice &amp; Equality is responsible for a broad range of public administration concerns, many of which go to the heart of what is vital in a democratic society, and, as such, are not always suitable for external service delivery.

I would expect to see significant dividends from this initiative in the coming months.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and have been informed that the Courts Service has been reviewing all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that the Service can continue to maintain the delivery of front line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users.  I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review and that Kells District Court has been identified as a venue to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case.</p><p>  In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue which has now commenced.  However, the Courts Service has assured me that no decision in relation to the future of Kells District Court will be taken without prior consultation with local interested parties and court users.  This consultation will commence shortly and the views received will be taken into account in the decision making process which will be a matter for the Courts Service Board.</p></reply>

The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process. Chapter 5 sets out four broad approaches to legislative policy on prostitution, for discussion.  On its publication, the discussion document was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and will report back to me when it has completed its work. </p><p>  In addition, my Department hosted a conference in October to discuss the consultation paper. </p><p>  The report of the joint committee and the views expressed at the conference will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that until the consultation process and review are completed, it would not be proper to commit to any particular legislative approach.  There are differing and genuinely held views on the appropriate legislative response to prostitution.  The consultation process must be and be seen to be objective, transparent, open-minded and fair.   For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document.</p><p>  Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution</p><p>  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution. Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:</p><p>  &quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.</p><p>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;</p><p>  The Minister added that:   &quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.</p><p>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.   </p><p>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.   </p><p>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;   </p><p>  The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website, <i> </i></p><p>  This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection. The arguments contained in the document are not exhaustive and the questions posed are not intended to limit in any way the range of questions readers might want to consider.  </p><p>22 June, 2012  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p><p> These changes to the delivery of policing services provide for effectiveness and efficiencies through a programme of restructuring and reconfiguration of service delivery methods. They are supported by changes to work practices within the new rostering arrangements which were introduced on a pilot basis last April.</p><p>  The new Garda roster is designed to better match the availability of Garda&iacute; with policing demands at national and local level, while also safeguarding the welfare of members.

In some instances, prisoners are transferred to other establishments. </p><p>  Given the number of prisoners in custody it is not possible to segregate those who are in prison for the first time from those who have been in custody on more than one occasion. It must be borne in mind that a persons first period of imprisonment does not necessarily indicate a first offence.</p><p>  Efforts are made, where possible to segregate remand prisoners from sentenced prisoners. In addition, prisoners who are vulnerable or have requested the protection of the Governor are segregated from the general prison population. Every effort is made to ensure that those prisoners who cannot associate freely with the general prison population have the greatest possible access to services.</p><p>  The statistics requested by the Deputy are not centrally recorded by the Irish Prison Service and to provide such information would require the allocation of a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and resources.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that the Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.   On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.</p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>  An average of 38% of the prison population attended educational classes in 2011.  The development of vocational training programmes in recent years means that there are now over 100 workshops capable of catering for in excess of 1,000 prisoners each day.  Returns at the end of November 2012 show that approximately 24% of the prison population were engaged in vocational training programmes. There was also a significant increase in the number of prisoners who participated in accredited vocational training course in 2011, when 1219 prisoners attended such courses.  </p></reply>

While incidents of serious and violent crime continue to be committed and have a substantial impact on victims and their families, it is important to note that the most recent recorded crime statistics, which are for the 12 month period to the end of June 2012, show that most categories of crime are in fact falling.  This reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the figures show that murder had decreased by 8% and assault offences were down by 9.7%.  Public order and damage to property offences were also down (by 13.1% and 10.8% respectively).</p><p>  Notwithstanding the positive messages from the latest crime figures, it remains imperative that we confront and disrupt violent criminals and the Garda&iacute; have the full support of the Government in this.  I am advised that Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  There is already a range of strong legislation in place to counter the sorts of crime referred to by the Deputy and I have also made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that if he feels there are other measures which might usefully be taken I will look at that very positively. </p></reply>

In this context the Garda authorities have indicated that significant resources have been, and will continue to be, devoted to tackling organised crime.  </p><p>  As the  Deputy will be aware the Garda&iacute; are bearing down very hard on criminal gangs.  Week in week out, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making arrests and bringing persons before the courts, with substantial sentences being imposed in many cases.  Considerable success has also been achieved in disrupting the illicit drugs trade on which much organised crime depends.  In excess of &euro;90m of drugs were seized in the first nine months of the year, including the largest inland seizure of cocaine in Ireland.  Other seizures are taking place on a continuous basis.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recent years considerable progress has been made within the Force in the deployment of modern technological support in the fight against organised crime.  These advances include the full roll out of the National Digital Radio System, the Automated Fingerprint Information System and Automated Number Plate Recognition.</p><p>  With regard to transport, the Deputy will be aware that a recent investment of &euro;3 million in the Garda fleet has resulted in an order for 170 new vehicles being placed this year. These vehicles are due to begin coming on stream in the coming weeks.  This investment brings to more than 210 the number of new vehicles ordered this year, at a cost of &euro;4 million.  In addition, a further &euro;5 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  </p><p>  This level of expenditure, at a time of severe budgetary constraint, represents a very significant investment in Garda transport.  I have no doubt that the additional funding, in conjunction with the advanced policing technologies available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will contribute to the effectiveness of the force in preventing and detecting organised crime.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces have participated in UNTSO since 1958.  Defence Forces personnel serving with this mission are based in Syria, Israel and Lebanon.  The main functions of UNTSO are to maintain regional dialogue, monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements and to assist UN peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Syria.  The six UNTSO Defence Forces personnel based in Syria are part of Observer Group Golan responsible for the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.  One Irish officer is the Chief of Observer Group Golan and has responsibility for the conduct of operations by UN Military Observers within Israeli Occupied Golan and Syria.  The remaining five Defence Forces personnel are deployed as UN Military Observers and conduct their duties in support of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.  Their duties include manning Observation Posts, conducting fortnightly inspections of the deployment of Syrian Arab Armed Forces and conducting patrols within the Area of Limitation in order to ensure that no activities occur which could lead to the breach of the ceasefire between Israel and Syria.</p><p>  As the security situation in Syria remains highly volatile, Defence Forces personnel normally based in Damascus were relocated by UNTSO to offices and accommodation at UNDOF Headquarters in the Golan Heights, on 15 October 2012, as a temporary force protection measure.  The Irish personnel continue to fulfill their roles from this temporary location.  It is intended that they will return to offices and accommodation in Damascus should there be an improvement in the security situation.</p><p>  Six members of the Permanent Defence Force who had been deployed as unarmed military observers to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) were withdrawn in August 2012 when the mission&#8217;s mandate came to an end.</p></reply>

These can be brought forward through a variety of means such as Codes of Practice, Regulations or other primary legislation, which can lay down more detailed laws for specific animals in certain cases, such as the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, which was brought forward by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and local Government.  That Act sets out detailed rules applying to premises at which bitches are kept, &ldquo;not less than 6 of which are more than 6 months old, and capable of being used for breeding purposes&rdquo;.  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 empowers local authorities to appoint &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; for the enforcement of the requirements of that Act.</p><p>  Separately, under EU Regulations in respect of animal transport, my Department has put in place guidelines for the welfare of non-farming animals (&ldquo;other species&rdquo;) during commercial transport. </p></reply>

These include, inter alia, the possible impact on the timber industry, implications for the company and levels of employment, environmental and social impacts, and public access to recreational land and the protection of the recreational amenities. These issues, and the measures, if necessary, to address them, require detailed consideration. </p><p>  I am aware that Coillte&rsquo;s forests provide a range of recreational opportunities for the general public continuing a long tradition of open access to state owned forests. I am also conscious that such recreational facilities are very valuable resources as tourism attractions in the various regions.  In view of the importance of such recreational opportunities for citizens for ongoing recreation and for visitors during their stay in Ireland the issue of public access to recreational land forms part of the overall analysis. </p></reply>

The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority confirmed on 4 December last that this vessel, based on pairing arrangements, did land the required amount in the first management period and so the vessel was included in the second management period.  A quota notification for this vessel issued on 4 December 2012.  In relation to the requirement to land 50% of the first period allocation to qualify for the second fishing period, I received a large number of appeals due to a variety of reasons such as bad weather, mechanical breakdown and size.  A number of small inshore vessels had advised that they were unable to participate due to their size, weather conditions and the location of the stock.  In view of this, I have decided to vary the management arrangements to remove the 50% landing requirement.  In order to implement an effect management regime for the remainder of the fishery, I decided that any vessel which has booked in shall receive an allocation for a two-week period from 00:01 on 9 December 2012 to 00.01 on 21 December 2012.</p></reply>

I understand that vessel in question<font color="#004080"> </font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   </p><p>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.</p><p>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.</p><p>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  </p><p>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. </i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    </p><p>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.</p><p>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.</p><p>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  </p><p>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  </p><p>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.</p></reply>

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  </p><p>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  </i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    </p><p>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.</p></reply>

These powers include the making of bye-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the local authorities&rsquo; functional area, together with provisions on licensing of horses within control areas and seizure and detention of stray or abandoned horses.  My officials are in ongoing contact with Local Authority representatives to underline that  effective implementation of Control of Horses Act by them can assist with controlling horses and reducing potential horse welfare problems developing, particularly with regard to horses that are straying and or abandoned.</p><p>  My Department also provides financial assistance to Local Authorities to assist in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act. To date this year, almost &euro;2m has been provided for this purpose.</p><p>  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill which I am bringing forward consolidates a wide range of existing legislation.  As such, it will apply in a wide range of situations affecting the welfare of animals and will be enforceable by a range of state bodies such as An Garda, customs officers and local authorities. The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill sets out general horizontal rules on health and welfare that will apply to all animals.  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill does not set out detailed rules for individual species or sectors. These can be dealt with through a variety of means such as Codes Of Practice, Regulations or other primary legislation which can lay down more detailed laws for different species in certain cases such as, for example, The Control of Horses Act. This Act already contains provisions enabling the local authorities to stable horses prior to determining their status. I should add that all owners or persons in charge of premises where horses are kept are required to register these premises under the Diseases of Animals (Registration of Equine Premises) Order 2012 (SI No 8 of 2012).</p></reply>

The new arrangements for contiguous testing provide that herds which are contiguous to a high risk TB breakdown and which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be trade restricted pending a full herd test.  Such herds will be immediately de-restricted once they pass a TB herd test. </p><p>  The rationale behind the change is to restrict TB to the area/herd where it is first disclosed and to protect herdowners with clear herds from buying in infected animals.  Prior to this change, herdowners were permitted to move animals from their holdings pending the TB test and many farmers took advantage of this to sell on TB infected cattle, bringing down otherwise clear herds.  Department statistics show that, in 2011, the risk of moving infected TB animals out of herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown is three times greater than in the case of cattle moving from a normal herd.</p><p>  The change to the contiguous testing programme has been effective in that there has been a significant increase in the incidence of TB in contiguous herds in 2012 compared with 2011, indicating that the new controls are successful in detecting more TB in contiguous herds, thereby preventing infected animals from being moved from these herds to clear herds.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.</p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputies are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.</p></reply>

If an Article 17 Notice has not been issued by the AAI, then Section 68 of the Act does not apply.

According to the HSE the waiting time for assessments varies around the country and, in general, the maximum waiting time is 12 months.  The Adoption Authority informs me that the waiting times between the sending of an adoption application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries may vary greatly and may extend to as much as 3 years or more in some cases.  The Adoption Authority has no influence with regard to the waiting times involved in these sending countries.   </p><p>  A large number of declarations are currently valid and several hundred are issued by the Authority each year.  The Adoption Authority has been proactive in developing relationships with its Hague counterparts in a number of jurisdictions.  The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries.  However, the reality is that the landscape of intercountry adoption is changing and for a variety of reasons the number of referrals of adoptable children has declined and as a result there are fewer adoptions finalised each year than declarations issued.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  One of the requirements for the higher capitation is that the pre-school leader holds a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full level 7 award on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have been successful in maintaining the ECCE programme as a free and universal programme despite the reduced funding available to my Department.

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. Given that the policy has been reviewed by the Forum on Fluoridation and that the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health continues to provide impartial, evidence-based, expert advice on fluoridation, a further review is not considered necessary.</p></reply>

Under UHI, every citizen will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services. A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy. While primary and hospital care will be funded mainly via the UHI system, specialised and social care services, including long term care, will be funded by general taxation. Although funded separately, these services will still be delivered in an integrated manner around the needs of the person.  </p></reply>

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.</p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  My Department has also been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed.  10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved.  My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.1190.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100096#WRBB02700"><p>Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes significantly strengthens the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing.  The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform project evaluations including harm benefit analysis prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p><p>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.</p><p>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.</p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.</p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.</p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny</i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.</p></reply>

The type of support provided is:<blockquote>-Inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness;<br /><br />-Air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK;<br /><br />-Air transport of organ retrieval teams within Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals;<br /><br />-Air transport of paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.</blockquote>Under the Treatment Abroad Scheme, the HSE arranges transport, including land and air ambulance transport, through an agreed protocol, for patients requiring treatment in other jurisdictions. Pre-approved commercial providers are used on occasion, where no suitable state asset is available.</p><p>The NAS is currently running, with the Irish Air Corps, a twelve month emergency aeromedical service (EAS) trial. The trial provides dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west of Ireland, specifically where the land transit time from an incident to an appropriate facility may not be clinically appropriate. The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent, if any, of the need for dedicated aeromedical support to emergency ambulances in the region, in light of existing road networks and transit times, and how it might best be provided in the longer term. The primary focus is in the west and northwest, including HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.  The service may respond to incidents elsewhere, where aeromedical assistance is appropriate, given the circumstances of the incident.</p></reply>

In domiciliary care situations where the patient is receiving care in their own home, prescription medicines must be prescribed for the patient by a medical practitioner or nurse prescriber. The medicines must be dispensed by a pharmacist for the individual patient, and appropriate records must be kept by both the prescriber and the pharmacist.  Persons providing domiciliary care services are required by law to administer medicines in accordance with the prescription and the instructions of the patient's prescriber. In addition, for certain patients who are experiencing difficulties in managing their own medicines at home, many pharmacies will dispense medicines in a monitored dosage system which will help the patient to adhere to their particular medication schedule.</p><p>  Residential care services are services where care is provided to the patient / resident in centres such as nursing homes and other residential facilities. The Health Information and Quality Authority has issued general standards for residential care centres providing care to older persons which set out range of requirements to be complied with including standards on the management of  patients' / residents' medicines in these care settings. In addition, An Bord Altranais has issued professional guidance to nurses regarding the appropriate management and administration of medicines to patients in such residential care settings and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has also issued professional guidance to all pharmacists involved in the dispensing and supply of medicines to these patients. </p></reply>

For 2011, the total outturn for specialist Disability Services, as outlined in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was  &#8364;1.576 billion. </p><p>  Expenditure on disability services provided for in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was &#8364;1.541 billion.</p><p>  The range of specialist disability services provided to people with disabilities includes:</p><p>- Residential</p><p>- Respite</p><p>- Day</p><p>- Personal Assistant</p><p>- Home Support</p><p>- Multidisciplinary supports</p><p>  The funding situation for the disability sector in 2013 is not yet available pending the finalisation of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. Savings required globally from the Health Budget will have an impact on all services, including disability services, and it is expected that these will be outlined later this month when the Minister for Health approves the National Service Plan.</p><p>The commitment in the Programme for Government is to <i>'move a proportion of public spending to a personal budget model so that people with disabilities or their families have the flexibility to make choices that suit their needs best</i>&#8217;'.  It has not yet been determined whether this will require legislative change.</p><p>  The move towards a personal budget model is encompassed by the recommendations in the recently published Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services, which addresses the wider area of individualised budgeting and person-centred supports and services. In that context, the Minister for Health intends that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting, once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service.</p><p>  The remaining issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of clients deemed to require or who received such services in 2011 and 2012 are more appropriate for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, the Department has asked the HSE to provide the details requested directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

On 3 December, which is the most recent data available, the number of delayed discharges nationally was 589, representing a decrease of 10.2% on the November average. Of these, a third (195) were awaiting discharge for under two weeks and a further 124 were awaiting discharge for under four weeks. </p><p>  To address this issue, the SDU has worked with the Clinical Care Programme on the Elderly and the HSE on proposals for a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service transitional care initiative.  This will speed up access and egress from acute care (reducing ED times, length of stay, and delayed discharges). The scheme commenced in the latter half of this year and involves the provision of home supports, transitional care beds and rehabilitation beds. So far under this initiative, which commenced in the latter half of the year, more than 6,500 home supports hour have been provided, more than 300 patients discharged to transitional care or rehabilitation beds and approximately 10,000 bed days have been saved within the acute hospital system.</p><p>  This initiative is about improving the patient experience and outcomes for our frail older people.  The initiative will also underpin significant savings in bed days through moving from acute beds to transitional and rehabilitation beds and through reduction in the average length of stay for patients in acute beds.</p></reply>

Mainstream Home Help and enhanced Home Care Package services  are core to not only realising the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the wider care system. The demand for these services, and for additional community based supports such as Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care, will continue as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of home support services is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times.</p><p>  In addition, the Special Delivery Unit, the HSE and the Department have been working on a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service &quot;home to home&quot; initiative. This joined up approach seeks to speed up access and egress from Acute Hospitals with the aim of reducing ED wait times, reducing length of stay, and significantly reducing delayed discharges, as well as significantly reducing the numbers going into Long Term Residential Care.  The scheme commenced in the latter half of this year and involves the provision of home supports, transitional care beds and rehabilitation beds.In the wider context, the issue raised by the Deputy is being progressed by the Executive under  its National Clinical Programme for Older People, one of the objectives of which is to improve the management of acutely ill frail older adults in acute hospitals.</p><p>  The Government's intention is to continue to maximise the use of all of the above initiatives, in the overall context of health reform and resource availability.</p></reply>

Up to end October, a total of 504 beds have closed and it is not envisaged that the figure of 555 bed closures will be reached.</p><p>  In the absence of reform, bed closures result in increased cost of care within the public system, undermining the viability of public units and reducing the overall number of older people who can be supported within the Fair Deal budget. As this is not a sustainable position, a more pro-active approach is needed, with a combination of actions required such as consolidation of services; changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices; provision of a variety of services including transitional care, and alternative options for service provision in the community.  In that context, the Minister for Health requested the HSE to carry out a viability review of its public facilities. The review, which is just being finalised, aims to identify the maximum number of beds and public residential units that could be retained in each region, within existing financial and staffing resources. The review focused on a number of areas including the unit's ability to meet HIQA standards in terms of environmental matters such as the age and structure of the unit; staffing availability; and factors including location and stock.</p><p>  The HSE is working closely with the Department to develop an overall sets of proposals for the Minister.</p></reply>

All agency staff employed through agencies contracted by the HSE have now had their basic pay adjusted in accordance with the Act.  The majority of Agency Nurses engaged in the HSE by Nurse on Call have been paid their retrospection.  In relation to the other contracted agencies, the verification process is ongoing, however it is now expected that this will complete early in the new year, at which the remainder of Agency Staff will be paid their retrospection.</p><p>  Details on agency workers employed in Navan, County Meath is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and as such, the Deputy's enquiry has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

At the meeting a presentation was made in relation to Tallaght's performance to date covering various topics including activity, waiting list and the financial position.   </p><p>  On 29 August, the CEO of Tallaght wrote to the Department outlining the financial position.  Subsequently on 6 September, there was a meeting with the HSE and Tallaght, including the Chairman of the Board of Tallaght, at which the Department was represented. A presentation was made by the Director of Finance, Tallaght regarding the financial position.  </p><p>  Tallaght, like every other hospital is facing significant financial challenges.  The HSE has had regular ongoing engagement with the hospital with a view to ensuring that the hospital  continues to deliver its 2012 service plan commitments in addition to maximising the considerable financial resources at its disposal.</p><p>  Tallaght hospital has achieved significant operational savings in 2012 and has reduced its year-on-year spending by 6%, despite a 5% increase in inpatient numbers, a 6% increase in Emergency Department admissions and a 9% reduction in its 2012 allocation.  Tallaght has achieved HSE targets for reductions in agency and overtime costs and its absenteeism is consistently lower than the HSE national target. It has also considerably reduced the average length of stay times and ED, inpatient and day case waiting times as well as practically eliminating hospital trolleys.</p><p>  The hospital&rsquo;s staff has displayed great commitment to improving its performance and I am confident that this commitment will greatly assist in addressing Tallaght's current financial difficulties.</p></reply>

While incidents of serious and violent crime continue to be committed and have a substantial impact on victims and their families, it is important to note that the most recent recorded crime statistics, which are for the 12 month period to the end of June 2012, show that most categories of crime are in fact falling.  This reflects well on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the figures show that murder had decreased by 8% and assault offences were down by 9.7%.  Public order and damage to property offences were also down (by 13.1% and 10.8% respectively).</p><p>  Notwithstanding the positive messages from the latest crime figures, it remains imperative that we confront and disrupt violent criminals and the Garda&iacute; have the full support of the Government in this.  I am advised that Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  There is already a range of strong legislation in place to counter the sorts of crime referred to by the Deputy and I have also made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that if he feels there are other measures which might usefully be taken I will look at that very positively. </p></reply>

In this context the Garda authorities have indicated that significant resources have been, and will continue to be, devoted to tackling organised crime.  </p><p>  As the  Deputy will be aware the Garda&iacute; are bearing down very hard on criminal gangs.  Week in week out, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is making arrests and bringing persons before the courts, with substantial sentences being imposed in many cases.  Considerable success has also been achieved in disrupting the illicit drugs trade on which much organised crime depends.  In excess of &euro;90m of drugs were seized in the first nine months of the year, including the largest inland seizure of cocaine in Ireland.  Other seizures are taking place on a continuous basis.  </p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recent years considerable progress has been made within the Force in the deployment of modern technological support in the fight against organised crime.  These advances include the full roll out of the National Digital Radio System, the Automated Fingerprint Information System and Automated Number Plate Recognition.</p><p>  With regard to transport, the Deputy will be aware that a recent investment of &euro;3 million in the Garda fleet has resulted in an order for 170 new vehicles being placed this year. These vehicles are due to begin coming on stream in the coming weeks.  This investment brings to more than 210 the number of new vehicles ordered this year, at a cost of &euro;4 million.  In addition, a further &euro;5 million is being made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  </p><p>  This level of expenditure, at a time of severe budgetary constraint, represents a very significant investment in Garda transport.  I have no doubt that the additional funding, in conjunction with the advanced policing technologies available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will contribute to the effectiveness of the force in preventing and detecting organised crime.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces have participated in UNTSO since 1958.  Defence Forces personnel serving with this mission are based in Syria, Israel and Lebanon.  The main functions of UNTSO are to maintain regional dialogue, monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements and to assist UN peacekeeping operations in Lebanon and Syria.  The six UNTSO Defence Forces personnel based in Syria are part of Observer Group Golan responsible for the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.  One Irish officer is the Chief of Observer Group Golan and has responsibility for the conduct of operations by UN Military Observers within Israeli Occupied Golan and Syria.  The remaining five Defence Forces personnel are deployed as UN Military Observers and conduct their duties in support of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.  Their duties include manning Observation Posts, conducting fortnightly inspections of the deployment of Syrian Arab Armed Forces and conducting patrols within the Area of Limitation in order to ensure that no activities occur which could lead to the breach of the ceasefire between Israel and Syria.</p><p>  As the security situation in Syria remains highly volatile, Defence Forces personnel normally based in Damascus were relocated by UNTSO to offices and accommodation at UNDOF Headquarters in the Golan Heights, on 15 October 2012, as a temporary force protection measure.  The Irish personnel continue to fulfill their roles from this temporary location.  It is intended that they will return to offices and accommodation in Damascus should there be an improvement in the security situation.</p><p>  Six members of the Permanent Defence Force who had been deployed as unarmed military observers to the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) were withdrawn in August 2012 when the mission&#8217;s mandate came to an end.</p></reply>

These can be brought forward through a variety of means such as Codes of Practice, Regulations or other primary legislation, which can lay down more detailed laws for specific animals in certain cases, such as the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, which was brought forward by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and local Government.  That Act sets out detailed rules applying to premises at which bitches are kept, &ldquo;not less than 6 of which are more than 6 months old, and capable of being used for breeding purposes&rdquo;.

The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority confirmed on 4 December last that this vessel, based on pairing arrangements, did land the required amount in the first management period and so the vessel was included in the second management period.  A quota notification for this vessel issued on 4 December 2012.  In relation to the requirement to land 50% of the first period allocation to qualify for the second fishing period, I received a large number of appeals due to a variety of reasons such as bad weather, mechanical breakdown and size.  A number of small inshore vessels had advised that they were unable to participate due to their size, weather conditions and the location of the stock.  In view of this, I have decided to vary the management arrangements to remove the 50% landing requirement.  In order to implement an effect management regime for the remainder of the fishery, I decided that any vessel which has booked in shall receive an allocation for a two-week period from 00:01 on 9 December 2012 to 00.01 on 21 December 2012.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.1613.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100097#WRY00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405, 406 and 407 together.</p><p>  This matter centres on a vessel bought in Europe which turned out to be unstable and was unfit to go to sea.  The owner of the vessel has consistently said that the paperwork supplied and the expert employed to survey the vessel at the time of purchase indicated that there was no problem with the stability of the vessel. I understand that vessel in question<font color="#004080"> </font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   </p><p>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.</p><p>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.</p><p>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  </p><p>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. </i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    </p><p>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.</p><p>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.</p><p>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  </p><p>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  </p><p>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.</p></reply>

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  </p><p>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  </i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    </p><p>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.</p></reply>

These powers include the making of bye-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the local authorities&rsquo; functional area, together with provisions on licensing of horses within control areas and seizure and detention of stray or abandoned horses.  My officials are in ongoing contact with Local Authority representatives to underline that  effective implementation of Control of Horses Act by them can assist with controlling horses and reducing potential horse welfare problems developing, particularly with regard to horses that are straying and or abandoned.</p><p>  My Department also provides financial assistance to Local Authorities to assist in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act. To date this year, almost &euro;2m has been provided for this purpose.</p><p>  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill which I am bringing forward consolidates a wide range of existing legislation.  As such, it will apply in a wide range of situations affecting the welfare of animals and will be enforceable by a range of state bodies such as An Garda, customs officers and local authorities. The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill sets out general horizontal rules on health and welfare that will apply to all animals.  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill does not set out detailed rules for individual species or sectors. These can be dealt with through a variety of means such as Codes Of Practice, Regulations or other primary legislation which can lay down more detailed laws for different species in certain cases such as, for example, The Control of Horses Act. This Act already contains provisions enabling the local authorities to stable horses prior to determining their status. I should add that all owners or persons in charge of premises where horses are kept are required to register these premises under the Diseases of Animals (Registration of Equine Premises) Order 2012 (SI No 8 of 2012).</p></reply>

The new arrangements for contiguous testing provide that herds which are contiguous to a high risk TB breakdown and which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be trade restricted pending a full herd test.  Such herds will be immediately de-restricted once they pass a TB herd test. </p><p>  The rationale behind the change is to restrict TB to the area/herd where it is first disclosed and to protect herdowners with clear herds from buying in infected animals.  Prior to this change, herdowners were permitted to move animals from their holdings pending the TB test and many farmers took advantage of this to sell on TB infected cattle, bringing down otherwise clear herds.  Department statistics show that, in 2011, the risk of moving infected TB animals out of herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown is three times greater than in the case of cattle moving from a normal herd.</p><p>  The change to the contiguous testing programme has been effective in that there has been a significant increase in the incidence of TB in contiguous herds in 2012 compared with 2011, indicating that the new controls are successful in detecting more TB in contiguous herds, thereby preventing infected animals from being moved from these herds to clear herds.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.</p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputies are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.</p></reply>

If an Article 17 Notice has not been issued by the AAI, then Section 68 of the Act does not apply.  Prospective adoptive parents resident in Ireland and having custody of a child for the purposes of adoption should contact their local HSE Regional Adoption Service and seek independent legal advice on their options.

According to the HSE the waiting time for assessments varies around the country and, in general, the maximum waiting time is 12 months.  The Adoption Authority informs me that the waiting times between the sending of an adoption application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries may vary greatly and may extend to as much as 3 years or more in some cases.  The Adoption Authority has no influence with regard to the waiting times involved in these sending countries.   </p><p>  A large number of declarations are currently valid and several hundred are issued by the Authority each year.  The Adoption Authority has been proactive in developing relationships with its Hague counterparts in a number of jurisdictions.  The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries.  However, the reality is that the landscape of intercountry adoption is changing and for a variety of reasons the number of referrals of adoptable children has declined and as a result there are fewer adoptions finalised each year than declarations issued.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  One of the requirements for the higher capitation is that the pre-school leader holds a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full level 7 award on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have been successful in maintaining the ECCE programme as a free and universal programme despite the reduced funding available to my Department.

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. Given that the policy has been reviewed by the Forum on Fluoridation and that the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health continues to provide impartial, evidence-based, expert advice on fluoridation, a further review is not considered necessary.</p></reply>

Under UHI, every citizen will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services. A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy. While primary and hospital care will be funded mainly via the UHI system, specialised and social care services, including long term care, will be funded by general taxation. Although funded separately, these services will still be delivered in an integrated manner around the needs of the person.  </p></reply>

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.</p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  My Department has also been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed.  10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved.  My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-12-11a.1785.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012121100097#WRBB02700"><p>Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes significantly strengthens the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing.  The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform project evaluations including harm benefit analysis prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p><p>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.</p><p>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.</p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.</p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.</p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny</i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.</p></reply>

The type of support provided is:<blockquote>-Inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness;<br /><br />-Air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK;<br /><br />-Air transport of organ retrieval teams within Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals;<br /><br />-Air transport of paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.</blockquote>Under the Treatment Abroad Scheme, the HSE arranges transport, including land and air ambulance transport, through an agreed protocol, for patients requiring treatment in other jurisdictions. Pre-approved commercial providers are used on occasion, where no suitable state asset is available.</p><p>The NAS is currently running, with the Irish Air Corps, a twelve month emergency aeromedical service (EAS) trial. The trial provides dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west of Ireland, specifically where the land transit time from an incident to an appropriate facility may not be clinically appropriate. The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent, if any, of the need for dedicated aeromedical support to emergency ambulances in the region, in light of existing road networks and transit times, and how it might best be provided in the longer term. The primary focus is in the west and northwest, including HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.  The service may respond to incidents elsewhere, where aeromedical assistance is appropriate, given the circumstances of the incident.</p></reply>

In domiciliary care situations where the patient is receiving care in their own home, prescription medicines must be prescribed for the patient by a medical practitioner or nurse prescriber. The medicines must be dispensed by a pharmacist for the individual patient, and appropriate records must be kept by both the prescriber and the pharmacist.  Persons providing domiciliary care services are required by law to administer medicines in accordance with the prescription and the instructions of the patient's prescriber. In addition, for certain patients who are experiencing difficulties in managing their own medicines at home, many pharmacies will dispense medicines in a monitored dosage system which will help the patient to adhere to their particular medication schedule.</p><p>  Residential care services are services where care is provided to the patient / resident in centres such as nursing homes and other residential facilities. The Health Information and Quality Authority has issued general standards for residential care centres providing care to older persons which set out range of requirements to be complied with including standards on the management of  patients' / residents' medicines in these care settings. In addition, An Bord Altranais has issued professional guidance to nurses regarding the appropriate management and administration of medicines to patients in such residential care settings and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has also issued professional guidance to all pharmacists involved in the dispensing and supply of medicines to these patients. </p></reply>

For 2011, the total outturn for specialist Disability Services, as outlined in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was  &#8364;1.576 billion. </p><p>  Expenditure on disability services provided for in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was &#8364;1.541 billion.</p><p>  The range of specialist disability services provided to people with disabilities includes:</p><p>- Residential</p><p>- Respite</p><p>- Day</p><p>- Personal Assistant</p><p>- Home Support</p><p>- Multidisciplinary supports</p><p>  The funding situation for the disability sector in 2013 is not yet available pending the finalisation of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. Savings required globally from the Health Budget will have an impact on all services, including disability services, and it is expected that these will be outlined later this month when the Minister for Health approves the National Service Plan.</p><p>The commitment in the Programme for Government is to <i>'move a proportion of public spending to a personal budget model so that people with disabilities or their families have the flexibility to make choices that suit their needs best</i>&#8217;'.  It has not yet been determined whether this will require legislative change.</p><p>  The move towards a personal budget model is encompassed by the recommendations in the recently published Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services, which addresses the wider area of individualised budgeting and person-centred supports and services. In that context, the Minister for Health intends that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting, once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service.</p><p>  The remaining issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of clients deemed to require or who received such services in 2011 and 2012 are more appropriate for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, the Department has asked the HSE to provide the details requested directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

On 3 December, which is the most recent data available, the number of delayed discharges nationally was 589, representing a decrease of 10.2% on the November average. Of these, a third (195) were awaiting discharge for under two weeks and a further 124 were awaiting discharge for under four weeks. </p><p>  To address this issue, the SDU has worked with the Clinical Care Programme on the Elderly and the HSE on proposals for a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service transitional care initiative.  This will speed up access and egress from acute care (reducing ED times, length of stay, and delayed discharges). The scheme commenced in the latter half of this year and involves the provision of home supports, transitional care beds and rehabilitation beds. So far under this initiative, which commenced in the latter half of the year, more than 6,500 home supports hour have been provided, more than 300 patients discharged to transitional care or rehabilitation beds and approximately 10,000 bed days have been saved within the acute hospital system.</p><p>  This initiative is about improving the patient experience and outcomes for our frail older people.  The initiative will also underpin significant savings in bed days through moving from acute beds to transitional and rehabilitation beds and through reduction in the average length of stay for patients in acute beds.</p></reply>

Mainstream Home Help and enhanced Home Care Package services  are core to not only realising the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the wider care system. The demand for these services, and for additional community based supports such as Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care, will continue as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of home support services is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times.</p><p>  In addition, the Special Delivery Unit, the HSE and the Department have been working on a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service &quot;home to home&quot; initiative. This joined up approach seeks to speed up access and egress from Acute Hospitals with the aim of reducing ED wait times, reducing length of stay, and significantly reducing delayed discharges, as well as significantly reducing the numbers going into Long Term Residential Care.  The scheme commenced in the latter half of this year and involves the provision of home supports, transitional care beds and rehabilitation beds.In the wider context, the issue raised by the Deputy is being progressed by the Executive under  its National Clinical Programme for Older People, one of the objectives of which is to improve the management of acutely ill frail older adults in acute hospitals.</p><p>  The Government's intention is to continue to maximise the use of all of the above initiatives, in the overall context of health reform and resource availability.</p></reply>

Up to end October, a total of 504 beds have closed and it is not envisaged that the figure of 555 bed closures will be reached.</p><p>  In the absence of reform, bed closures result in increased cost of care within the public system, undermining the viability of public units and reducing the overall number of older people who can be supported within the Fair Deal budget. As this is not a sustainable position, a more pro-active approach is needed, with a combination of actions required such as consolidation of services; changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices; provision of a variety of services including transitional care, and alternative options for service provision in the community.  In that context, the Minister for Health requested the HSE to carry out a viability review of its public facilities. The review, which is just being finalised, aims to identify the maximum number of beds and public residential units that could be retained in each region, within existing financial and staffing resources. The review focused on a number of areas including the unit's ability to meet HIQA standards in terms of environmental matters such as the age and structure of the unit; staffing availability; and factors including location and stock.</p><p>  The HSE is working closely with the Department to develop an overall sets of proposals for the Minister.</p></reply>

All agency staff employed through agencies contracted by the HSE have now had their basic pay adjusted in accordance with the Act.  The majority of Agency Nurses engaged in the HSE by Nurse on Call have been paid their retrospection.  In relation to the other contracted agencies, the verification process is ongoing, however it is now expected that this will complete early in the new year, at which the remainder of Agency Staff will be paid their retrospection.</p><p>  Details on agency workers employed in Navan, County Meath is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and as such, the Deputy's enquiry has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

At the meeting a presentation was made in relation to Tallaght's performance to date covering various topics including activity, waiting list and the financial position.   </p><p>  On 29 August, the CEO of Tallaght wrote to the Department outlining the financial position.  Subsequently on 6 September, there was a meeting with the HSE and Tallaght, including the Chairman of the Board of Tallaght, at which the Department was represented. A presentation was made by the Director of Finance, Tallaght regarding the financial position.  </p><p>  Tallaght, like every other hospital is facing significant financial challenges.  The HSE has had regular ongoing engagement with the hospital with a view to ensuring that the hospital  continues to deliver its 2012 service plan commitments in addition to maximising the considerable financial resources at its disposal.</p><p>  Tallaght hospital has achieved significant operational savings in 2012 and has reduced its year-on-year spending by 6%, despite a 5% increase in inpatient numbers, a 6% increase in Emergency Department admissions and a 9% reduction in its 2012 allocation.  Tallaght has achieved HSE targets for reductions in agency and overtime costs and its absenteeism is consistently lower than the HSE national target. It has also considerably reduced the average length of stay times and ED, inpatient and day case waiting times as well as practically eliminating hospital trolleys.</p><p>  The hospital&rsquo;s staff has displayed great commitment to improving its performance and I am confident that this commitment will greatly assist in addressing Tallaght's current financial difficulties.</p></reply>

The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority confirmed on 4 December last that this vessel, based on pairing arrangements, did land the required amount in the first management period and so the vessel was included in the second management period.  A quota notification for this vessel issued on 4 December 2012.  In relation to the requirement to land 50% of the first period allocation to qualify for the second fishing period, I received a large number of appeals due to a variety of reasons such as bad weather, mechanical breakdown and size.  A number of small inshore vessels had advised that they were unable to participate due to their size, weather conditions and the location of the stock.  In view of this, I have decided to vary the management arrangements to remove the 50% landing requirement.  In order to implement an effect management regime for the remainder of the fishery, I decided that any vessel which has booked in shall receive an allocation for a two-week period from 00:01 on 9 December 2012 to 00.01 on 21 December 2012.</p></reply>

The owner of the vessel has consistently said that the paperwork supplied and the expert employed to survey the vessel at the time of purchase indicated that there was no problem with the stability of the vessel. I understand that vessel in question<font color="#004080"> </font>  failed a stability test by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of the Department of Transport in 2009.   </p><p>  The failures in the stability of the fishing vessel were determined after its purchase by the new Irish owner.  The reality that these failures were not detected at the time of purchase by the new owner is a private matter between the owners and the sellers of the vessel and the relevant experts involved in surveying and certifying the vessel, none of which are employed by the State or were acting on behalf of the State.  The State does not have responsibility for the failures in this private business transaction, no matter how unfortunate the case may be. I am sympathetic to the very unfortunate situation that the owner finds himself in but it is not due to any failure on the part of the State and there are no remedies open to me to address the situation in which the vessel owner finds himself.</p><p>  My Department has no function in this safety matter, other than that the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority must ensure that a vessel has a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate prior to licensing.  The Authority is not empowered to vary or indeed waive the legal safety requirements set down by the Maritime Safety Directorate of the Department of Transport.</p><p>  To resolve the stability problems of his vessel, I understand that the owner lengthened his vessel by 6 metres. As the vessel was larger, the owner requires additional capacity to licence the vessel. Capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset and my Department has no direct role in that private market.  In February 2011, in order to licence the vessel without purchasing the additional capacity required, the owner made an application for &#8216;safety tonnage&#8217; to the Registrar General of Fishing Boats. I understand that the Registrar is awaiting certification of the modifications to the vessel from the Marine Survey Office before a decision is made in relation to the safety tonnage application.  </p><p>  The owner previously made a request to my Department to be granted a scallop authorisation and effort allocation in order to allow the owner to participate in the scallop fisheries<i>. </i> Under the national policy for the fishing fleet, vessels permitted to participate in the scallop fishery are ring fenced within the fleet and only vessels with the necessary scallop entitlement in their sea fishing boat licence are permitted to participate in that fishery.  The vessel in question is registered in the Beamer segment of the Irish Fishing Fleet and does not have the necessary track record to be licensed in the scallop sub-segments of the fleet.  The owner&#8217;s proposal would require that the vessel would be licensed in the Polyvalent (scallop sub segment) or Specific (scallop sub segment) segments. There is no scope in the national policy to transfer from the Beamer segment to the Polyvalent or Specific segments, other than by providing 100% capacity from those segments with the required scallop track record.  This capacity is a privately owned tradeable asset on the open market and must be provided at a ratio of 1:1 as part of the licensing process.    </p><p>  Fleet policy, including policy on segmentation of the fleet, is set by me under section 3(2) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, as amended by section 99 of the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I am precluded by that Act from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned.  It is not an option, therefore, for me to amend national policy on segmentation of the fleet for the purpose of assisting the owner in moving to another segment of the fleet, no matter how sympathetic I may be to his situation. The same situation applies in relation to requests from the owner to move to the Refrigerated Sea Water Segment Pelagic segment of the fleet.</p><p>  More recently, the owner of the vessel has expressed a desire to decommission his vessel.  Decommissioning of fishing vessels is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006   (EFF Regulation) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 which provides for rules implementing schemes co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund. Article 23 of the EFF Regulation provides for the European Fisheries Fund to contribute to financing of the permanent cessation of fishing activities of fishing vessels, provided that such cessation forms part of a Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan prepared by the Member State and approved by the Commission as part of the Member State&#8217;s Operational Programme.</p><p>  There is at present no decommissioning scheme in operation. The last decommissioning scheme for vessels was undertaken in 2008 and implemented the fleet restructuring objectives set out in the National Strategic Plan for the Fisheries Sector 2007-2013, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the EFF Regulation and which was submitted to and adopted by the Commission.  </p><p>  The 2008 Decommissioning Scheme required that a vessel be registered/licensed, comply with all relevant legislation, be capable of putting to sea at the time of application and have carried out fishing activity for at least 75 days at sea in both of two periods of 12 months preceding 31 December 2007, or have carried out a fishing activity for at least 150 days at sea in the 12 month period preceding 31 December 2007.  The Scheme sought to remove active fishing vessels and their fishing capacity from the fleet register to reduce fishing effort in certain whitefish fisheries and thereby improve the viability of the fisheries for other active vessels.  I understand that the vessel in question has not been licensed since 30 September 2009 and is therefore not an active vessel. Should a new decommissioning scheme be introduced at a future date with similar eligibility requirements, the vessel would not qualify under its present circumstances.  </p><p>  A new decommissioning scheme for any category of vessels or more generally could only be considered where a strong case has been made by the fishing industry representative bodies and that case was considered valid and the most appropriate use of scarce funds available for the development of the seafood sector, including the limited co-funding available from the European Fisheries Fund.  It is likely that a revised Fishing Effort Adjustment Plan would be required and this would need to be approved by the European Commission.  I have no plans at this time to introduce such a scheme which would in any event have to target a category or categories of vessels based on a range of broad and transparent criteria.</p></reply>

However, since the beginning of 2012 the EU, in partnership with the G20, has supported an international market information system (AMIS) to provide transparency in relation to food prices.  They have also supported the creation of a Rapid Response Forum, which has senior officials from all over the world in constant contact to react to challenging situations such as the global crop failures that occurred during 2012.  </p><p>  The cooperation between governments has led to fewer trade-distorting reactions like the export bans witnessed in 2010.  The poor harvests this summer led to rapid price increases for key food commodities, but the increases quickly stabilised.  Rice prices are lower now than a year ago, while wheat, maize and soya have increased between 14% and 23%.  Prices for all of these commodities are still very high by historical standards but the price increases experienced so far in 2012 have not led to major market shocks. The latest market monitor, published by AMIS this month, shows a tightening of wheat and maize stocks, but a good supply of rice and soya beans. It also states that Markets stabilized in recent weeks as forecasts for 2012/13 balances of AMIS crops became more definite<i>.  </i>The FAO food price index for 2012 has remained below the 2011 figure despite the poorer harvests this year.    </p><p>  Weather both at home and abroad and the consequent effects on price volatility and input prices meant a more difficult time for Irish farmers after a couple of relatively positive years. The latest input and output figures from the CSO (issued 7 December 2012) showed a 10% drop in operating surplus for the agriculture sector.  In particular, the sector had to bear an increase in intermediate consumption of 6.9% or &#8364;335.7m, half of which was accounted for by additional expenditure on feedingstuffs.  High world prices for key food commodities affect Irish farmers, whose incomes will decline by over 20% in 2012.  However, the sector remains healthy despite the temporary setbacks this year and is well placed to bounce back in 2013.</p></reply>

These powers include the making of bye-laws for the control and welfare of horses in the local authorities&rsquo; functional area, together with provisions on licensing of horses within control areas and seizure and detention of stray or abandoned horses.  My officials are in ongoing contact with Local Authority representatives to underline that  effective implementation of Control of Horses Act by them can assist with controlling horses and reducing potential horse welfare problems developing, particularly with regard to horses that are straying and or abandoned.</p><p>  My Department also provides financial assistance to Local Authorities to assist in their work in implementing the Control of Horses Act. To date this year, almost &euro;2m has been provided for this purpose.</p><p>  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill which I am bringing forward consolidates a wide range of existing legislation.  As such, it will apply in a wide range of situations affecting the welfare of animals and will be enforceable by a range of state bodies such as An Garda, customs officers and local authorities. The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill sets out general horizontal rules on health and welfare that will apply to all animals.  The Animal Health &amp; Welfare Bill does not set out detailed rules for individual species or sectors. These can be dealt with through a variety of means such as Codes Of Practice, Regulations or other primary legislation which can lay down more detailed laws for different species in certain cases such as, for example, The Control of Horses Act. This Act already contains provisions enabling the local authorities to stable horses prior to determining their status. I should add that all owners or persons in charge of premises where horses are kept are required to register these premises under the Diseases of Animals (Registration of Equine Premises) Order 2012 (SI No 8 of 2012).</p></reply>

The new arrangements for contiguous testing provide that herds which are contiguous to a high risk TB breakdown and which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be trade restricted pending a full herd test.  Such herds will be immediately de-restricted once they pass a TB herd test. </p><p>  The rationale behind the change is to restrict TB to the area/herd where it is first disclosed and to protect herdowners with clear herds from buying in infected animals.  Prior to this change, herdowners were permitted to move animals from their holdings pending the TB test and many farmers took advantage of this to sell on TB infected cattle, bringing down otherwise clear herds.  Department statistics show that, in 2011, the risk of moving infected TB animals out of herds which are contiguous to a high risk breakdown is three times greater than in the case of cattle moving from a normal herd.</p><p>  The change to the contiguous testing programme has been effective in that there has been a significant increase in the incidence of TB in contiguous herds in 2012 compared with 2011, indicating that the new controls are successful in detecting more TB in contiguous herds, thereby preventing infected animals from being moved from these herds to clear herds.</p></reply>

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.  This includes the full range of child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.  It has also been decided that due to its particular relevance domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services will also be included within the Agency's responsibilities.  The Government has further decided that the new Agency will assume responsibility for the functions of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  These two organisations currently operate under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  </p><p>  The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The programme funds 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.  Funding of over &euro;15m was provided to the Family Support Agency in respect of this programme in 2012.</p><p>  It is my intention that the work of the new agency will include a particular focus on the provision of services that could help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage and that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.  Therefore, in addition to child welfare and protection services there will be an emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions.  </p><p>  I can assure the Deputies that the focus of the new Agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the last decade.  The additional issues raised by the Deputies are being given consideration as part of the preparation of the legislation necessary to give effect to the establishment of the new agency.</p></reply>

According to the HSE the waiting time for assessments varies around the country and, in general, the maximum waiting time is 12 months.  The Adoption Authority informs me that the waiting times between the sending of an adoption application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries may vary greatly and may extend to as much as 3 years or more in some cases.  The Adoption Authority has no influence with regard to the waiting times involved in these sending countries.   </p><p>  A large number of declarations are currently valid and several hundred are issued by the Authority each year.  The Adoption Authority has been proactive in developing relationships with its Hague counterparts in a number of jurisdictions.  The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries.  However, the reality is that the landscape of intercountry adoption is changing and for a variety of reasons the number of referrals of adoptable children has declined and as a result there are fewer adoptions finalised each year than declarations issued.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the ECCE programme, the pre-school leaders delivering the programme must hold a certification for a major award in childcare/early education at a minimum of level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or an equivalent nationally-recognised qualification or a higher award in the childcare/early education field.  My Department has part-subsidised on-line courses, developed by one of the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations (NVCOs), for unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who wish to achieve a level 5 award.</p><p>  In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing standards in the pre-school sector, a higher capitation payment of &euro;73 per week is available to childcare services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme.  One of the requirements for the higher capitation is that the pre-school leader holds a qualification in a relevant discipline at a minimum of a full level 7 award on the NFQ.</p><p>  I have been successful in maintaining the ECCE programme as a free and universal programme despite the reduced funding available to my Department.  Funding of &euro;176 million is being made available this year to ensure that the increased cohort of eligible children have access to a quality free pre-school year.  </p></reply>

In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. Given that the policy has been reviewed by the Forum on Fluoridation and that the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health continues to provide impartial, evidence-based, expert advice on fluoridation, a further review is not considered necessary.</p></reply>

With this in mind, the current Programme for Government  includes a specific commitment to put the draft standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  These draft standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  A public consultation process has recently been completed by HIQA on the draft standards document and it is now in the process of being finalised and submitted to the Board of the Authority. The final agreed standards will then be forwarded to my Department for approval with an anticipated publication date in January 2013.  It is expected that the new regulatory system which will allow for a robust registration and inspection of Residential Centres should be up and running by mid 2013.</p><p>  Work is also continuing in my Department on both the 'Registration and Inspection' regulations and the 'Care and Welfare' regulations required to bring the standards into law.  These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from similar regulations for nursing homes.  My Department has also been in active engagement with HIQA on the level of resources and staffing needed.  10 posts which will enable the Authority commence preparatory work for the registration and inspection regime have already been approved.  My Department is continuing discussions with HIQA to determine the longer term staffing and resource requirements and these will be considered further in the context of the Department's 2013 estimates.  While the HIQA standards have yet to be put on a statutory footing, it is worth noting that compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector.</p></reply>

The Directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform project evaluations including harm benefit analysis prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.  The Directive will be transposed into Irish law by year end and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  I would like to draw the attention of the Deputy to the comments of European Environment Commissioner Potocnik who has said that the European Union will, once the Directive is transposed, have the highest standards of experimental animal welfare in the world.</p><p>  The Safeguard Clauses set out in this Directive covers exceptional circumstances in which Member States may, on scientifically justifiable grounds, provisionally authorise applications for derogations relating to a number of restrictions set out in the Directive including authorisation of procedures involving severe pain, suffering or distress that is likely to be long lasting and cannot be ameliorated.  Under Article 55(3), such exceptional provisional measures could, for example, be required to deal with an unexpected outbreak of a life threatening or debilitating clinical condition in humans or an outbreak of an highly infectious pathogenic disease.  The Safeguard Clauses would also allow for emergency measures in the event of a natural disaster that resulted in, for example, the contamination of land and livestock.  It will only be possible to introduce any such provisional measure by way of Ministerial Order after consultation with the Irish Medicines Board (the Competent Authority for the purposes of the Directive) and any such measure will be subject to EU Member State and Commission scrutiny and approval.  The European Commission, assisted by an Advisory Committee (composed of Member State representatives and chaired by the Commission) must, subsequently, authorise or disallow any such provisional authorisation.</p><p>  It is clear from the Directive that the replacement, refinement and reduction of animal testing is at the core of this legislation and I strongly endorse this objective.  Nevertheless, and even if difficult to foresee, it is my considered view that it is both reasonable and correct to make provision for exceptional emergency situations that might arise, if only to ensure that the necessary legislative tools are available to deal with such an eventuality.  The Directive provides Member States with the legislative tools needed to respond in an effective way to such situations. Not to incorporate such tools in our transposition of the Directive might prove to be most regrettable if fate were to take a hand.</p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive.  These views informed Ireland&#8217;s position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information.</p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard. The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the Directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the Directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.</p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the <i>Joint Committee on European Scrutiny</i>  on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new Directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the Directive without delay.  The Joint Committee, after consideration of the proposed Directive noted that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 Directive.  The Committee also recognised the scope allowed in the Directive for Member States to decide on practical transposition measures.</p></reply>

The type of support provided is:<blockquote>-Inter-hospital transfer of patients with spinal or other serious injury or illness;<br /><br />-Air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients requiring specialised emergency treatment in the UK;<br /><br />-Air transport of organ retrieval teams within Ireland;<br /><br />-Air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals;<br /><br />-Air transport of paediatric patients requiring immediate medical intervention in Ireland.</blockquote>Under the Treatment Abroad Scheme, the HSE arranges transport, including land and air ambulance transport, through an agreed protocol, for patients requiring treatment in other jurisdictions. Pre-approved commercial providers are used on occasion, where no suitable state asset is available.</p><p>The NAS is currently running, with the Irish Air Corps, a twelve month emergency aeromedical service (EAS) trial. The trial provides dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west of Ireland, specifically where the land transit time from an incident to an appropriate facility may not be clinically appropriate. The purpose of the trial is to determine the extent, if any, of the need for dedicated aeromedical support to emergency ambulances in the region, in light of existing road networks and transit times, and how it might best be provided in the longer term. The primary focus is in the west and northwest, including HSE Clinical Care Programmes such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.  The service may respond to incidents elsewhere, where aeromedical assistance is appropriate, given the circumstances of the incident.</p></reply>

In domiciliary care situations where the patient is receiving care in their own home, prescription medicines must be prescribed for the patient by a medical practitioner or nurse prescriber. The medicines must be dispensed by a pharmacist for the individual patient, and appropriate records must be kept by both the prescriber and the pharmacist.  Persons providing domiciliary care services are required by law to administer medicines in accordance with the prescription and the instructions of the patient's prescriber. In addition, for certain patients who are experiencing difficulties in managing their own medicines at home, many pharmacies will dispense medicines in a monitored dosage system which will help the patient to adhere to their particular medication schedule.</p><p>  Residential care services are services where care is provided to the patient / resident in centres such as nursing homes and other residential facilities. The Health Information and Quality Authority has issued general standards for residential care centres providing care to older persons which set out range of requirements to be complied with including standards on the management of  patients' / residents' medicines in these care settings. In addition, An Bord Altranais has issued professional guidance to nurses regarding the appropriate management and administration of medicines to patients in such residential care settings and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has also issued professional guidance to all pharmacists involved in the dispensing and supply of medicines to these patients. </p></reply>

For 2011, the total outturn for specialist Disability Services, as outlined in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was  &#8364;1.576 billion. </p><p>  Expenditure on disability services provided for in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 was &#8364;1.541 billion.</p><p>  The range of specialist disability services provided to people with disabilities includes:</p><p>- Residential</p><p>- Respite</p><p>- Day</p><p>- Personal Assistant</p><p>- Home Support</p><p>- Multidisciplinary supports</p><p>  The funding situation for the disability sector in 2013 is not yet available pending the finalisation of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2013. Savings required globally from the Health Budget will have an impact on all services, including disability services, and it is expected that these will be outlined later this month when the Minister for Health approves the National Service Plan.</p><p>The commitment in the Programme for Government is to <i>'move a proportion of public spending to a personal budget model so that people with disabilities or their families have the flexibility to make choices that suit their needs best</i>&#8217;'.  It has not yet been determined whether this will require legislative change.</p><p>  The move towards a personal budget model is encompassed by the recommendations in the recently published Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services, which addresses the wider area of individualised budgeting and person-centred supports and services. In that context, the Minister for Health intends that the actions recommended in the VFM Review will lay the groundwork for individualised budgeting, once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure its long-term viability. The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from a person-centred supports model and developing the administrative and governance infrastructure necessary for a more accountable and individualised service.</p><p>  The remaining issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of clients deemed to require or who received such services in 2011 and 2012 are more appropriate for the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, the Department has asked the HSE to provide the details requested directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

On 3 December, which is the most recent data available, the number of delayed discharges nationally was 589, representing a decrease of 10.2% on the November average. Of these, a third (195) were awaiting discharge for under two weeks and a further 124 were awaiting discharge for under four weeks. </p><p>  To address this issue, the SDU has worked with the Clinical Care Programme on the Elderly and the HSE on proposals for a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service transitional care initiative.  This will speed up access and egress from acute care (reducing ED times, length of stay, and delayed discharges). The scheme commenced in the latter half of this year and involves the provision of home supports, transitional care beds and rehabilitation beds. So far under this initiative, which commenced in the latter half of the year, more than 6,500 home supports hour have been provided, more than 300 patients discharged to transitional care or rehabilitation beds and approximately 10,000 bed days have been saved within the acute hospital system.</p><p>  This initiative is about improving the patient experience and outcomes for our frail older people.  The initiative will also underpin significant savings in bed days through moving from acute beds to transitional and rehabilitation beds and through reduction in the average length of stay for patients in acute beds.</p></reply>

Mainstream Home Help and enhanced Home Care Package services  are core to not only realising the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the wider care system. The demand for these services, and for additional community based supports such as Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care, will continue as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of home support services is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times.</p><p>  In addition, the Special Delivery Unit, the HSE and the Department have been working on a joint Acute Hospital/Community Service &quot;home to home&quot; initiative.

Up to end October, a total of 504 beds have closed and it is not envisaged that the figure of 555 bed closures will be reached.</p><p>  In the absence of reform, bed closures result in increased cost of care within the public system, undermining the viability of public units and reducing the overall number of older people who can be supported within the Fair Deal budget. As this is not a sustainable position, a more pro-active approach is needed, with a combination of actions required such as consolidation of services; changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices; provision of a variety of services including transitional care, and alternative options for service provision in the community.  In that context, the Minister for Health requested the HSE to carry out a viability review of its public facilities. The review, which is just being finalised, aims to identify the maximum number of beds and public residential units that could be retained in each region, within existing financial and staffing resources.

At the meeting a presentation was made in relation to Tallaght's performance to date covering various topics including activity, waiting list and the financial position.   </p><p>  On 29 August, the CEO of Tallaght wrote to the Department outlining the financial position.  Subsequently on 6 September, there was a meeting with the HSE and Tallaght, including the Chairman of the Board of Tallaght, at which the Department was represented. A presentation was made by the Director of Finance, Tallaght regarding the financial position.  </p><p>  Tallaght, like every other hospital is facing significant financial challenges.  The HSE has had regular ongoing engagement with the hospital with a view to ensuring that the hospital  continues to deliver its 2012 service plan commitments in addition to maximising the considerable financial resources at its disposal.</p><p>  Tallaght hospital has achieved significant operational savings in 2012 and has reduced its year-on-year spending by 6%, despite a 5% increase in inpatient numbers, a 6% increase in Emergency Department admissions and a 9% reduction in its 2012 allocation.  Tallaght has achieved HSE targets for reductions in agency and overtime costs and its absenteeism is consistently lower than the HSE national target. It has also considerably reduced the average length of stay times and ED, inpatient and day case waiting times as well as practically eliminating hospital trolleys.</p><p>  The hospital&rsquo;s staff has displayed great commitment to improving its performance and I am confident that this commitment will greatly assist in addressing Tallaght's current financial difficulties.</p></reply>
