I understand that SUSI has awarded a total of some 40,000 student grants, both new and renewals, up to end-October 2013. As at close of business on 24th November, 2013, 71% of new applications and 96% of renewal applications have been processed to completion. Of these 31,931 new applications have been awarded or provisionally awarded and 20,017 renewal applications have been awarded. 16,879 new applications and 2,722 renewal applications have been refused or cancelled.  SUSI is awaiting supporting documentation from 16,413 new applicants and 701 renewal applicants.  The remaining students with outstanding documentation are being requested to return their documentation as soon as possible so that assessment of their applications can be completed.</p></reply>

Full-time SNAs are required to work for the normal school hours in their school, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school. The specific hours of work are set locally by the school management and will vary depending on the school's requirements.</p><p>  Furthermore, SNAs are required to be available for an additional 72 hours annually to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p></reply>

The ERC has already completed two reports based on achievement testing, both focused in the Primary School Sector. This second report was published together with two Inspectorate reports on planning in DEIS Primary and Post-Primary Schools in January 2012. The ERC is finalising a further report based on testing carried out this year in urban Primary schools and is also carrying out an evaluation in DEIS Post-Primary schools. The published findings will be available to share with colleagues in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  My Department's Inspectorate and the Education and Training Inspectorate, Northern Ireland plan in 2014 to co-operate in each other's professional development programmes; inspector exchanges; joint inspections of specialised projects; and joint meetings of their senior management teams. The Inspectorates have jointly published a report on good practice in literacy and numeracy teaching in primary schools. They are currently working to publish in 2014 Best Practice Guidelines in Literacy Provision at Post-Primary Level, based on joint visits by inspectors to schools both jurisdictions. The Inspectorates expect to produce Best Practice Guidelines in Numeracy Provision at Post-Primary Level early in 2015.</p></reply>

My Department is satisfied that the matter is receiving attention at the highest level in Bus Eireann. The Company has advised my Department that the investigation into the allegations referred to by the Deputy is currently ongoing and is expected to conclude in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  This level of expenditure includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs), over 10,700 Learning Support and Resource Teachers along with 740 Special Classes attached to mainstream schools and ensures that as many children as possible can be educated with their peers in mainstream education, in accordance with the intent of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>  The NCSE recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs. As suggested in the report, I have requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new allocation model for teaching supports based on the profiled needs of children in schools.</p></reply>

At this stage all Public Service unions, with the exception of ASTI have accepted the terms of this Agreement.  The position now is that ASTI members have not accepted the Agreement and are not operating the changes to the supervision and substitution scheme provided for in the Agreement that the other teacher unions are operating.  Given that position I have indicated, as has my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the continued payment of the supervision and substitution allowance to ASTI members is unsustainable.</p><p>  We have provided time and space for the recent discussions between officials from my Department and the ASTI in a final effort to resolve this issue, and it is now a matter for the membership of the ASTI to make their decision in relation to the outcome of those discussions.  However, I would be less than frank if I did not make the point to the House that the payment of the supervision and substitution allowance cannot be continued.</p><p>  It is now a matter for the membership of the ASTI to make their decision in relation to the outcome of those discussions. I would like to take this opportunity to restate the significant benefits which will accrue to ASTI members if they accept the Haddington Road Agreement. These include:</p><p> - Improved levels of payment for newly qualified teachers</p><p> - A review of the usage of the 33 additional hours required by teachers under Croke Park</p><p> - A firm timetable on the establishment of an expert group to examine casualisation in the teaching profession</p><p> - The introduction of additional assistant principal posts to support the management of schools.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the ASTI have agreed to re-ballot their members on the Haddington Road Agreement, and I hope that ASTI members will accept the benefits of the Agreement.</p></reply>

The first is by putting in place a collective agreement.  This occurred in the case of TUI and INTO, as a consequence of which their members have available to them the various Government commitments under the Haddington Road Agreement, in particular the continuing payment of increments and improved pay scales.  As ASTI has not to date accepted the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement, its members have a freeze on the payment of increments and improved pay scales are not available to them.</p><p>  Alternatively, it is open to the Government to unilaterally change the terms of the Supervision and Substitution scheme as it is empowered to do by the Financial Emergency Measures legislation.  To date, the Government has not exercised this option in the case of ASTI members.  However, I have previously indicated, as has my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the continued payment of the supervision and substitution allowance to ASTI members is unsustainable.</p><p>  We have provided time and space for the recent discussions between officials from my Department and the ASTI in a final effort to resolve this issue, and it is now a matter for the membership of the ASTI to make their decision in relation to the outcome of those discussions.  However, I would be less than frank if I did not make the point to the House that the payment of the supervision and substitution allowance cannot be continued.</p><p>  It is now a matter for the membership of the ASTI to make their decision in relation to the outcome of those discussions.  I would like to take this opportunity to restate the significant benefits which will accrue to ASTI members if they accept the Haddington Road Agreement. These include:</p><p>- Improved levels of payment for newly qualified teachers</p><p>- A review of the usage of the 33 additional hours required by teachers under Croke Park</p><p>- A firm timetable on the establishment of an expert group to examine casualisation in the teaching profession</p><p>- The introduction of additional assistant principal posts to support the management of schools.</p><p>  I welcome the fact that the ASTI have agreed to re-ballot their members on the Haddington Road Agreement, and I hope that ASTI members will accept the benefits of the Agreement. </p></reply>

I was accompanied by the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton TD.  The event was organised by President Hollande to maintain political momentum behind addressing the youth employment challenge, particularly in terms of identifying concrete actions to implement the Youth Guarantee.  It followed a similar event organised by Chancellor Merkel that took place in Berlin in July.  </p><p>  This is one of the most pressing issues we face in Europe today.  That is why the June European Council agreed that all efforts must be mobilised around the shared objective of getting young people into education, training or employment.  Over 20 Heads of State or Government gathered in Paris to take this agenda forward with the support of relevant Ministers.  We know that young people who become long term unemployed are at greatest risk of becoming permanently disengaged from the workforce. Unless we address this problem, Europe will suffer the economic and social consequences long after this downturn ends.  My own contribution focused on digital skills and the potential of the digital economy generally, including in light of the recent Dublin Web Summit.</p><p>  The October European Council highlighted that  Europe could have as many as 900,000 unfilled ICT vacancies by 2015.  Improving the pipeline of digital skills therefore makes sense for both youth and the EU economy.  It will kick start young careers, it will spawn new fast growing tech companies, and it will improve the competitiveness of our existing SMEs.</p><p>  Our discussions in Paris isolated three clear priorities which were highlighted by President Hollande in his concluding remarks.  First is education and training.  We must step up our efforts to prepare our young people for the jobs of the future and to equip them with the right qualifications.  Second is labour market integration.  This means a particular focus on those of our youth who are at greatest risk of marginalisation and long term unemployment.  Third is supporting the creation of new firms and youth entrepreneurships.  We do this by making it as easy as possible to set up a business and to finance the most promising new ideas.  We must also mobilise all available instruments to implement these priorities, including through the &euro;6 billion Youth Employment Initiative agreed as part of the new Multiannual Financial Framework, frontloaded in 2014-15.</p><p>  I confirmed in Paris that the first phase of our own Youth Guarantee implementation plan will be ready before the end of this year, as provided for in Pathways to Work 2013.  This work is being led by the Minister for Social Protection and supported by the OECD.</p></reply>

The objectives of my Department&rsquo;s approach to language training are: to equip diplomatic officers with the language skills necessary to carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively, to encourage general service staff who do not have a requirement to serve abroad to develop their language skills as part of their overall career development, and to develop the Irish language skills of staff so as to enable the Department to provide high quality services through Irish to the public and comply with the provisions of the Official Languages Act. </p><p>  Due to the range of issues involved, it is not possible in the time available to provide the information which the Deputy has requested in tabular form from March 2011. Staff of my Department engage in language tuition using a variety of methods which are funded by my Department, including: in-house lunchtime classes, evening classes at the various language institutes undertaken in their own time, on-line courses, self-learning materials (e.g. CDs), degree courses in receipt of Refund of Fees, intensive tuition and immersion courses. Many would also have attended classes at the Civil Service Language Centre, which, as the Deputy will be aware, has now ceased to operate. The method of delivery selected in each case depends on a variety of factors including initial skill level, level required for the conduct of their duties, professional development needs and whether they are going on posting abroad, where a particular priority is accorded.</p><p>  With regard to individual qualifications, in some cases, staff will be acquiring a language from beginner level and in other cases they will be improving or maintaining existing language skills. While a language qualification is not a requirement for entry, ability to work in a major foreign language such as French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Arabic or Russian is a distinct advantage. After recruitment, all diplomatic staff are expected to develop their language skills and are supported in this by the Training &amp;amp; Development Unit. I can advise the Deputy that tuition across the spectrum of languages is undertaken by the diplomatic staff in my Department in the course of their careers and that in-house lunchtime classes in Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, French, German and Irish are currently provided on a weekly basis and are open to all members of staff.</p><p>  The annual Training &amp;amp; Development Budget for my Department is normally in the region of &euro;500,000 and, within that budget, approximately &euro;180,000 is usually allocated to the provision of language training for my staff, across the range of deliveries referred to earlier. The level of this investment reflects the high priority which my Department attaches to the development and maintenance of language skills. </p><p>  I can also assure the Deputy that language training is a key element of the Pre-Post Training process and that new entrants at graduate/Third Secretary level joining my Department early next year who do not have a good working knowledge of a foreign language will be expected to acquire such knowledge.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-26a.112.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112600056#WRC01200"><p>The aims of the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership are to provide a coherent framework for cooperation with the six countries in the EU&rsquo;s Eastern neighbourhood: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Ireland supports the aims of the Eastern Partnership and looks forward to the Summit as a significant step forward in the EU&rsquo;s relationship with these countries. I am convinced that Association Agreements have the potential to build an area of prosperity and stability in the EU&rsquo;s Eastern neighbourhood, within the framework of the rule of law and supported by democratic values.  They can contribute to the security and prosperity, not only of the Eastern Partners, but also of the EU and its Member States, including Ireland.</p><p>  All six Eastern Partner countries will be present at the Summit. This will include Belarus where, regrettably, the situation with regard to human rights and democratic standards leaves it unable to conclude an Association Agreement with the EU. The presence of Belarus at the Summit will allow the EU to send clear messages to the Belarus authorities regarding our concerns on the human rights situation there.  With regard to Ukraine, President Yanukovych has announced that they will suspend the preparations to sign their Association Agreement with the EU at the Vilnius Summit. While disappointed, Ireland would nevertheless hope that Ukraine will continue on the path of reform and believes that Ukraine&rsquo;s future lies in a strong relationship with the EU. </p><p>  The conditionality for Ukraine to sign its Association Agreement with the EU, set down by the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2012, includes addressing the issue of selective justice. The most prominent example of this is the conviction and ongoing detention of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko. In that connection, I would refer the Deputy to my statement to this House on 19 November in which I set out Ireland&rsquo;s position and the actions which I have taken in relation to this important matter.</p><p>  As I stated last week, I support the appeal of the former President of Poland Aleksander Kwa&oelig;niewski, and the former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, to the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, to release Ms Tymoshenko for medical treatment on health and humanitarian grounds by way of pardon. This continues to be my position.</p></reply>

The focus of the Emigrant Support Programme is on initiatives that: address the needs of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable Irish emigrants; enhance access for Irish emigrants and Irish community organisations to local statutory and voluntary services; foster a more vibrant sense of community and Irish identity amongst the Irish abroad; and encourage closer links between Irish communities abroad and Ireland, to the benefit of both. In addition, since 2009, the Programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical results orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, and projects that emerged as a consequence of the Global Irish Economic Forum and its follow up.   A list of payments made, to date, in 2013 is below. Payments in respect of a number of approved grants is currently being processed and I would be happy to provide the Deputy with a complete list of 2013 grants following the end of the financial year.

Our missions abroad work very closely with the state agencies in the promotion of exports, tourism and inward investment. They provide frontline consular and passport services to citizens overseas, engaging with and supporting Irish communities overseas. They perform also a wide range of functions in support of Ireland&rsquo;s wider foreign policy interests. These include representing and advancing government policies, in particular in the context of the European Union and at the United Nations, economic and cultural promotion, and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overseas diplomatic network includes 56 Embassies, 7 multilateral missions and 10 Consulates General and other offices. In addition to their country of residence, many Ambassadors are accredited concurrently to additional countries which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation. The scale and deployment of our diplomatic network is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis to ensure that it most effectively meets Ireland&rsquo;s current needs, consistent with the resources available.</p></reply>

Following a comprehensive job analysis, the key competencies required for Third Secretary were identified and appropriate tests selected to evaluate those skills. The assessment tools and techniques being used this year are similar to those employed at previous Third Secretary competitions i.e. reasoning tests and a job simulation exercise. The initial stage of the current selection process was by way of online reasoning tests. Those who achieved the highest scores have been invited to an assessment centre where they will undergo further assessments including reasoning tests and a job simulation exercise. Those successful at that stage may subsequently be invited to attend for interview.   As regards candidates with special requirements, PAS has an exemplary record in such matters.

Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral aid programme to Mozambique is governed by a five year country strategy (2012&ndash;16).  The goal of the programme is to support sustainable, inclusive, development, and to contribute to the reduction of poverty and vulnerability in Mozambique.  Under this strategy, Ireland has committed to working with a range of partners to deliver our assistance, including the Government of Mozambique, international institutions, non-governmental organisations, civil society and research bodies.  The attached table provides the breakdown of Ireland&rsquo;s support to Mozambique.</p><p>  Ireland cooperates with other donors in providing support to the Government of Mozambique through a number of different funding channels: general budget support, the education common fund, the land fund for agriculture, and &ndash; in a partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative &ndash; the health common fund.  In 2012, approximately 80% of Irish bilateral assistance to Mozambique was delivered through Government systems.  An important objective is to support the development of key public services and to strengthen the capacity of the administration to deliver these services to Mozambican citizens. </p><p>  Funds delivered through Mozambican Government systems are subject to a series of checks.  The Mozambican Government makes available to donors the full details of its budget, including its quarterly and annual financial execution reports, six-monthly progress reports and all audit reports.  This includes State accounts audited by Mozambique&rsquo;s supreme audit institution, the Tribunal Administrativo.  In addition, donors, including Ireland, supplement the work of the Tribunal Administrativo through the use of commercial audit companies and through Public Financial Management reviews.  </p><p>  The Mozambican Parliament&rsquo;s Planning and Budget Committee &ndash; which is chaired by the Honourable Eneas Comiche, who visited the Oireachtas last June &ndash; has oversight of the State budget, which is a mix of Mozambique&rsquo;s own revenues and pooled international development funds.  It also reviews audit reports from the Tribunal Administrativo on Government spending.  </p><p>  While Mozambique&rsquo;s economy is growing fast, it still remains poor. Mozambique currently ranks 185 out of 187 countries in the UN Human Development Index.  Over recent years, after a terrible civil war, with support from Ireland and other donors, Mozambique has made excellent progress to improve health outcomes, particularly for pregnant women and babies, and to increase the number of children attending primary school.  However, considerable challenges remain, including high rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  While the numbers of children in school have increased, the Government recognises that more must be done to improve the quality of education.  <table><tr><th><div><b>Area</b></div></th><th><div><b>Description</b></div></th><th><div>Amount - &euro;</div></th></tr><tr><td><b>General Budget Support</b></td><td>This support is provided to the Government of Mozambique to implement the national Poverty Reduction Strategy, enhance service delivery across all public services and implement public financial management reforms.</td><td><div>9,000,000</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Programme Support Costs</td><td><div>23,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Health &amp;amp; HIV/AIDS</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)</td><td>Health Sector Basket Fund &ndash; Ministry of Health and Clinton Foundation</td><td><div>13,500,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>CHAI</td><td>Clinton Foundation - Support for the provision of technical support to the Ministry of Health, including on drug procurement and the roll-out of health technology</td><td><div>200,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Helen Keller International</td><td>To support nutrition response and efforts to ensure the passing of mandatory legislation on food fortification</td><td><div>200,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>International Potato Centre (CIP)</td><td>Orange Flesh Sweet Potato Programme in Niassa Province</td><td><div>250,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Provincial Directorate Of Health</td><td>Focus on Community Health in Niassa and Inhambane</td><td><div>450,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>International Relief and Development</td><td>Community Health and focus on HIV/AIDS</td><td><div>535<font face="Times New Roman">,000</font></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Programme Support Costs</td><td><div>88<font face="Times New Roman">,000</font></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>15,223,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Education</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Education Common Fund</td><td>Education Sector Common Fund  </td><td><div>5,000,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Niassa Provincial Education </td><td>Education Sector Support</td><td><div>550,000</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Programme Support Costs</td><td><div>43,000</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>5,593,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Agriculture</b></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Technoserve</td><td>Agri-business - building a regional horticulture cluster in Inhambane Province</td><td><div>692,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Land Fund</td><td>Improving Certification of Land for Communities</td><td><div>200,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>UNICEF</td><td>Support for Social Protection</td><td><div>250,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Swedish Cooperative Centre</td><td>Strengthening Civil Society Organisations Capacity to Advocate for Natural Resource Issues</td><td><div>200,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Provincial Directorate of Planning and Finance</td><td>Enhancing Public Financial Management Systems in Inhambane and Niassa Provinces</td><td><div>400,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">-</font></td><td>Programme Support Costs</td><td><div>39,788</div></td></tr><tr><td><font face="Times New Roman">-</font></td><td>Total</td><td><div>1,781,788</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The late Judge Henry Barron and Patrick McEntee SC carried out detailed and painstaking inquiries into bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 and, indeed, other atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many people lost their lives. The Garda authorities co-operated fully with the Barron and McEntee inquiries.

I am further advised that Sheriffs are Officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended. The Sheriffs are independent of both the Minister for Finance and Revenue in the application of these functions.</p><p>  Once a certificate relating to an unpaid tax debt has been issued to a Sheriff, the taxpayer becomes liable for payment of the associated costs and fees. The current fees structure is set out in the Sheriffs Fees and Expenses Order, 2005 (S.I. No. 655/2005) which was made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Finance and came into effect on 1 November 2005. The fees are as follows:</p><p>-   <b><i>Lodgment fee of &euro;19</i></b></p><p>-   <b><i>Poundage 5% for the first &euro;5,500 and 2.5% of balance</i></b></p><p>-   <b><i>Travelling expenses of &euro;32 for the execution of a warrant</i></b></p><p>-   <b><i>&euro;40 payable on execution of a warrant</i></b></p><p>-   <b><i>Any necessary expenses incurred in relation to seizure and sale of goods.</i></b></p><p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed to me that the Sheriffs have a Code of Practice in place, which is available from any of their offices or via the Revenue website, that sets out how they should engage with taxpayers. For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized a written inventory is supplied to the taxpayer followed by an account of proceeds once the goods are sold. The Code also sets out the process through which a taxpayer can make a complaint against a Sheriff.</p><p>  A copy of the Code follows for the Deputy&rsquo;s information.</p><p><b><i>Sheriff&rsquo;s Code of Practice</i></b></p><p>  The following is the Code of Practice operated by the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in relation to dealings with taxpayers:</p><p><b>1. </b><b><i>The Sheriff will</i></b></p><p>  - Treat every taxpayer with courtesy;</p><p>  - Where practicable, notify the taxpayer in writing of the lodgment of a certificate in the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office;</p><p>  - Where requested, explain to the taxpayer the purpose of the visit of the Sheriff, Bailiff  or other staff;</p><p>  - When goods are seized, issue as soon as possible, a written inventory to the taxpayer;</p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with a receipt for monies paid;</p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.</p><p><b>2. </b><b><i>In return the Sheriff expects that the Taxpayer will</i></b></p><p>  - Pay liabilities to the Sheriff on demand;</p><p>  - Be prompt in his/her dealings with the Sheriff&rsquo;s office;</p><p>  - Treat the Sheriff and his staff with courtesy.</p><p><b>3. </b><b><i>Complaints</i></b></p><p>  - If the taxpayer feels aggrieved at the way in which his/her case is handled, complain in writing to the Sheriff&rsquo;s office;</p><p>  - The Sheriff shall investigate any such complaint and respond as promptly as is practicable in the circumstances;</p><p>  - Should the taxpayer remain aggrieved at the Sheriff&rsquo;s response, he/she may refer the complaint to the Revenue Commissioners in writing. The Revenue Commissioners will examine any such complaint and may request that the Sheriff undertake a review.</p><p>  - Should the taxpayer remain aggrieved at the outcome of the Sheriff&rsquo;s review, the complaint may at his/her request be referred to the Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of  the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs&rsquo; Association. The JSC will review the issue(s)by means of an examination of all the relevant correspondence and documentation. [The JSC is made up of an equal number of representatives from the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs Association, with a neutral Chairman.]</p><p>  - Where a complaint involves an allegation of criminal behaviour against a sheriff, his agents, or staff, then the Joint Standing Committee shall decline to deal with it.</p><p>  - The referral of any matter to the Joint Standing Committee is not in any way to be taken as a diminution or a substitution for a taxpayer&rsquo;s common law rights, which are not interfered with by availing of the said process.</p></reply>

The matter of the 1 November liability date has been raised and responded to several occasions in the House previously and, as far back as 27 March this year, in a reply to Question No. 110 on that date, I specifically addressed the fact that where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.  </p><p>  I have also informed the House in my replies to Questions Nos. 221 [49518/13] and 223 [49556/13] on 19 November 2013 that having a liability date before the year commences is preferable as there is certainty about who the liable person is for the coming year, that person has a reasonable amount of time to make the necessary provisions and they have access to the widest possible range of options for paying the tax.  In particular, the liable person can put the required arrangements in place to ensure that phased payments by way of direct debit or deduction at source from employment, occupational pension or from certain Government payments would commence from January 2014 and would spread payment of the full LPT liability evenly over the course of 2014.</p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, the legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i> since last August.</p><p>  As to whether an anomaly has been created when a property is sold between the liability date and the date that the tax is due, an individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.</p><p>  Finally, the liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled and has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the provision in question.</p></reply>

When assessing the potential impact on the economy of such a measure, my Department must weigh the short-term benefits on economic output against the impact on the public finances. In this regard research produced by the ESRI as part of its Medium-Term Review of July 2013 (pg. 117-118) is informative. Using the HERMES macroeconomic model, the ESRI tested the economic impact of a series of fiscal shocks to the economy. It includes simulations of the impact of a &euro;1 billion adjustment in income tax, which is economically similar to the USC.  The results of the research suggest an income tax multiplier of -0.6, that is, a &euro;1 billion reduction in income tax results in additional GDP of about &euro;600m million over the forecast horizon. Employment would be impacted positively by about 0.5 per cent. </p><p>  The relatively low GDP multiplier likely reflects the open nature of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and the fact that increased demand would &lsquo;leak out&rsquo; through imports. The simulations also include the assumption that some part of a reduced tax burden would be saved rather than spent by households. This positive impact on output must be balanced against the impact on the public finances exerted through lower tax revenues. The simulations suggest that the deficit would increase by 0.5 percentage points of GDP and general government debt by just over 2 per cent of GDP, both by the end of the forecast horizon.</p><p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s current fiscal position, we must necessarily ask if such a measure would be prudent and whether it could be sustained over the medium-term. Through the fiscal adjustment measures that the Government has implemented, stability has been restored to the public finances, the economy is growing and data from the second quarter of the year show jobs being created in the last four quarters. Irish sovereign yields are now at about 3&frac12; per cent, a fraction of the highs of over 14 per cent reached in summer 2011. The improvement in yields is due in large part to the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy which has seen consistent deficit reduction. A reduced cost of borrowing for the Government reduces the interest bill which has to be paid by the taxpayer.</p></reply>

The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment, but, ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial matter for the management and the Board of the Institution. At the same time, the Board must ensure that the day to day running of these institutions has regard to competition, market conditions and the need to develop stable commercial enterprises to meet the long term credit needs of households and businesses.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework with the banks provides that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the bank or their management decisions. These frameworks are published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure their value as assets to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  It must be remembered that in order to fund mortgages, the banks must borrow at current deposit and wholesale rates, which are currently much higher than the ECB base rate. The banks must also ensure that the rates they lend at are economically sustainable and provide a return for the bank and ultimately the State in its capacity as a shareholder.</p></reply>

However, certain types of deposits are excluded from coverage, such as deposits from large companies and inter-bank deposits.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s website has complete information on the Deposit Guarantee Scheme, including information on the types of accounts which are and are not covered by the scheme.  This is available at <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>  All deposit-taking credit institutions in Ireland are required by law to participate in the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. Each credit institution covered by the DGS is required to maintain a balance in the Deposit Protection Account (DPA) equivalent to 0.2% of their total deposits in order to fund the DGS. The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the operation of the DGS and is currently working with credit institutions to receive data on exact coverage levels under the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>  The Deputy should note that the DGS does not pay compensation on an account by account basis. Instead, all of a depositor&rsquo;s eligible deposits with a particular credit institution are aggregated and the DGS covers the first &euro;100,000 of this aggregated amount, per depositor, per credit institution. It is therefore possible that the DGS may cover all or part of a particular account depending on the aggregate amount of the individual&rsquo;s eligible deposits with the credit institution concerned.</p><p>  There is currently no requirement for institutions to advise depositors of their coverage under the DGS. However, further changes to the DGS Directive which are currently being negotiated at EU trilogue level include improvements to the information available to account holders.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank publishes quarterly statistics on the level of mortgage arrears. Separately from Central Bank quarterly reports, my Department is now publishing monthly data on primary home mortgage restructures put in place by the six main lenders covered by the Central Bank&rsquo;s MART process. This will place more timely information in the public domain in relation to the progress by the main banks to resolve mortgages in difficulty.  This should greatly assist the objective of placing more information in the public domain regarding the progress being made by banks on mortgage restructures.  </p><p>  The Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears provides an integrated and cohesive package of consumer protection measures for borrowers either facing or in mortgage arrears.  This provides that mortgage lenders should allow for a flexible approach in the handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases and that they should aim at assisting the borrower who is in genuine difficulty as far as possible having regard to the specific circumstances.</p><p>  It reflects the current mortgage arrears situation and seeks to deliver on the following principles, to: </p><p>  - Ensure appropriate resolution of each borrower&rsquo;s arrears situation; </p><p>  - Ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner; </p><p>  - Support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and </p><p>  - Ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of co-operating with their lender, and the consequences of not co-operating. </p><p>  The Code places particular requirements on lenders, when communicating with customers, to ensure that:</p><p>  - The level of communication is proportionate and not excessive;</p><p>  - Communications are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing;</p><p>  - Borrowers are given sufficient time to complete an action they have committed to before follow-up communication is attempted;</p><p>  - Steps are taken to agree future communication with borrowers.</p><p>  A lender must also produce and implement a Board approved policy regarding communications with borrowers to ensure that these requirements are met.  If a borrower is not satisfied with a lender&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements of the Code, or with the lender&rsquo;s treatment of the borrower&rsquo;s case, then any complaint by the customer must be dealt with in accordance with the complaints provisioning set out in the Consumer Protection Code.  The Central Bank has informed me that it is committed to the on-going monitoring of lenders&rsquo; compliance with the Code and will closely monitor its implementation by lenders.</p></reply>

Permanent TSB are not a participating institution in NAMA, and indeed would have very limited lending to the SME sector compared to AIB and Bank of Ireland. Following the publication of an assessment of the CRO carried out by Grant Thornton, I engaged in a public consultation process in order to see what more the CRO can do to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require. As a first step, I sanctioned an increase in the numbers on the Credit Review Panel in order to facilitate faster processing of decisions, thereby implementing one of the recommendations in the assessment. In addition, in Budget 2014 I increased the threshold by which SMEs can appeal refusals from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million. This will facilitate requests from a broader range of SMEs as well as large requests for refinancing.</p><p>  The recent CRO report shows that the Credit Review Office upheld the credit appeal in 150 cases or 55% of cases decided. The upheld appeals have resulted in &euro;18.5 million in credit being made available to SMEs and farms, protecting 1,521 jobs and I would strongly encourage SMEs refused credit to seek a review by the Office.  My officials and I continue to liaise with the banks on a regular basis and the decision as to whether to amend the remit of the CRO to include non-NAMA participating banks remains under review.</p></reply>

It is hard to see in any context how the purchase of a bank which has been focussed on downsizing over the past number of years would match the goals and ambition of strategic investment.    As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF). </p><p>  Using the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, we will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  Officials of my Department are currently preparing the necessary legislation which I anticipate will be enacted early next year. </p><p>  Already, in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support both strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.  Further assessment of the need to create a Strategic Investment Bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government&rsquo;s key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.</p></reply>

Solid fuel is defined under section 77 of the Finance Act 2010, as amended and means coal or peat.  Coal is further defined to include coal and lignite, solid fuel manufactured from coal and lignite, and any other energy product within the meaning of Article 2.1 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 in solid form.  Peat means peat falling within CN Code 2703 of the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2658/87 of 23 July 1987, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2031/2001 of 6 August 2001 and includes any solid fuel manufactured from peat.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels)(Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 270 of 2011), made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, specifies the standards for coal placed on the market and extends the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State. Under the Regulations, all coal suppliers are obliged to register with the Environmental Protection Agency and comply with sulphur content and packaging standards. In particular, the sulphur content of coal that may be sold in the State, which is not more than 0.7% sulphur by weight, is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations will be enforced by the Local Authorities.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of carbon tax on solid fuels, also advise me that on commencement of the carbon tax provisions under the Finance Act 2010, any Northern Ireland-based wholesaler of solid fuels selling into the market in Ireland will be obliged to register as a supplier and comply with the same regulatory requirements as wholesalers based in the State. Such suppliers will be obliged to make returns on solid fuels supplied in the State in the accounting period concerned and pay the amount of carbon tax due in respect of that supply.  Therefore it is not my intention to defer the second phase of the carbon tax which is due for implementation in May 2014.</p></reply>

I am, however, introducing an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%. This additional levy within the existing legal framework will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. I am doing this to continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate detailed below and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated or set aside to meet any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>. One of the very significant and successful measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> &ndash; the reduced VAT rate of 9% on tourism and certain other services &ndash; was due to end this year. In my Budget speech, I announced the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate. I also announced that the Air Travel Tax is being reduced to zero with effect from 1 April 2014. The combined cost of these initiatives is estimated at close to &euro;400 million in a full year.</p><p>  The extent of the potential State liabilities from the pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties is a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. However, I can say that agreement has been secured for these liabilities to be met by the Exchequer, where they arise. As I have already indicated, however, the proceeds from the levy that accrue to the Exchequer are not set aside in the manner suggested in the question and expenditure decisions on the use of those and other funds will be made as they arise in the normal way.</p></reply>

This particular scam took the form of a message referring to an Irish tax refund. Recipients were invited to visit a website and to enter the 4 digit number contained in the message. Recipients who followed the instructions were then asked to provide certain information including their bank account and credit card details.</p><p>  Immediately on becoming aware on this matter, Revenue placed a warning notification on the home page of their website (www.revenue.ie) - this warning is still on the website. The notification confirms that the text message in question is not from Revenue and reminds customers that Revenue never sends unsolicited text messages. It further instructs recipients to ignore such messages and advises those who might have provided personal information to contact their bank or credit card company immediately. Revenue used social media to draw attention to this matter and there was coverage of the matter in national and local media. Revenue also contacted the Internet Service Provider hosting the website referred to in the text message and requested that it be closed down. It should be noted that this particular scam has already crossed six different websites in three different countries.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that there is no connection between the receipt of this fraudulent text message and contact of any manner a person may have made with Revenue in the past. The perpetrators of the text message scam sourced mobile telephone numbers from a source or sources unknown and issued texts in the hope that a percentage of recipients would reply and provide personal information of the type outlined. In that context also the Deputy should be aware that the &lsquo;Security&rsquo; section of Revenue&rsquo;s website carries warnings about fraudulent emails and text messages.</p><p>  Finally, the security of their systems and customer information is a priority for Revenue.

The MTES is a whole-of-Government endeavour and the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were given joint responsibility to prepare the strategy in close consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the T&aacute;naiste, and working with all Departments.  The strategy will set out the macroeconomic strategy and policy actions for achieving sustainable economic and employment growth for the period 2014-2020.   Extensive consultation with a range of key stakeholders has already taken place.  Two consultation exercises in relation to the MTES were undertaken by the two Departments in September 2013 which focused on the challenges to be addressed to achieve economic growth and job creation.  The first of these was a conference in Dublin Castle on 3rd September under the auspices of the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service (IGEES) which, inter alia, supports Departments in evaluating policy and providing economic analysis. The IGEES event was attended by representatives of government Departments and agencies, regulators, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI), the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and academia. </p><p>  In addition, a major consultative forum took place on Tuesday 24th September 2013, again in Dublin Castle, at which around 160 representatives of businesses and enterprises, relevant Government Departments and agencies and bodies representative of business and industry participated. This forum facilitated the exchange of ideas between Government and business with a view to Ireland maximising economic growth and meeting its fiscal commitments to the year 2020 and is helping to inform the preparation of the MTES.  On 18th October Officials from my Department also briefed members of the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) on the MTES preparations.  In a document titled, <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Five-Part Crisis, Five Years On: Driving Reform and Institutional Innovation, </i>  NESC raised a number of issues in respect of the MTES regarding the policy-making framework, including how policy is developed, implemented and reviewed for effectiveness. </p><p>  A further MTES consultative event was held on 25th November to capture the input of a more diverse group of entrepreneurs, specifically: female entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs (mainly under 35 years of age) and &lsquo;new Irish&rsquo; entrepreneurs.  The views and ideas expressed at this event will also be taken into consideration in   drafting the MTES.</p><p>  In addition, following competitive tendering processes, we engaged the services of two consultancy firms.  </p><p>  1. The ESRI was engaged to advise and assist in the economic modelling of various policy scenarios; </p><p>  2. PMCA Economic Consultants were engaged to provide assistance and analysis in the preparation of the Medium-Term Economic Strategy, including an analysis of recent medium-term economic strategies in countries  comparable to Ireland, and to provide related advice on the effective development and implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>  We are also receiving advice and assistance from PIVOT Dublin in the design of the final document.  A publication date for the Strategy has not been decided by Government as yet, but it is intended to produce at least a clear outline of the strategy by mid-December.</p></reply>

The position is that section 462 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a claimant must prove for a year of assessment that a qualifying child was resident with the claimant for the whole or part of the year. That qualifying child must be either a child of the claimant or, if this is not the case, the claimant must have custody of the child and maintain that child at his or her own expense.  Therefore, depending on the particular domestic circumstances pertaining to a child, more than one claimant may claim a credit in respect of the same child.

The development of the Property Register required Revenue to extract and consolidate data from multiple Government and non-Government sources.  During this process duplicate records were added to the Register in some circumstances, mainly due to differences in address records.  Revenue emphasised during its communications programme that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task.

The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) database and data from utility companies.  I am advised by Revenue that data from the various sources was cross-checked to ensure that the Local Property Tax (LPT) Register was as accurate as possible prior the issue of correspondence to property owners earlier this year.  Revenue compared property address details in one database with the address details in other databases and used data matching software to assist in the matching process.  Given the tight timeframes involved in developing the LPT Register, it was not considered practical to attempt to use software to match the addresses rendered in English and Irish, either in their entirety or in part.  These addresses would therefore have been recorded on the LPT Register as separate property addresses.  I am advised by the Commissioners that they are not able to quantify the number of cases where a duplicate address on the LPT Register was caused by an Irish and English equivalent of the same address, but I am assured that very few cases were involved.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in their public communications campaign, the Commissioners sought to forewarn property owners about potential errors in property details recorded on the LPT Register and provided clear guidance on the steps that should be taken by owners in these cases.  In addition, the Revenue website advised property owners who received a duplicate LPT Return for their property to contact Revenue in writing, providing details of the duplicate property, in order to ensure that it was removed from the LPT Register and that any LPT charge associated with the duplicate property was cancelled.  I am further advised that some individuals who received duplicate LPT Returns have already contacted Revenue and the Register has been updated accordingly.  Work is ongoing to refine the Register and this will include the removal of any further duplicate properties that are identified.</p></reply>

Finance Act 2012 provides that Investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowances beyond the tax life of the particular scheme where that tax life ends after 1 January 2015.  Where the tax life of a scheme has ended before 1 January 2015 no carry forward of allowances into 2015 will be allowed.  This delayed implementation is designed to give individuals sufficient time to adjust to the absence of the carry forward provision.</p><p>  In addition, mortgage interest relief for <i>principal private residences </i>will no longer be available to house purchasers who purchase after the end of 2012 and will be fully abolished from 2018.  Looking to the future, the existing scheme for film relief will be abolished from 1 January 2015 and replaced by a new &ldquo;credits&rdquo; scheme aimed at the film producers rather than passive investors.  Also from 2015 consanguinity relief for transfers of non-residential property will be abolished.</p><p>  The reliefs that were abolished in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to date are set out in the following table along with the estimated annual Exchequer saving, where available:<table><tr><th>2011</th><th>Measures</th><th>Full year saving &euro;m (estimated)</th></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>BIK (Benefit-in-kind) exemption on certain professional subscriptions               </td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Patent Royalty Exemption </td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Investment allowance for machinery and plant and for exploration expenditure </td><td>&amp;lt;1</td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>Stamp Duty:  farm consolidation relief</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>Measures</td><td>Full year saving &euro;m (estimated)</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Illness benefit &ndash; removal of the 36 day exemption for illness benefit. </td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Stamp Duty:<br /><br />Abolition of stamp duty exemption for low value non-residential properties (below &euro;10,000 in value) </td><td>Specific figure unavailable</td></tr><tr><td>2013 to date</td><td>Measures</td><td>Full year saving &euro;m (estimated)</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Maternity Benefit &ndash; removal of the tax exemption in respect of maternity benefit payments from 1 July 2013. </td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Top slicing relief - was abolished from 1 January 2013 in respect of ex-gratia discretionary termination lump sum payments where the non-statutory payment was &euro;200,000 or over. </td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>- </td><td>USC &ndash; the concessionary rate of USC  which apply to those 1) aged 70 and over and 2) to those in receipt of medical card was removed were they had income in excess of &euro;60, 000 per annum</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Abolition of exemption from DIRT and income tax of certain interest paid on Special Term Accounts</td><td>Specific figure unavailable</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Ceilings of &euro;1,000 per adult and &euro;500 per child were introduced for tax relief on Medical Insurance Premiums from 16 October 2013.

The amount due by apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology during the academic year.  This is typically one third of the Annual Student Contribution (&euro;2,500 for academic year 2013/2014) paid by students attending for the full academic year but it can be greater for certain trades where longer periods are spent in Institutes of Technology.</p><p>  Since 2004, F&Aacute;S/SOLAS has paid a part of the Annual Student Contribution due in respect of apprentices, with apprentices themselves paying the part of the contribution relating to examination fees.  As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS will cease making payments to Institutes of Technology and apprentices will pay the pro rata Annual Student Contribution.  Apprentices are paid a training allowances by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in Institutes of Technology.  This allowance is equivalent to the wages they receive from their employers for on the job phases and this is unaffected by the budgetary changes.</p></reply>

It is particularly significant that the terms of the Haddington Road Agreement are more favourable for virtually all teachers than those of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  This is particularly true in the case of new entrant teachers.</p><p>  The context of the Haddington Road Agreement was the need to address the major and unprecedented financial difficulties facing the State.  At this stage all Public Service unions, with the exception of ASTI have accepted the terms of this Agreement.  We are now in a situation in which ASTI members have not accepted the Agreement and are not operating the changes to the supervision and substitution scheme provided for in the Agreement that the other teacher unions are operating.  Given that situation, I have indicated, as has my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the continued payment of the supervision and substitution allowance to ASTI members is unsustainable.</p><p>  We have provided time and space for the recent discussions between officials from my Department and the ASTI in a final effort to resolve this issue, and it is now a matter for the membership of the ASTI to make their decision in relation to the outcome of those discussions.  However, I would be less than frank if I did not make the point that the payment of the supervision and substitution allowance cannot be continued.</p></reply>

The development of a new integrated language curriculum at primary level is well advanced.  This curriculum will include learning outcomes specific to the language learning needs of pupils that learn through Irish, including those in Gaeltacht schools.  Work has also commenced on the development of a new specification for Irish at Junior Cycle.  Consideration is also being given to the development of a specialised short course in Irish for use in Irish medium schools as part of the new Junior Cycle.</p><p>  An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has greatly improved the range of educational resources and materials available for teaching through Irish.  The co-location of COGG with the NCCA will enhance COGG's capacity in this work by enabling the development of curriculum by the NCCA and materials in Irish in COGG to take place in a closely co-ordinated way.  The Department of Education and Skills is also undertaking a comprehensive review of education provided in the Gaeltacht.  This review will take account of the particular challenges with regard to teaching through Irish in Gaeltacht schools and the planning provisions in the Gaeltacht Act 2013.  The purpose of the review is to identify options for the delivery of education in Gaeltacht primary schools and post-primary schools of various linguistic profiles, and to clarify expectations and policy with regard to teaching through Irish in such schools.  Arising from the review, it is expected that a range of policy options for the provision of education in Gaeltacht schools will be provided and that any additional supports required in the future will be identified.</p><p>  T&aacute; raon beartas ar bun de r&eacute;ir forfheidhmi&uacute; na Strait&eacute;ise Fiche Bliain chun tac&uacute; leis na scoileanna Gaeltachta.

My Department is implementing that Action Plan and progress is being made in a number of areas, including divesting of patronage in areas of stable population, inclusiveness in primary education, Education about Religion and Beliefs and Ethics and the provision of Irish medium schools.</p><p>  Surveys of parental preferences regarding patronage were conducted in over 40 areas in the country.  The Catholic Patrons in 28 areas where parental demand for change was confirmed through parental survey outcomes have been contacted and asked to consider options for reconfiguring their schools to allow the transfer of a school to a new patron.  I launched a public consultation on inclusiveness in primary schools in September.  The consultation period ended last Friday, 22 November, and approximately 350 submissions have been received.  The submissions, together with the Forum Report findings and recommendations in this area, will be considered in the preparation of a White Paper which will chart the way forward.</p><p>  I have asked the NCCA to develop a programme on Education about Religion and Beliefs and Ethics.  The inclusive processes of the NCCA will allow an opportunity for all interested parties, including faith and non-faith interests to have their views taken into account inn the development of such programmes.  The Forum Advisory Group made a number of recommendations concerning the provision of Irish medium schools and analysis has begun of the start-up and growth of Irish medium schools as proposed by the Advisory Group.  This analysis will inform future policy development in this area.</p></reply>

This is undertaken through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need rather than that of ethnic or cultural background.</p><p>  Travellers now avail of the following mainstream resources, similar to all other children:</p><p> - Free Pre-school Year</p><p> - School transport</p><p> - Classroom Teacher Allocation at Primary and Post-Primary level</p><p> - Learning Resource Teachers at Primary and Post-Primary Level in the case of identified special educational need</p><p> - Further and adult Education.</p><p>  The cuts to which the Deputy refers are referenced in the recent report published by Pavee Point 'Travelling with Austerity' and refers to reduction in funding for segregated Traveller-specific programmes.  However, no corresponding reference is made to the fact that some of this funding has been redeployed to accommodate Travellers in mainstream programmes.  Nor does the Report take account of overall resources within the education system which are also availed of by Traveller children.  The Traveller Education Advisory and Consultative Forum, which has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Strategy is currently working to a thematic approach to address the core issues of attendance, attainment, and retention of young Travellers in education.  Membership of the Forum includes Traveller representative groups and representatives of the education partners and of relevant policy areas of the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.</p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.</p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours</p><p>Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

Applications were invited from potential patrons for the new school. Following analysis of the expressed parental preferences that formed part of those applications, the New Schools Establishment Group recommended that two new schools should be established to serve the area, each to cater for a single stream of junior infant intake. One of the new schools is an English language medium school under the patronage of Educate Together and the second new school is an Irish language medium school under the patronage of An Foras Patrunachta.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, there is an existing Irish language medium school already located in the general area referred to. The question of location for the new Irish language medium school was therefore considered in the context of providing access to both Irish language medium schools to as great a number of pupils as possible. I should point out that Irish language medium schools (similar to many multi-denominational English medium schools) frequently make the point to my Department that the feeder or catchment areas for their schools tend to be considerably larger than those of the more traditional parish schools. It was logical therefore to locate the two Irish language medium schools at a remove from each other and thus provide the option of an Irish language medium school within a reasonable distance to a greater number of families and pupils in the area. This approach is supported by the patron of the two Irish language medium schools in question and is very much in line with the thrust of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.</p></reply>

All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs. It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services.  All Post Primary schools have also been allocated additional teaching resources for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs.</p><p>  My Department provides guidelines for schools in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with high incidence special educational needs. These include Circular SpEd 02/05, Inclusion of Pupils with Special Educational Needs Post Primary Guidelines and the National Edcuational Psychological Services (NEPS) Continuum of Support Guidelines.  Further resources are also provided to schools to support pupils with SLDs. Funding is provided for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, once relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education.

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  All schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including Specific Learning Disability (SLD), of which dyscalculia is one such Specific Learning Disability. All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs. It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services. All Post Primary schools have also been allocated additional teaching resources for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs.</p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs. The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students. I can also advise the Deputy that students with special educational needs may apply for exemptions from Irish in accordance with the specified criteria provided under my Departments Circular 12/96 for primary schools and Circular M10/94 for post-primary schools. However, for the most part, pupils with special educational needs are accommodated in schools through curriculum differentiation, as opposed to specific subject exemption.</p><p>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils with special needs.  Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have also been designed in such a way to enable teachers to cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The Special Education Support Service (SESS), which is a service under the management of my Department also supports schools and provides additional training for them in supporting students with special educational needs.</p></reply>

My Department recognises that specialised training and continued professional development (CPD) is important for staff working with children with special educational needs and supports the provision of CPD through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was specifically established for this purpose. The SESS co-ordinates and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs.</p><p>  My Department also funds a number of Post-Graduate Programmes for teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education. These programmes are specifically designed to assist all schools and educational services in meeting the needs of students requiring learning support and the teaching of students with special educational needs. Since 2007, some 2,000 teachers have completed these programmes.</p><p>  In relation to initial teacher education, while special education has long been a feature of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes, the Teaching Council, the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers, requires ITE programmes, all of which are currently being reconceptualised and extended, to address a number of specific elements including literacy and numeracy, differentiation and Inclusive Education including Special Education to assist student teachers in meeting the diversity of students in today's inclusive classrooms.</p><p>  It has been the policy of my Department for some time that only qualified and registered teachers should be employed by schools. Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed. Further guidance for schools on the organisation of Learning Support/Resource Teachers posts is provided in my Department's Circular SP ED 02/05: Organisation of Teaching Resources for Pupils who need Additional Support in Mainstream Primary Schools.  In making policy in this area, my Department is informed by a range of sources including the Inspectorate, the NCSE and the Teaching Council. There are no plans to make changes along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where students do not meet the terms of the free fees schemes, including nationality, it is the higher education institutions that determine, in accordance with their own criteria, the rate of tuition fees (EU or non EU) to be paid by students. Whilst this is an issue for the Governing Authority of each Institution, the Government has agreed that certain policy issues need to be clarified. In that regard the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has, at my request, entered into discussions with the sector so as establish and report on the practices currently being pursued in individual institutions in relation to the charging of the EU and non-EU rates of fee and to facilitate the introduction of a consistent policy approach with regards the fee rates to apply to students who do not qualify for free fees.</p><p>  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2013.  In all cases, to qualify for a student grant, it is the grant applicant and not his/her parents that must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in their own right. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as proof of their nationality or immigration status to the relevant grant awarding authority.</p><p>  Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2013 provides for the review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of changes of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a students' nationality or immigration status. This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation or acquires a prescribed immigration status during the course of their studies they may make an application in the academic year for a student grant.</p></reply>

The overall value of the measure for the 2013/14 academic year is &euro;16.2m. The management of the Third Level Access Measure Fund rests with the Higher Education Authority and the allocation of funding for the sub-priorities in a particular year is a matter for the authority.</p><p>  The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in need. The Authority approved in July of this year an allocation for the Student Assistance Fund for the 2013/14 academic year of &euro;8m. Each participating institution was advised of its individual allocation in advance of the academic year in order to facilitate timely planning and disbursement to students.</p><p>  The Fund has increased substantially in recent years, from &euro;5m in 2010-11 to an allocation of &euro;8m in the most recent academic year (2012-13). During the 2012/13 academic year, the Higher Education Authority closely monitored local demand for the Fund around the country. Data collected from participating institutions showed a very substantial increase in demand for the Fund compared with the previous year, the outcome of which was a decision by my Department to allocate an additional &euro;3m for 2012-13 as an exceptional measure, bringing the total allocation for the year to &euro;11m.</p><p>  Final data on the number of beneficiaries for 2012-13 is currently being collected. A total of 13,347 students benefited from the Fund in 2011-12, an increase of over 5,000 students on the previous year. The HEA is continuing to monitor demand for the Fund from participating colleges in relation to 2013-14.</p></reply>

Of the 30 schools concerned, 10 schools had a staffing of 4 teachers or less at the time of amalgamation of which 1 was a 1 teacher school, 6 were 2 teacher schools, 2 were 3 teacher schools and 1 was a 4 teacher school.</p><p>  The initiative for any amalgamation or re-organisation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Boards of Management and in particular, the Patron. Any such proposal to amalgamate schools must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level. The decision making authority for any amalgamation, including any appropriate arrangements, belongs to the Patron of a school subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>  As the numbers of pupils in these schools is relatively small, it is not necessarily the case that capital investment would be needed to support amalgamation. However, each case is assessed on an individual basis to determine the extent and type of accommodation required taking into account the condition of buildings, site capacity etc.  My Department would be available to discuss any issues arising with the Boards of Management of the schools and would aim to provide an appropriate accommodation solution and other resources including staffing subject to available resources.</p></reply>

The level of resources devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.</p><p>  My Department publishes annual statistics on class size data for each school. The most recent statistics are for the 2012/13 school year. The national average class size is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 20,800 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum. The context for any discussion about PTR or class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.</p><p>  The Government will continue to protect front-line services as best as possible. However, it is important to note that all public servants are being asked to do more with less and the teachers in our schools cannot be exempt from this requirement. Within the schools sector we know from international research that while class sizes is a factor the quality of teaching is a far more significant factor in determining outcomes. We therefore have to focus on the drivers of good performance. We need to have the right people becoming teachers. We need the right training for them in College. We need to support them with the right professional development throughout their career. To this end we are making significant changes to both the structure and format of initial teacher education so that our colleges and teachers are comparable with the best in the world.</p></reply>

For the Deputy's convenience, a list of the major new school and extension projects that were completed nationally between 2011 and to date in 2013 is outlined in the following table.</p><p>  The 5 year School Construction Plan announced on 9 March 2012 (which is also detailed on the website), provides for a &euro;2 billion school capital investment programme to 2016, of which &euro;1.5 billion is being allocated to fund major school projects with the balance needed for the additional accommodation scheme, the prefab replacement initiative, the acquisition of sites and other works. The primary aim at the core of the Five Year Plan is focussed on meeting demographic demands to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place and that our school system is in a position to cope with increasing pupil numbers. The Plan prioritises major school projects in areas where future significant demographic changes have been identified.</p><p>  Further to the Five Year Plan, my Department is committed to publishing a detailed annual programme in relation to individual major school projects commencing construction.  In December 2011, details of 56 major school building projects scheduled to commence construction in 2012, the first year of the Plan, were published. In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan (both Plans available on my Department's website). Details of the building projects that are projected to commence construction in 2014 will be announced later this year.</p><p>  In addition, due to additional funding made available for the schools' building programme as part of the Government's &quot;Investing in Infrastructure &amp;amp; Jobs&quot; package announced earlier this year, 28 school projects that were not contained in the 5 year programme but have completed extensive architectural planning are now being progressed to tender and construction.  A project for a replacement school in County Kildare is included in this package.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the Prefab Replacement Initiative 2012, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation. In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for this initiative. In June of this year, I announced a further initiative to replace prefab units with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;15 million has been allocated in 2013/2014 for this purpose. Some 46 schools, with 115 prefab units, will be offered grants to provide the new facilities. Eight schools in County Kildare are benefitting from this Initiative. Replacing prefabs is part of this Government's &euro;475 million education infrastructure plan for 2014. The Plan will provide modern, high quality accommodation for pupils and teachers.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement on 7th November of an additional &euro;70 million for school improvement works. This comprises a once-off payment of over &euro;28 million to primary schools as part of the Minor Works Scheme and a further &euro;40 million to facilitate the re-introduction of the Summer Works Scheme for 2014. </p><p>Details of all applications from schools for large scale capital works may be viewed on my Department's website.</p><p><b>Major School Capital Projects completed 2011 to date

The new System Performance Framework which is being implemented by the Higher Education Authority outlines national priorities and key system objectives against which the performance of the institutions will be assessed.  One of these key system objectives is for the system &quot;to meet Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills by engaged institutions through diverse mix of provision across the system and through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.&quot;</p><p>  The HEA is now engaged in agreeing performance compacts with the HEIs which will be aligned with performance funding to ensure that these objectives are met.  The development of appropriate skills for the workplace has implications for curricula, programme design and teaching methodologies at all levels of the education system. As enterprise sectors develop and expand, demand for employees with core technical and specialist expertise across a range of disciplines continues to grow. Employers also equally value more generic skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication and interpersonal skills, and problem solving abilities.</p><p>  As part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, last year the first National Employers Survey developed by IBEC and other key education and enterprise partners on the quality of Irish graduates was piloted.  The results were very encouraging with more than 75% of employers expressing confidence that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and the relevant knowledge in their subject and discipline.  A full report of its findings can be found at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>  The establishment of structures to engage with enterprise as well as reliable research on labour market needs are necessary to ensure that the system is meeting the needs of enterprise.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which is funded by my Department, plays a pivotal role in advising on future skills needs and any emerging gaps. Its research provides a valuable input to the development of course curricula and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs, including Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion programmes and Skillnets.</p><p>  The Secretary General of my Department chairs an Enterprise Engagement Forum on a regular basis so that representatives and leaders from the enterprise sector can directly engage with the highest levels of senior management in the Department on relevant issues.  We are continually seeking to improve the level of dialogue with enterprise at departmental, national, regional and institutional level throughout the education system.  Irish higher education has an outstanding record in producing graduates with Ireland joint first in the EU for proportion of 30-34 year olds with a higher education qualification.  The reform programme underway will ensure that we maintain and enhance the relevance and quality of provision so that our graduates can continue to compete with the best in the world.</p></reply>

The development of appropriate skills for the workplace has implications for curricula, programme design and teaching methodologies at all levels of the education system.  As enterprise sectors develop and expand, demand for employees with core technical and specialist expertise across a range of disciplines continues to grow.</p><p>  Employers also equally value more generic skills such as creativity, critical thinking, communication and interpersonal skills, and problem solving abilities.  The fostering of these attributes and the development of core foundational skills in numeracy and literacy is built through the experience of students at both primary and second level.  The wide ranging programme of reform which is being rolled out, by my Department, across all levels of the education system seeks to further improve the quality of the teaching and learning experience for all students and to ensure the ongoing supply of high quality graduates for the workforce.</p><p>  Engagement with enterprise is taking place in relation to all aspects of the development and implementation of the education reform programme, including through representation on key bodies and implementation groups.  In order to provide a modern and flexible Irish Apprenticeship System, reflective of the relevant skills requirements of industry and potential apprentices, my Department is currently in the process of carrying out a comprehensive review of the Apprenticeship System.  The independent Apprenticeship Review Group has recently met with relevant stakeholders who provided submissions to the Review Group on how best to improve the current apprentice system in order to discuss their individual submissions further.  It is expected that the Review Group will produce recommendations to my Department by the end of the year.  My Department will continue to work closely with all relevant Government Departments and Agencies to ensure that the Government is putting the right measures in place so that people can upskill and reskill in the areas where skills are in demand.</p></reply>

Please see the link to the reports on my Department's website: <i></i>.  The most recently published data, for the cohort who entered the Junior Cycle in 2006, and sat the Leaving Certificate in either 2011 or 2012, shows a nationally adjusted retention rate to the Leaving Certificate of 90.2%. An updated retention report will be published later in the year.</p><p>  It should be noted that this report deals with retention within the State-aided schooling system only. It does not take account of important educational pathways outside this system such as Youthreach and apprenticeship training. In effect, pupils leaving school to undertake these programmes are treated as early school leavers for the purposes of this analysis. It seems reasonable to assume that the &quot;true‟ retention rate, comparable to completion of upper second-level education (equivalent to NFQ levels 4,5 and 6 Advanced), is higher.  The Higher Education Authority, which is responsible for the collection of data on student progression in the third level sector , is currently working on an analysis of retention rates in the universities and institutes of technology. This has only recently become possible due to a full population of SRS (Student Record System) data becoming available for a period spanning five years.  The HEA does not have information for the 2012/2013 or 2011/2012 academic years and is currently collating data for the 2010/11 academic year which it is hoped will be available for publication in January 2014.</p><p>  There are a range of factors that impact on participation and progression in higher education including economic, social and cultural issues, prior academic attainment and teacher and parental expectations. The most recent report by the HEA on retention entitled, 'A study of Progression in Higher Education', was published in 2010 and is available on the HEA website.  As regards provision of second educational opportunities, the Youthreach programme provides two years integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age. There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella. Almost 3,700 of these places are provided by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in over 100 Youthreach centres with the remainder provided by SOLAS in Community Training Centres (CTCs).  A revitalised Further Education and Training sector under the direction of SOLAS and through the operations of the Education and Training Boards will promote access for all learners who wish to avail of programmes &ndash; including the unemployed and the employed, school leavers as well as early school leavers. The development of the five year strategy for further education and training by SOLAS will provide a road map to the future. This strategy is due to be published within the next 6 months.</p><p>  Effective working arrangements between SOLAS, Intreo and the ETBs under the Pathways to Work Programme is critical to delivering support for those who need it most. My Department will continue to provide quality education and training places for referrals through the Intreo system.  My Department is fully engaging with the process, being led by the Department of Social Protection, to develop the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan. The education system will support the Youth Guarantee through providing quality training and education and work placement opportunities in education and training programmes.</p></reply>

In managing the resource consequences of this, it is important that decisions on school provision and organisation are based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels. Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by my Department in a value for money (VFM) review.  This review took account of the ethos of schools and the locations of small schools relative to other schools of a similar type. The report of the review is under consideration.  The Government is mindful of the concerns of small schools and will take these concerns into account in considering any planning framework for future provision of primary schools.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/14 school year by 15th March, 2013.  The NCSE published details of all of their allocations for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013/2014 school year in June of this year.</p><p>  The NCSE has also now published details of the additional SNA allocations which have been made to schools since the initial allocations were made to schools in June. The NCSE published details of these revised allocations on 21st October, 2013.  These details are now available on the NCSE website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  The level of support required by pupils with special educational needs may change from year to year, in line with their changing care needs including diminishing care needs as they mature and become more independent over time, for example. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.</p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.  Details of the mechanism for schools to appeal a decision in relation to the allocation of SNA support are also available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

My Department has already put a range of support measures in place, particularly in relation to curriculum, assessment and teacher education, as part of its ongoing implementation of the 20 Year Strategy for Irish.  The Teaching Council has been asked to work with teacher education institutions to raise standards among Irish teachers. Work has commenced on the development of a new specification for Irish at Junior Cycle. This specification will clarify the learning outcomes to be achieved by students and place an increased emphasis on the development of oral language skills.</p><p>  Since June 2012, the weighting for oral Irish proficiency in the Leaving Certificate was increased from 25% to 40%. The impact of this change is being reviewed and the findings will be available in 2014. An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG) has been co-located with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) so that the development of curricula and support materials for Irish can take place in a closely co-ordinated way.

Ireland will benefit from all of these funds with the exception of the Cohesion Fund.  Preparations for the new programming period have been underway in Ireland over the past year. This has involved public consultations as well as the preparation of needs analyses and <i>ex-ante</i> evaluations.

The Partnership Agreement will constitute a formal agreement between Ireland and the Commission regarding the use of the Funds.</p><p>  Macro-economic conditionality will be a feature of the next Structural Funds rounds.  This means that the Commission may request a member state to review and propose amendments to its Partnership Agreement and Operational Programmes where this is necessary to support the implementation of relevant Council recommendations to address macroeconomic imbalances and social and economic difficulties and to maximise the growth impact of the Funds in Member States receiving financial assistance from the EU.  Ireland supports measures which underpin good economic governance and improve economic and fiscal discipline.  Macroeconomic conditionality or measures linked to sound economic governance will ensure that Cohesion Policy is consistent with wider EU economic governance.</p><p>  It is important to stress that the process is incremental, starting with amendments to the Partnership Agreement and to the Operational Programmes in support of Council recommendations.  It is only as a last resort, if member states fail to take effective action and economic recommendations are repeatedly and seriously breached, that payments may be suspended.

The agreement reached will see Ireland&rsquo;s share of Structural Funds increase to just over &euro;1 billion which will be used to support a range of projects to promote jobs and growth.  Political agreement on four of the six regulations approved by the European Parliament had been reached under the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers. </p><p>  The next round of Structural Funds will include a special allocation of &euro;150 million for a new cross-border PEACE programme.  In addition the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has announced, in the context of the Building a Prosperous and United Community Pact, an additional &euro;50m UK funding for PEACE IV.   </p><p>  The total funding for the Programmes will be decided as part of the Programme planning process.  The SEUPB continues to develop the Operational Programme for the PEACE IV Programme in close consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in Ireland and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The EU-funded PEACE Programmes have made an important contribution to supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Irish border region and I am glad that support for this valuable work will continue in the 2014-2020 period. </p></reply>

Entrepreneurs can access a range of pre-investment supports from Enterprise Ireland which enable them to investigate the viability and potential of a business idea and to help accelerate their business development. These supports are accessible to entrepreneurs who come forward with strong innovative business ideas. Within this there is a programme focus on the promotion of female-led and regional start-up enterprise creation.  When companies have reached the stage where they are investor ready, they can access Competitive Start Fund Funding which is awarded through a competitive call for applications, or Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;High Potential Start Up&rdquo; offer which provides equity investment to support the implementation of company business plans. </p><p>  In addition to taking direct equity stakes in companies, the State through, Enterprise Ireland has invested heavily in stimulating and facilitating Business Angel investment through the Business Angel HALO programme and in providing access to finance for new and established enterprises through the Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Schemes, the Development Capital Schemes and Innovation Fund Ireland.  I launched the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 this year and this should further increase the availability of capital in the market. In recent months I launched the new &euro;20m Frontline VC fund and had the opportunity to announce the MML &euro;125m Development Capital Fund targeted at investing in more established businesses.</p><p>  All CEBs provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  Their primary role is to support individuals and firms in achieving commercial viability, with priority given to those engaged in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The forms of financial assistance available cover a range of business costs, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, and comprise of, Priming Grants, Business Expansion / Development Grants, and Feasibility / Innovation Grants.  </p><p>  Micro Finance Ireland  is also a source of capital to new companies and entrepreneurs seeking to establish new businesses. MFI lends between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 for commercially viable proposals that have been declined bank credit. This scheme was specifically designed to alleviate the challenges for entrepreneurs establishing businesses who found they could not get bank source bank debt.  My Department continues to work through the Action Plan for Jobs with its agencies and other government departments to increase the availability for funding for entrepreneurs and SMEs. </p></reply>

There are developments elsewhere on this issue. Firstly, in February 2013, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. That Proposal contains provisions regarding the disclosure of beneficial ownership and the Minister for Finance is taking the lead on the Irish position.

Appendix 1, accompanying this reply, sets out details of persons over 15 years of age employed in the main economic sectors throughout the country.</p><p>  As regards the Enterprise Development Agencies which operate under the aegis of my Department, I have provided in Appendices 2, 3, and 4, accompanying this reply, the employment details, including jobs created, since 2011 in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  As these figures are compiled on an annualised basis, the figures for 2013 will be available in the early part of 2014.  The latest Central Statistics Office figures show that employment increased by 3.2% or 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013, bringing total employment to 1,899,300.  We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office, to the present situation where it is creating close to 3,000 jobs per month.</p><p>  As I highlighted in my <i>Budget 2014</i>  , Press Release on 15 October, I expect that more than 48,000 new jobs will be created in 2014 as a result of support from my Department to the Enterprise Development Agencies.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA are targeting the creation of a total of 24,000 gross new jobs in supported companies during 2014 as a result of financial supports allocated under today&rsquo;s Budget. Based on a conservative calculation of standard multiplier effects, this will result in the creation of more than 20,000 additional jobs elsewhere in the economy through supply companies and support services.  The CEBs/LEOs are expected to support the creation of a further 4,500 jobs in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s annual Action Plan for Jobs process, I am determined to continue the transition to a sustainable economy, through growing our exports, and creating the jobs we need. Central to the Action Plan is ensuring greater access for Irish companies to real opportunities to break into new markets, grow their exports and create much needed jobs for this economy.  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue, through that process, to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the last two

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-26a.563.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112600064#WRL01500"><p> Tables 1 - 3 below set out the number of jobs created and lost in counties Longford and Westmeath in respect of client companies of: IDA Ireland; Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards (CEB&rsquo;s) over the past three years,<b><i></i></b>i.e. 2010, 2011 and 2012.  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Longford and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards are all working to promote enterprise development in Counties Longford and Westmeath.  IDA Ireland is charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment  to Ireland and its regions while Enterprise Ireland has responsibility for the development and promotion of Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous business sector. The role of Longford and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. </p><p>  Counties Longford and Westmeath form part of IDA&rsquo;s Midland Region along with Counties Laois, Offaly, and Roscommon. The locations of emphasis for IDA in these counties are the National Spatial Strategy Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore, and Mullingar.  In addition, IDA actively promotes the county towns of Longford, Portlaoise and Roscommon.</p><p>  Counties Longford and Westmeath have traditionally been centres of manufacturing for foreign direct investment, but in recent years it has proved challenging to maintain and attract overseas manufacturing companies into the Counties as much of this investment globally is going to low cost destinations.  Nevertheless, Westmeath is developing itself as a location for high value FDI. </p><p>  At present there are eighteen IDA Ireland supported companies in Westmeath employing 2,444 people and six IDA supported companies in Longford employing approximately 680 people.  </p><p>  In addition to seeking new investment into the region, IDA Ireland also continues to work with the existing client base in the area encouraging them to embed and grow their operations in the Region.  IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment.  IDA is also working with SOLAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling. </p><p>  IDA has also invested in the physical infrastructure required to attract today&rsquo;s FDI to the Region. This included investing &euro;3.5m in a quality flagship Business Park in Athlone which is now an integral part of the agency&rsquo;s international marketing programme.   </p><p>  In 2012, 1,557 people were employed on a full time basis in Enterprise Ireland  client companies in Co. Longford and 2,352 people were employed on a full time basis in EI client companies in Co. Westmeath.  In 2012, &euro;1.33m was paid by EI to companies in Co. Longford and &euro;1.01m was paid to companies in Co. Westmeath for job creation and retention and business development purposes. To date in 2013, EI has held/launched: an Export Awareness Event in Athlone through its new Potential Exporters Division; a Call for Proposals under the Midlands Competitive Feasibility Fund. Nine applicants &ndash; including one from Co. Longford and four from Co. Westmeath - were successful in winning funding and are currently progressing with their start-ups. This new Fund provides funding of up to &euro;25,000 per project.

The aim of the Action Plan is to create a supportive environment for the enterprise sector in order to allow employment to grow across all sectors and for people of all abilities.  </p><p>  Apart from the measures which are aimed at increasing employment across the economy as a whole, Action 240 of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is specifically aimed at promoting the employability of groups that have experienced labour market disadvantage, including those with a disability.  This action is being progressed by the Equality Authority, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter T.D.</p><p>  The Department of Social Protection also provides a range of labour market services for people with disabilities, including training and employment programmes.  In more general terms, many of the schemes which have been introduced by the Government to help people progress into employment - such as the new JobsPlus scheme and the national internship programme, JobBridge - are open to people with disabilities.  </p><p>  In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Kathleen Lynch T.D., is responsible for the development of a ten year comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, which is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan.  </p><p>  I am currently preparing the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and I would be happy to include in that Plan specific actions that Government Departments or agencies may wish to commit to in order to further support the employment of people with disabilities.</p></reply>

The Annual Rate of Valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each Local Authority in their annual budget. The monies raised by Local Authorities through payment of rates funds vital local services for enterprises, including roads, street lighting, maintenance programmes and the provision of advice on a wide range of issues under the remit of local authorities. Conscious of the pressures on businesses at the present time, in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it at the same level as 2012.</p><p>  This Government is committed to making Irish businesses keenly competitive in increasingly challenging global markets. In order to help SMEs to be competitive, we are striving to keep all costs on businesses as low as possible. Government actions to support small and medium sized businesses in the domestic economy have been set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and 2013, and work will continue in this respect in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014. </p><p>  Significant progress has been made in a number of areas, including the introduction of new financing models for SMEs, for example, the Credit Guarantee Scheme and the Microenterprise Loan Fund scheme; tackling the issue of late payments through the transposition of the EU Late Payment Directive into Irish legislation; the introduction of the JobsPlus scheme that provides an employment subsidy to employers who recruit a person who has been unemployed for 12 months or more;  reform of the County Enterprise Boards through the establishment of new Local Enterprise Offices, which is well advanced within my own Department; reductions in the administrative burden on business.  To date, my own Department has achieved a 25% reduction in its administrative burden on business, amounting to a potential annual saving for business of over &euro;207 million.</p><p>  Budget 2014 also contained a number of additional initiatives to support SMEs.  These include an increase in the cash receipts threshold for VAT, which will improve cash-flow for businesses, and a new subsidised Financial Training programme for SMEs. </p><p>  These are just some of the measures which the Government has taken to support the SME sector.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014, which I am currently preparing for the Government, will seek to build on the progress already made and is set to deliver a further suite of actions to support enterprise.  SMEs will continue to be a key focus of this process.</p></reply>

SMEs make up over 99% of businesses in the enterprise economy in Ireland and account for almost 70% of people employed.  That is why within the Action Plan for Jobs process Government has ensured that there is a particular focus on supporting small businesses and work will continue with this focus in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  </p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that significant progress has been made in a number of areas, including improving access to finance through the credit guarantee scheme and the microenterprise loan fund scheme; tackling the issue of late payments through the transposition of the EU Late Payment Directive into Irish legislation; development of a single licensing application portal;  reform of the County Enterprise Boards through the establishment of new local enterprise offices; and improving access to examinership for small companies through the Companies Bill.</p><p>  The Action Plan 2014 will seek to build on this progress and is set to deliver a further suite of actions to support enterprise. SMEs will continue to be a key focus.  In addition to work under the Action Plan for Jobs, further measures to support SMEs were recently announced in Budget 2014, which include: retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector &ndash; to support and encourage growth in small businesses in the tourism sector; capital gains tax relief to encourage investment in new business; removal of the employment and investment incentive from the higher earners restriction, to incentivise higher levels of investment in SMEs; increasing the threshold for the credit review office from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million; supporting cash-flow in the small business sector by increasing the VAT cash threshold from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2 million; a package of improvements in the R&amp;amp;D tax credit aimed particularly at small Irish companies.</p></reply>

Their primary role is to support individuals and firms in achieving commercial viability, with priority given to those engaged in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to entrepreneurs.  The forms of financial assistance available cover a range of business costs, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, and comprise of priming grants, business expansion or development grants, and feasibility or innovation grants.</p><p>  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, etc.  Anyone interested in starting or expanding their own business should in the first instance contact their local County and City Enterprise Board (CEB). Contact details for the CEBs are available on .  In Budget 2014, the Government has provided a total of &euro;18.5 million for CEBs to support enterprise development, an increase of &euro;3.5 million on the Budget 2013 Estimate.</p><p>  I should also point out that the Government established Micro Finance Ireland in 2012 with a view to improving access by small business to loan finance.

In the first six months of 2013, there was an increased number of investments, with approximately 7,000 associated jobs to be created as companies implement and complete their investment plants.  This trend represents a continuation on the strong performance announced by IDA Ireland at the end of 2012, during which year, in excess of 12,000 jobs were created by multinational companies.  The 2012 results represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment in IDA Ireland client companies.  </p><p>  Work in winning new investments has been continuing steadily in the second half of 2013 and, on the basis of the trends so far, I am confident that the targets set out for IDA Ireland in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, of winning more than 130 new investments, securing &euro;500m in R&amp;amp;D and creating 13,000 jobs in IDA client companies, will be achieved.  Among the companies who announced job creation plans or fresh investment plans to date in 2013, were: Ebay, EMC, McAfee, Pfizer, Sanofi, Symantec, Zurich, Huawei, Yahoo, Facebook, Vistakon, Guidewire, Squarespace, Groupon, Qualcomm, Novartis, Nypro, AOL FireEye, and Deutsche Bank.</p><p>  In terms of specific investments in County Donegal, employment data for the county will not be available until the 2013 Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey has been completed.  However, the county continues to benefit from investment by key employers such as United Health, Pramerica and Abbott Diagnostics who together employ approximately 1,500 people in Letterkenny.</p></reply>

Changes to these schemes were announced as part of Budget 2014.  The change to the illness benefit scheme means that the number of days a person must wait before receiving illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection is being increased from three days to six days.  The minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit are being standardised at &euro;230 per week for new applicants.  In general, the changes being introduced to the maternity benefit and illness benefit schemes will not directly impose costs on business, as it is employees themselves who have the entitlement to the benefits.  </p><p>  The halving of employer&rsquo;s PRSI in respect of staff earning up to &euro;356 per week was introduced on a temporary basis in the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative of 2011.  It was intended to stimulate job creation in a very difficult operating environment for business and was scheduled to terminate at the end of this year.  We are now seeing signs of an upturn in the economy, with almost 5,000 jobs per month being created in the private sector.</p><p>  Social protection expenditure remains the largest single area of public spending, accounting for almost 40% of gross current expenditure. As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform pointed out in his budget speech, this area of expenditure cannot be excluded from savings in the context of the need to balance public expenditure.  </p><p>  The changes announced represent small adjustments that were considered appropriate to contribute to the social welfare savings that have to be found in 2014.  The changes must also be seen in the context of a reforming Budget that included a &euro;500 million stimulus package to support enterprise growth and job creation.  </p><p>  The pro-jobs measures in Budget 2014 will allow us to continue to deliver the Action Plan for Jobs process.  From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are targeting the creation of a total of 24,000 gross new jobs during 2014.  This will result in the creation of more than 20,000 additional jobs elsewhere in the economy through supply chains and support services. The CEBs &ndash; which will become the new Local Enterprise Offices in 2014 - are expected to support the creation of a further 4,500 jobs in 2014.</p></reply>

The initiative aims to create 5,000 jobs over five years.  The project is being administered by Connect Ireland, a subsidiary of the Taxback Group, under a contract with IDA Ireland.  The scheme is designed to complement, not compete with, the work of IDA Ireland. </p><p>  This is a completely new and unique initiative, which uses &ldquo;referral marketing&rdquo; techniques in the area of foreign direct investment.  Referral marketing is being used by IDA Ireland for the first time to generate leads and create sustainable employment and to open up an alternative avenue to attract new companies, mainly from the SME sector, to set up in Ireland for the first time.  The initiative provides for the payment of a &ldquo;finder&rsquo;s fee&rdquo; to anybody who acts as an &ldquo;introducer&rdquo; to a foreign company which subsequently establishes an internationally traded service in Ireland.  The reward scheme provides that IDA Ireland will pay up to &euro;4,000, ex VAT, per sustainable job created.  A sustainable job is defined as a job that has been in place for two years.  The aim of the initiative is to generate projects from small and medium sized enterprises, who may not be reached through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s marketing and networking structure, and ideally have the potential for rapid international growth.  </p><p>  The initiative, which is still in a pilot phase, focuses on key sectors, identified in consultation with IDA, which offer the most positive opportunities for Ireland, based on infrastructure and skills availability - high end manufacturing, global services, including financial services, and research development and innovation - and aims to deliver jobs into the regions.  Connect Ireland has funded a significant marketing campaign to raise awareness of the initiative. </p><p>  As the initiative is still in the pilot phase, its workings are under constant review by both IDA Ireland and officials of my Department.  There is a constant level of engagement at very senior level between my Department, IDA Ireland and Connect Ireland.  An evaluation of the scheme will be carried out in the first quarter of 2014 and following completion of that evaluation, I will bring a further memorandum to Government on the Initiative.  To date, 298 jobs have been announced from 11 approved projects.</p></reply>

A continuous and steady flow of new business start-ups plays a crucial role in creating jobs and sustainable economic growth and will be central to Ireland emerging out of its current problems</p><p>  To assist entrepreneurial activity, work is ongoing to deliver a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement for Q4 of 2013.  This new policy statement will be focussed on entrepreneurship in terms of start-up companies and aims to ensure that the overall environment is conducive to increasing the levels of people starting up new businesses across all industry sectors, both domestically trading and export-oriented.  Within this statement there will also be a focus on youth entrepreneurship.  </p><p>  To support the development of the policy statement, I have been keen to take suggestions and advice from people who have actually taken the entrepreneurial route, have direct experience of the challenges facing entrepreneurs and can provide a relevant insight into the responses needed in the current economic environment.  Therefore, I established an entrepreneurship advisory forum, chaired by entrepreneur and investor Sean O&rsquo;Sullivan in May 2013 to draft appropriate policy conclusions and recommendations which will support business start-ups, sustainable growth and long term job creation. The Forum&rsquo;s Report is to be presented to me shortly. </p><p>  In advance of the work of the forum and to ensure that the forum had information on the latest views of the entrepreneurial community, my Department held a public consultation in May of this year inviting interested parties to submit written views and suggestions to support the development of a national entrepreneurship policy statement.  A total of 74 written submissions were received and these have been very useful in concentrating the work on the key areas of importance.  I also had my officials organise a number of face to face meetings throughout the summer and autumn with various entrepreneurs and stakeholders to ensure that the work remained focused on the relevant issues.    </p><p>  The findings and recommendations arising from the entrepreneurship forum, the public consultation submissions and the stakeholder discussions will all feed into the drafting of a national entrepreneurship policy statement which I hope to complete shortly.   Following the publication of the policy statement, a number of specific actions, incorporating both commitments from the Government policy statement, and the entrepreneurship forum&rsquo;s recommendations will be included for immediate implementation in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland and to develop an implementation plan for approval of Government and transmission to the EU before the end of the year. </p><p>  As an initial step towards preparing for implementation of the guarantee, provision was made in the 2014 Budget for hanging the eligibility criteria for Jobs Plus to make it easier for young people to qualify for the scheme; an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme; ensuring that 1,000 places on the  T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people; developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job; ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my Department; the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.</p><p>  In addition to these provisions in Budget 2014, young people will continue to benefit from places already available under schemes such as the Back to Education Allowance scheme, JobBridge, VTOS and Youthreach, as well as the provision of training programmes for unemployed people funded by Solas.  </p><p>  In total it is expected that these activation programmes will provide over 91,000 opportunities for new participants in 2014 of all ages.

The scheme has been launched in this targeted way to allocate scarce exchequer resources to make maximum impact for long term unemployment while ensuring that it does not replace or displace the normal operation of the labour market.</p><p>  However, I wish to advise that there are a range of other supports available to assist those in receipt of Blind Pension such as the Work Placement Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme.  I would recommend that an individual contact their local Intreo/Employment Service Office to arrange a meeting so that these and other appropriate options could be discussed in greater depth. </p><p>  The projected cost of providing an additional 1,500 places for those under 25 years of age in 2014 would be approximately &euro;7m.  This is based on the places being provided on a staggered basis throughout 2014. </p><p>  The &lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo; section of the JobBridge website already provides a facility for raising queries or complaints relating to the operation of the scheme.  The Department takes all allegations of abuse very seriously and all such allegations are thoroughly investigated.  It is worth noting that the Department has conducted over 3,700 on-site monitoring visits to-date.  43,800 vacancies have been advertised on the JobBridge website since it came into operation.  As at 21 November, 2013, 23,537 JobBridge internships had commenced.  A vacancy is advertised for a maximum of 8 weeks and may be re-advertised if it is not filled.  </p><p>  To date, there have been a total of 59 teaching internships, of which 29 internships are still active.  Of the 30 individuals who have finished teaching internships, the Department&rsquo;s records indicate that 9 of these have progressed into employment on immediate completion of their internship.</p></reply>

The young unemployed are included in the overall number of NEETs, and high youth unemployment is the main reason why the level of NEETs is also high in Ireland. </p><p>  Unlike many other countries, Ireland has a universal job-seekers&rsquo; allowance available to young unemployed people without prior work experience, as well as similar welfare supports for young lone parents and people with disabilities.  The number of persons not in employment, training or education but not registered with the my Department, and thus not captured in the official statistics, is therefore likely to be small by comparison with a number of other European countries.</p></reply>

However, if over the course of the year their gross annual income was less than &euro;26,000 a refund of the health contribution may be due.  In order to confirm that a refund is due my Department must carry out a manual check to ensure that the correct rate of PRSI was applied over the course of the relevant tax year.  It is not possible to identify the number of people who are entitled to a health contribution refund until this check is carried out.  </p><p>  To date my Department has received over 290,000 applications for health contribution refunds.  The processing of these applications is up to date and has resulted in approximately 48% of applicants receiving refunds.  The amount of health contribution refunded to date is approximately &euro;46.2 million.</p><p>  Applications for refunds must be made within four years of the end of the year that the contribution was paid.  For example, you must apply for a refund of health contributions paid in 2009 by 31 December 2013.  Any contributions paid prior to 1 January 2009 are outside the time limit for making a claim.  </p><p>  The position with regard to liability is that if a person earned more than &euro;26,000 in 2009 and/or 2010 they were liable to pay the health contribution and are not due a refund.  If a person earned less than &euro;26,000 and never earned more than &euro;500 in any one week they would not have been charged the health contribution and are not eligible for a refund.  A person may be entitled to a refund of the health contribution if they have earned less than &euro;26,000 in 2009 and/or 2010 and earned more than &euro;500 in any particular week in those years. </p><p>  Also employees who are Medical Card holders; recipients of social welfare widow's/widower's pension; one parent family payment; deserted wife's benefit, or certain EU pensions and payments, are exempt from the health element of the PRSI contribution (i.e. they are liable at the sub-class of contribution - A2, B2, C2, etc.).  Refunds arise if the full contribution has been paid.  The health contribution was included in the Universal Social Charge (USC) with effect from 1 January 2011 and no health contribution refunds arise after that date.</p></reply>

The Government has sought to maximise the possible benefits to Ireland in these negotiations.  It has now been indicated, provisionally, that Ireland will be allocated funding of &euro;63.66 million (at 2011 prices; &euro;68.15 million at current prices) from the YEI in respect of the two-year period 2014-2015. This will need to be matched by at least the same amount of ESF funding. </p><p>  Given the way the funding is structured, in order to recoup these amounts from the YEI/ESF in due course, it will be necessary for Ireland, in the first instance, to incur eligible expenditure on youth employment initiatives of approximately &euro;200 million over this two-year period, and to apply subsequently for recoupment from the EU. It is expected that actual expenditure by Ireland on youth employment initiatives will be substantially in excess of this &euro;200 million minimum. The first EU refunds would become available during 2015 at the earliest, based on our actual spend in 2014.</p><p>  Allocations from the YEI for 2014 and 2015 are based on agreed criteria. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation is based on the average number of young people unemployed here in 2012, and the proportion this represented of all unemployed young people across the EU regions eligible for YEI (essentially regions that had youth unemployment rates over 25% in 2012). No further changes to these criteria are expected.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for this group are to review the current range of youth employment services in Ireland, to assess what measures are appropriate to deliver the Youth Guarantee in Ireland and to develop the implementation plan for approval of Government and transmission to the EU.</p><p>  In addition, in order to get non-governmental input into the Youth Guarantee implementation plan the Department of Social Protection held a YG stakeholders&rsquo; consultation forum in October. The DSP has invited further submissions from the bodies that attended. In addition the Department has retained the OECD to provide input and advice on the framing of the plan (the OECD is also providing assistance to a number of other countries).  As part of this process a delegation from the OECD met with stakeholders at the aforementioned forum as well as with a range of relevant public bodies. Ultimately stakeholder feedback via the forum, submissions and bilateral meetings with the OECD has fed into the design of the national YG implementation plan.</p><p>  A Labour Market Council (LMC) has also been established. The LMC is comprised of ministerial appointees from the business, trade union, community and voluntary and academic sectors which was established in September of this year. The LMC reports directly to the Minister for Social on matters of labour market policy. One of the main tasks of the LMC is to advise on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.</p></reply>

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.</p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers. While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity/gas allowance and the free television licence. We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase.</p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full. The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any specialised telephone equipment. Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance. I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this. </p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer. The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There has been a marked decline in the use of specialist telecommunications equipment for people with hearing difficulties since the advent of mobile and smart &lsquo;phones.</p></reply>

At that time, the numbers of such workers had risen significantly and there was insufficient time available following the receipt of employer verified data to manually enter the weekly employment details onto the system.  In order to eliminate delays in the generation of payments, the employer input was removed from the process at that time.  </p><p>  The situation has been monitored in the period since then by the Department and fraudulent claiming has been detected in a number of instances.  The most common cases involved over-claiming by adding additional days to the docket, failure to notify the Department of a return to full-time employment, or of leaving employment, and a lack of facility on the docket to advise the Department where an employee had refused an offer of additional work.</p><p>  In order to address this situation, the Department has utilised recent improvements in scanning technologies to produce a new docket, which can be scanned into the system and will deliver improvements in the following areas:</p><p> - improved control through re-introducing advance employer verification of work patterns;</p><p> - improved information on customer circumstances through the provision of a mechanism to notify the Department where an offer of additional work has been made by the employer;</p><p> - Improved administrative efficiency as weekly employment details are scanned in rather than manually entered.</p><p>It is expected that the use of the new form and scanning process will be extended to all local offices by mid-2014.</p><p>  I recognise these arrangements can cause difficulties in a small number of cases and, in these circumstances, alternative arrangements can be put in place such as the acceptance of a signature from the employer&rsquo;s local representative (e.g. a local supervisor or manager).

Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at a young age can lead to welfare dependency from an early age. If they do not improve their skills, young jobseekers are at risk of becoming long term unemployed.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. Consequently in 2009 changes were made to jobseeker's allowance so reduced rates of payment were paid to jobseekers under 25 years of age. Currently jobseekers aged 18-21 years of age receive &euro;100 per week, while jobseekers aged 22-24 years of age receive &euro;144 per week. Where these individuals engage in education or training they will receive &euro;160 per week.</p><p>  A key priority for the Government's labour market activation strategy is engaging with and providing supports to unemployed persons. A key strand in this process is to ensure that each person in receipt of a jobseeker payment fulfils their personal responsibility to engage fully with the employment and training supports provided by the State, as a precondition for receipt of their welfare payments.</p><p>  Sanctions in the form of reduced payment rates for jobseekers were introduced in April 2011 as a means of achieving the engagement of jobseekers with activation measures. These rates reduce the amount of personal rate payable under the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes where a person fails, without just cause, to engage with activation processes. Table 1 depicts the current rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance weekly payments for different age cohorts of jobseeker allowance recipients. It also depicts the amount of jobseeker allowance payment each cohort would receive if they are subject to penalty rates being applied.</p><p><b>Table 1: Jobseeker's Allowance Weekly Rates and Penalty Rates</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th><b>Weekly Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance 18-21 years of age</b></th><th><b>Weekly Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance 22-24 years of age</b></th><th><b>Weekly Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for recipients aged 25 and over</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Full personal JA rate</b></td><td><b>&euro;100</b></td><td><b>&euro;144</b></td><td><b>&euro;188</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Reduced Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance due to penalty rates being imposed</b></td><td><b>&euro;75</b></td><td><b>&euro;111</b></td><td><b>&euro;144</b></td></tr></table></p><p>  Table 2 depicts the amount of jobseeker's benefit an individual can receive and the reduced rate they will receive if penalty rates are imposed on them. It should be noted that under jobseeker's benefit rates are graduated according to an individual&rsquo;s earnings in the relevant tax year.</p><p><b>Table 2 Jobseeker's Benefit Weekly Rates and Penalty Rates</b><table><tr><th><b>Previous average weekly earnings</b></th><th><b>Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit Personal rate </b></th><th><b>Penalty Rates</b></th></tr><tr><td><b>Less than &euro;150 </b></td><td><b>&euro;84.50</b></td><td><b>&euro;65 </b></td></tr><tr><td><b>&euro;150 - &euro;219.99</b></td><td><b>&euro;121.40</b></td><td><b>&euro;93</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>&euro;220 - &euro;299.99</b></td><td><b>&euro;147.30</b></td><td><b>&euro;113</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>&euro;300 or more</b></td><td><b>&euro;188 </b></td><td><b>&euro;144</b></td></tr></table>  There is also provision for further sanctions, in the form of a disqualification for a period of up to 9 weeks, in circumstances where a customer who has had such a rate imposed for 21 days and continues to fail to engage with activation measures.</p></reply>

The potential contribution of such contracting and the design of a contracting approach have since been under consideration by the Department. JobPath is the working title for this new service.</p><p>  During the summer the Department issued a Prior Information Notice (PIN) to formally notify the market of the State&rsquo;s intention to procure employment services. Such services may include the provision of advice and assistance regarding job searching; employment and career options; personal action plans; personal skills; work experience; training/further education; preparation of CVs as well as recruitment services to employers and &lsquo;in-work&rsquo; advice/coaching to jobseekers. The Department also held two JobPath information sessions at which it outlined its current thinking in relation to how the new service might operate. On 7 November 2013, Enterprise Ireland hosted a capacity building and networking event for interested parties of JobPath. It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to issue a contract notice for the procurement of JobPath services in the near future.</p></reply>

The service, which differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice, has three elements:</p><p>  - The website    which was developed as the key online access portal for general mortgage information and advice and launched in June 2012.</p><p>  - The Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline (phone 0761 074050) established in August 2012, provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting in relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears  and other supports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  - The provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders launched in September 2012.</p><p>The advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland.  A county by county panel with over 2000 participating accountants is in place and their details are available on   Borrowers are free to choose their own advisor from this panel and the lender will pay &euro;250 to the accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choice for the provision of this advice.</p><p>  The Central Bank collates the information relating to the number of borrowers who have availed of the independent financial advice service and it is only available on a quarterly basis commencing in quarter1 2013.  The data supplied doesn&rsquo;t relate exactly to the reporting period as there will be delays between the time the lender makes the long-term resolution offer to the borrower, the meeting with the accountant and the receipt by the lender of the invoice.  A full review of the independent financial advice service is underway to ensure that the service is meeting its objectives.  The review encompasses all aspects of the service and is expected to be completed shortly and will be published in due course.</p><p>  The data requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Helpline Calls</th><th>Keepingyourhome.ie </th><th>Financial Advice Service ( invoices received by lenders)</th></tr><tr><td>August 2012</td><td>295</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September 2012</td><td>397</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>October 2012</td><td>459</td><td>*34,157</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2012</td><td>410</td><td>6,434</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>December 2012</td><td>259</td><td>8,150</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>January 2013</td><td>577</td><td>9,955</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>February 2013</td><td>529</td><td>10,073</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>March 2013</td><td>737</td><td>12,243</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>April 2013</td><td>973</td><td>17,813</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May 2013</td><td>610</td><td>9,463</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>June 2013</td><td>504</td><td>10,194</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>July 2013</td><td>473</td><td>9,632</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>August 2013</td><td>590</td><td>12,621</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>September 2013</td><td>521</td><td>8,438</td><td>182</td></tr><tr><td>October 2013</td><td>641</td><td>12,815</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>November 2013  (up to and including Nov 15)</td><td>207</td><td>4,910</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>8,182</td><td>169,378</td><td></td></tr></table>*Covers the period June 2012 to October 2012.</p></reply>

I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the current average time taken to process a carer's allowance appeal is 28.7 weeks overall.

She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right of review or appeal.  The person concerned appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 28 May 2013.  The decision before the appeals officer  was whether the deciding officer was correct in refusing the application based on the evidence provided by the applicant on their application form and as reported by the Social Welfare Inspector who investigated the claim.  After careful consideration of all aspects of the case the appeals officer decided that the qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance were not fully met in this case and, consequently, the appeal was disallowed.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office wrote to the person in question on 24 October 2013 to notify them of this decision.  The appeals officer noted in their decision that if the circumstances of the person concerned had changed since the decision was made to refuse their application that it is open to them to re-apply by submitting a fresh claim.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  Child benefit is currently paid to around 612,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion.  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children.  The Government is conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment.  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births.  As a result parents with twins will receive a child benefit payment of &euro;4,680 a year while parents with triplets will receive &euro;9,360 per year.  Therefore, families with twins receive &euro;1,560 more a year than a family consisting of two single birth children. In the case of a family with triplets, the additional support would amount to &euro;4,680 a year over the support given to a family consisting of three single birth children.</p><p>  Special rates of payment for children of multiple births have been a feature of the child benefit scheme since the mid-1960s.  The rationale for monthly premia rates was linked with the additional costs that might arise in cases of multiple births compared to other households with the same number of children but of different ages.  The higher level of support extended to parents of children of multiple births is therefore significant, especially when considered over an entire childhood.  Any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments are a matter to be decided in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;3.66 billion in 2013.  It is a fundamental qualifying condition of both schemes that a person must be fully unemployed for four in any period of seven consecutive days, so a person working seven days a week will not qualify.  Where a jobseeker takes up employment the part-time job incentive scheme may, subject to scheme criteria, support them in making such a transition to employment.  The scheme allows persons who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a weekly income supplement.  Participants in this scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.</p><p>    It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  This is an important policy issue for my Department but any changes to the current criteria could have significant cost implications.  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has already reported to me on a number of important policy areas, is now looking at the whole area of atypical work and I look forward to their recommendations on this issue over the coming months.</p></reply>

In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.  In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined. In such cases, documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place and being availed of before a decision can be made. The fact that one parent is in receipt of rent supplement would not, in itself, preclude the other parent from being entitled to assistance towards their rent.</p></reply>

These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice &amp;amp; Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.

Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office. </p><p>  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.</p><p>  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 16,087 at 18 November 2013.  In 2010 the average processing time for a disability allowance oral hearing was 51.1 weeks while a decision requiring a summary decision took an average of 30.8 weeks.  This had improved to 40.6 and 34.2 weeks respectively in 2012 and has further improved (up to October 2013) to 38.3 and 29.7 weeks respectively. </p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 81,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013. </p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014. The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  There have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin and Galway while there have been some reductions across a number of counties, including some categories in County Meath, reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties. Special provisions are made in exceptional circumstances including, for example, people with disabilities in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons. </p><p>  There are currently 1,981 rent supplement recipients in County Meath, of which almost 200 are in the Ashbourne and Ratoath areas.  In arriving at the appropriate rent limits for County Meath rent levels in the major population centres in the county were tested. Analysis shows that there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients in County Meath. However, the number of rental properties available in the specific locations referred to by the Deputy is significantly lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county and therefore impacts on the number of accommodation units available for renting and their cost. </p><p>  A search conducted on a leading property website shows that there are a total of 121 two and three bed properties for rent in County Meath, of which 12 were available in the Ratoath and Ashbourne areas. None of the 12 properties in these two areas were advertised below the rent limit. It must be stressed, however, that the purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise the rent limits at this time.</p></reply>

The purpose of the summit was to enable EU leaders and Labour/Social Protection Ministers to share national experiences in dealing with youth unemployment, take stock of the implementation commitments made in the Youth Guarantee and the associated Youth employment Initiative and discuss how to mobilise the European funding and support quickly and effectively. The summit reiterated the importance of member states completing national Implementation Plans to deliver the Youth Guarantee. An implementation plan for Ireland is currently in development and will be forwarded to the EU commission by the end of the year.</p><p>  It was agreed that EU leaders and Labour/Social Protection Ministers will continue to meet at special summits to deal specifically with  youth unemployment The next summit  is provisionally scheduled for Spring 2014 in Italy.</p></reply>

The level of employment of young people appears to have stabilised, and indeed the employment rate (proportion of the population with jobs) for those aged 20-24 years rose from 46.5% in mid-2012 to 49% in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>  In the first instance, the Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle all forms of unemployment, including youth unemployment, is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and thus reduce unemployment and long-term unemployment.  Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery.  The Government is also implementing a number of programmes to assist young unemployed persons and keep young jobseekers close to the labour market.</p><p>  There are five main approaches being taken to tackle youth unemployment: education, training, job search assistance/guidance, work experience, and encouraging job creation.  These actions range across a number of Departments and Agencies and include:-  </p><p> - The Youthreach programme providing 6,000 integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers without any qualifications or vocational training who are between 15 and 20 years of age; </p><p> - The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme scheme, which provides a range of courses to meet the education and training needs of unemployed people over 21 years of age, particularly focusing upon early school leavers;  </p><p> - The Back to Education Allowance scheme run by the Department of Social Protection provides income maintenance for unemployed people returning to further or higher education. Over 6,500 young people participated on this scheme in the last academic year; </p><p> - Approximately 12,000 persons aged under 25 completed a training course with F&Aacute;S in 2012.

Under this scheme the State will pay circa &euro;1 of every &euro;4 it costs the employer to recruit a person from the Live Register.  </p><p>  Looking forward, in addition to current initiatives, policies to increase youth employment will be supplemented by additional measures under the Youth Guarantee which will be rolled out in 2014.  The Department of Social Protection has set up an interdepartmental group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the implementation of the Guarantee.

Sowing the seeds of entrepreneurship and exposing students to the fundamentals of business is an integral part of promoting an entrepreneurial culture. Enterprise Ireland coordinated and supported a number of the initiatives in 2012 to promote youth entrepreneurship and engagement in the world of hi-tech. These included CoderDojo, an Irish-led movement that is teaching kids globally to code software, and our annual Think Outside the Box awards, which aim to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship among third level students</p><p><b><i>Competitive Start Fund </i></b></p><p>  The purpose of the Competitive Start Fund is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets. The fund is designed to enable those companies reach key commercial and technical milestones, for example:</p><p>  - Evaluate overseas market opportunities and reach firm conclusions regarding the viability of the proposed business.</p><p>  - Build a prototype.</p><p>  - Secure a reference site.</p><p>  - Develop a market entry plan for exploiting international opportunities.</p><p>  - Secure partnership deal or strategic alliance.</p><p>  - Identify suitable channels to international markets.</p><p>  - Secure third party investment e.g. business angel, Venture Capital.</p><p>  The CSF is open to entrepreneurs establishing early-stage businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. As with all EI supports, there are no set age limits, and there is a modest level of investment from the promoter required to avail of EI funding. As such, the CSF can represent an opportunity for youth entrepreneurs to avail of seed funding where the proposed project has international potential. </p><p><b><i>Think Outside The Box Awards</i></b></p><p>  The Think Outside the Box Awards is aimed at third level students with a novel idea for a new business. Focusing on the development of business ideas with real commercial potential the provides cash prizes  and the opportunity to avail of &euro;30,000 worth of specialist advice and assistance to potentially help turn the enterprise idea into a business reality. The awards are sponsored by Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland, Intel, Cruickshank Intellectual Property Attorneys and Grant Thornton. The Think Outside The Box Awards have an exclusive focus on third level students, from all academic disciplines and courses of study, and offer the opportunity to realise entrepreneurial ambitions. Given the focus of the Awards (third level), a significant number of the participants are in the youth entrepreneur cohort. Former winners have gone on to participate in business start-ups, and have availed of EI support.</p><p><b><i>New Frontiers</i></b></p><p>  New Frontiers is Ireland&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme that is delivered at a local level by the Institutes of Technology. For those with an innovative business idea and planning to establish and run your own company, the New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme can provide a package of supports to help accelerate business development and to equip entrepreneurs with the skills and contacts needed to successfully start and grow your company.</p><p>  New Frontiers provides Entrepreneurs with:</p><p>  - Training in all areas of business including financial management, market research &amp;amp; validation, business process, patenting, product development, sales training;</p><p>  - Mentoring from experienced business advisers and practitioners;</p><p>  - Office and other business incubation facilities;</p><p>  - &euro;15,000 scholarship to cover full-time participation in the six month course;</p><p>  - Networking with other entrepreneurs and business development agencies;</p><p>  - Introductions to seed and early stage capital investment networks;</p><p>  - Access to entrepreneurship best practice, both national and international;</p><p>  - Peer-group learning from participants in the region and across the country;</p><p>  - Access to the expertise in Enterprise Ireland through our Market Research Centre;</p><p>  - Expertise from the Institutes of Technology and the supportive environment of their business incubation centres.</p><p>  Launched in February 2012, the New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme aims to support the creation of 100 high value, knowledge based, Irish owned businesses, each year.  The programme can represent a good avenue for youth entrepreneurs with an innovative business idea to develop and hone their plans and develop an investor ready proposition. </p><p><b><i>FoodWorks</i></b></p><p>  Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc are working together on a food sector entrepneurship programme which offers access to a range of supports including assistance in developing the business proposition, market research, and advice on business financing and supplier development. </p><p><b>SME Input:</b></p><p>  Successful entrepreneurship is critical to Irish economic development, and consequently, supporting entrepreneurship is a central part of our Action Plan for Jobs.  67% of all new job-creation comes from businesses in the first five years of existence. A continuous and steady flow of new business start-ups plays a crucial role in creating jobs and sustainable economic growth and will be central to Ireland emerging out of its current problems</p><p>  To assist entrepreneurial activity, work is ongoing to deliver a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement for Q4 of 2013. This new policy statement will be focussed on entrepreneurship in terms of start-up companies and aims to ensure that the overall environment is conducive to increasing the levels of people starting up new businesses across all industry sectors, both domestically trading and export-oriented.  Within this statement there will also be a focus on youth entrepreneurship.  Following the publication of the Policy Statement, a number of specific actions will be included for immediate implementation in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  </p><p><b>CEB Input:</b></p><p>  The County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) throughout the country provide supports, both financial and non-financial or &quot;soft&quot; supports, to all micro-enterprises in the start-up or expansion phase in manufacturing, tourism and services, subject to certain conditions. The soft supports include the provision of business advice, training and mentoring to all clients. The aim is to develop indigenous enterprise potential, stimulate economic activity at local level and promote the establishment of micro-enterprises within their administrative area. These supports are available to everyone, regardless of age.</p><p>  The CEBs are also active in engaging with schools to promote entrepreneurship within the education system, primarily through close engagement with second level schools throughout Ireland but are also active with primary schools and third level colleges.  The flagship of these activities is the national second level Student Enterprise Awards which attracts the participation of over 15,000 students from schools throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p><p>  The Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, together with the Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring.</p></reply>

The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.</p><p>  Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department but it is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations.  This includes independence in its funding decisions.  In 2014, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;55.8 million in current and capital funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at .  In a wider context, the Arts Council support for a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013</i>.  This strategy document, which is available on the Council's website, lays out the key strategic principles that inform the Council's funding decisions.</p><p>  My Department also funds targeted initiatives for music which are channelled through Music Network. These include a national music day and a national music instrument scheme. Love: Live Music Day, the national music day, is an annual celebration of all forms of music in Ireland. It aims to promote access to live music for all, regardless of location through free nationwide music events. The musical instrument scheme operated by Music Network assists individuals and groups to purchase musical instruments. Further details are available at .  </p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy.  The arts sector continues to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, heritage, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of these sectors. I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding and to providing every possible support for these sectors.</p></reply>

Biogas can be utilised to generate electricity, heat or as a transport fuel. Electricity production from biogas (using anaerobic digestion and landfill gas) is already supported under the REFIT schemes, and biogas, when used as a transport fuel, can be used to meet the obligations set under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.  Biomethane, which is produced by removing impurities from biogas, can be used as a substitute for natural gas and can be injected directly into the gas grid. In this regard, any sale of the Bord Gais Energy business should not have any impact on the future development potential of the biogas sector. The BGE gas networks are being retained in State ownership as strategic national infrastructure. Last September, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) invited views on facilitating the injection of biogas into the natural gas grid. This consultation closed on the 23 October and I understand that the CER is currently assessing the responses and expects to publish a decision paper in 2014. </p><p>  Biomethane can also be used in Natural Gas Vehicles (NGV) and their increased deployment could present opportunities for biomethane use in the transport sector. However, the technology is at a relatively early stage of development and there are no immediate plans for the use of NGVs, or vehicles that run on biogas, for Government owned vehicles. However, it should be noted that the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for procuring Public Services Obligation (PSO) vehicles on behalf of Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, takes environmental and energy criteria into account when making such procurement decisions in accordance with EU Directive 2009/33/EC. </p><p>  More generally, and given the stage of technology development and cost, detailed economic analysis of the supply chains, from production through to distribution and use, is required before any additional supports for biogas and biomethane appropriate to Ireland can be considered. This analysis will be carried forward in the context of implementing the forthcoming Bioenergy Strategy which is currently being finalised by my Department.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Longford and Westmeath, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>  The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services. The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis, as in the case of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme. The MANs, which consist of carrier-neutral duct and fibre rings, are available in 94 towns throughout the country and enable telecoms operators to offer high speed broadband to their retail customers without having to build their own networks. Within Counties Longford and Westmeath, MANs are located in Longford town, Athlone and Mullingar. I understand that the commercial sector is also investing in high speed broadband in a number of areas in Longford and Westmeath, with enhanced broadband services being offered in this areas between now and June 2014.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in Counties Longford and Westmeath. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector, the results of which will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014. </p><p>  This process will include a detailed specification of our requirements to deliver on the commitments in the National Broadband Plan. In designing any State-led procurement, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules in relation to the technology to be rolled out. The European Commission's guidelines set out that as different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, the tender should not favour or exclude any particular technology or network platform.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

These schemes were introduced to incentivise the development of renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to allow Ireland to meet its target of 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation by 2020. REFIT is based around 15 year Power Purchase Agreements between generators and suppliers which provide developers with the certainty necessary to finance their projects.  REFIT is funded from the Public Service Obligation levy. The REFIT 1 scheme is now closed for applications. The REFIT 2 scheme was opened for applications in March 2012 and has a deadline of the end of 2017 for qualifying projects.</p><p>  A number of tax based support measures are also available. Tax relief is available under Section 486b of the 1998 Finance Act, on capital directly invested in renewable energy assets. All renewable electricity generating technologies can avail of Section 486B of the Tax Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 which allows an investor to claim the lesser of 50% of all capital expenditure (excluding lands) or &euro;9.525 million for a single project. Investment by a company or group under this scheme is capped at &euro;12.7 million per annum. Corporate investors in renewable energy projects can claim tax relief on equity investment in capital assets.</p><p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme allows individual investors to obtain income tax relief on investments in renewable energy in each tax year. This scheme supersedes the previous Business Expansion Scheme. It provides a minimum tax relief of 30% with an additional 11% accruing at the end of the third and final year if the business has expanded to employ a designated number of people (or if the investment was used for R&amp;amp;D). The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and is thus suited to micro-hydroelectricity generating projects. An Accelerated Capital Allowance scheme also allows companies to offset the cost of investment in qualifying renewable energy generation technologies against their tax liabilities in Year 1 rather than over a more prolonged period of years, thus aiding their cash flow.</p><p>  Finally, renewable energy is also an eligible activity for EU rural development funding identified in the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development. Individuals or companies developing or upgrading micro-hydroelectric generators may apply for funding under the regional Leader Partnerships.</p></reply>

The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  My Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users. The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met. The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources, with the transport target also being legally binding.</p><p>  The Directive also requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets. Ireland's NREAP assumes Ireland's 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum. Provisional figures for 2012 have now been further refined and indicate that 7.1% of our overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, made up of 19.6% in electricity, 5.2% in heat and 2.4% in transport. A second progress report on the NREAP is due for completion by the end of this year.</p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was over 2,100 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. In order to facilitate the rate of build of renewable generation capacity required to meet the 2020 target, a number of changes to the REFIT 1 and 2 schemes were introduced in 2013. Full details of the revised terms and conditions of these schemes can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

To reach the 16% target, Ireland is committed to achieving 40% of electricity, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable resources by 2020.  Wind generally displaces marginal generation plant, which are either gas or oil. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) estimates that the overall avoided imports from wind alone since 2006 are as follows: <table><tr><th></th><th>2006</th><th>2007</th><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th></tr><tr><td>Avoided gas and oil imports - &euro; million</td><td>107</td><td>90</td><td>147</td><td>114</td><td>134</td><td>242</td><td>255</td></tr></table></p><p>  This work shows that, in total since 2006, wind energy has avoided approximately &euro;1.1 billion in fossil fuel imports, primarily of gas, but also some oil. Wind generation does not tend to displace coal in Ireland.  The SEAI&rsquo;s work in this area also indicates that fossil fuel dependency in Ireland may be reduced by a further 15% by the deployment of renewable energy by the year 2020. This demonstrates that indigenous renewable energy can reduce both our exposure to volatile global fossil fuel prices, and harmful emissions, thus delivering real environmental and economic benefits for Ireland.</p></reply>

The process for participating in the mapping exercise has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website () and notified to all undertakings authorised by ComReg. Information has been sought from participating operators in respect of current coverage as well as investments planned up to July 2016 and beyond, where appropriate. Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is now underway. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.   It is my intention to publish the map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage early next year, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. </p><p>  In order to obtain State Aid clearance from the European Commission it will be necessary to formally notify the Commission of the proposed intervention, setting out a detailed description of the proposed measure and the actions Ireland has taken, and will take, to comply with the Commission's guidelines in relation broadband networks. The mapping process which will inform the intervention is still ongoing and therefore it would be premature to submit a formal State Aid notification at this stage. My officials have, however, commenced dialogue with the European Commission and this engagement will intensify over the coming months. </p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  Site Resolution Plans (SRP&rsquo;s) have been identified by the NCC as a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments.  Such plans enable stakeholders, including developers, local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents to collaborate in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites.  The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions also take account of the best interests of residents. </p><p>  The NCC has produced a Guidance Manual on Resolving and Managing Unfinished Estates, a Key Stakeholders Code of Practice, and a Guide for Residents Living in Unfinished Housing Developments, all of which are available at .  Other notable achievements included an assessment of the adequacy of current planning legislation and regulations via the legislative review group, as well as the public safety initiative which secured unsafe aspects of unfinished estates from a health and safety perspective.  The NCC has achieved real progress in tackling the issues in unfinished estates as evidenced by the reduction of problematic estates from 2,846 when the Government took office to the current level of just over 1,200, a 53% reduction.  It is anticipated that further progress will be made, further buoyed by the &euro;10 million Site Resolution Fund recently provided for in Budget 2014.</p><p>  It is inevitable however that a number of estates for a variety of reasons will not become viable, and in such cases a return to greenfield status may be the most pragmatic option.  In this context relevant local authorities and financial institutions are identifying developments that might fail agreed viability criteria and to date my Department understands that some 40 developments, or more precisely uncompleted parts of same, at unspecified locations may be likely to be returned to greenfield usage.  Other sites may emerge in time as unviable and be similarly treated. </p><p>  My Department does not hold data on the specific sites involved, or on the cost of restoring them to greenfield status, as they are the responsibility of those who currently hold title to them and the cost of site clearance is a matter for them alone and not for my Department.  Similarly, local authorities have neither the responsibility nor the right to complete estates which are not within their ownership.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013.  Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.   </p><p>  Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones.  They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses, in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures. Under the <i>Action Plan for Jobs, </i>the local government sector has developed a sectoral strategy, <i><i>Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs &ndash; Locally</i></i><i>,</i><b></b>to promote employment and support local enterprise, including measures in the area of business charges, local enterprise and business support arrangements, procurement support, local development and community-based initiatives, the Green Economy and participation in employment support schemes.  I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review, and am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p></reply>

The benefits of the reforms set out in the Action Programme will arise primarily in strengthening the local government system and improving effectiveness and value for money in the sector, particularly through more integrated administration, reduction of duplication, economies of scale, enhanced governance and oversight arrangements and a stronger role in promoting sustainable social, economic and community development.</p><p>  Significant savings will, however, be achieved through the overall reform programme, including the reform of local government structures and implementation of the recommendations of the Local Government Efficiency Review (LGER), local authority workforce planning and agency rationalisation. </p><p>  The County and City Managers' Association, in its input to the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Implementation Group (July 2013), identified total savings of &euro;839m since 2008, the beginning of the economic crisis.  In the period since the preparation of the LGER Report (2010) to end 2012, the savings achieved and projected are reported at &euro;561m.  This includes &euro;229m (already more than half the &euro;346m identified as potential direct efficiency savings in the LGER Report) attributed to efficiency measures (as opposed to reduction in activity) in the years 2010 to the end of 2012.  The majority of the efficiency savings identified relate to staffing reductions and procurement. </p><p>  Further savings are expected to be realised through other staffing and organisational rationalisation measures, including changes on foot of workforce planning and agency rationalisation, and a shared services approach across a number of programmes, particularly in relation to treasury management, transactional HR, shared payroll systems, procurement and ICT back office functions.</p></reply>

A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) is generally required before construction work is commenced in the case of a new apartment block, a new building other than a dwelling or an existing building undergoing an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use.  The FSC is issued by the Building Control Authority and certifies that the building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B (Fire Safety) of the Building Regulations. </p><p>  Section 5 of the Act of 1990 as amended also provides for a prohibition on the opening, occupation or use of a building which has not been granted, among other things, an FSC where such a certificate is required.  In this regard, article 43 of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 1997 to 2009 declares that the opening, operation or occupation of a new or existing building prior to the grant of an FSC, where required, or prior to the determination by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of an appeal on the matter, is an offence to which section 17(2) of the Act of 1990 refers, meaning that the offence, if successfully prosecuted in court, may result, on summary conviction, in a fine not exceeding &euro;800 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or, on conviction on indictment, in a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</p></reply>

Accumulations of FOG in wastewater treatment plants can give rise to pipe, equipment and plant blockages and impede treatment processes such as settlement and clarification, leading to increased maintenance and operational costs.  Blockages in combined sewers which collect sewage discharges (including trade effluent containing FOG ) and storm water can result in flooding and environmental pollution.   </p><p>  Under the Water Pollution Acts 1977 and 1990, businesses discharging to the public sewer require a valid trade effluent licence.  Local authorities grant trade effluent licences and are empowered to insert relevant conditions in such a licence.  This includes payment by the licence holders of fees determined by the local authority in relation to the costs of monitoring, treating and disposing of the trade effluents.  This is in accordance with the EU Water Framework Directive which requires full cost recovery from non-domestic users of water and wastewater services in accordance with the polluter pays principle.  The additional costs to the local authorities of dealing with FOG discharges are therefore levied on those responsible for those discharges.</p></reply>

In recent years local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges.  Local authorities have responded well to such requests and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.  I intend shortly to ask local authorities to again exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2014. </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group.  The Water Services (No. 2) Bill 2013, which I expect to publish shortly, will provide for the transfer of water services functions from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water.  The Bill will also provide for the establishment of an independent economic regulator for water services within the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  It is intended to provide in the Bill that non-domestic water charges and tariffs that are in place in each water services authority for 2013 will be carried over to 2014 pending the approval of new tariffs by the CER.

Given the current pressure on local authority income, it may not be financially viable for some local authorities to offer the incentives in question without unduly affecting the delivery of other services.</p><p>  The cost of administration of a scheme, such as the Business and Retail Incentive Scheme, would also need to be considered, including the merit of administering any such incentives through an existing financial support mechanism rather than creating a new mechanism (with consequential overheads) in the local authority system.  My Department issued updated guidance to local authorities earlier in 2013 on the issue of development contributions which requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that development contribution schemes include reduced or waived development contribution rates for developments in town centres to support town centre development. The guidelines have been issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 &ndash; 2012, and, accordingly, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to them in performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and specialist emergency and communications equipment as well as construction and upgrading of fire stations.   </p><p>  In 2010, the Galway City and Western Environs Fire Review Group was established to consider the fire cover in Galway City and Western Environs (South Connemara), as well as the West Connemara Area. The Group comprised representatives of Galway City Council, Galway County Council, the Chief Fire Officer for Galway City and County, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management and an external advisor from Strathclyde Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service.  The Group used a Risk Based Approach which had regard to the Risk Categorisation process as set out in <i>Keeping Communities Safe</i> (KCS). KCS was adopted as national policy in February 2013 and is based on a risk management approach, which addresses the critical elements of fire prevention, protection and response. It sets out an integrated approach to fire safety and fire services in Ireland which is in keeping with best international practice.   </p><p>  The Group finalised its review in June 2013. Having considered three years of actual fire incident data, potential changes in demographics and the various potential fire station permutations throughout the Western Environs Area, the Group concluded that there is not a conclusive case for an additional fire station. The Group did recommend a series of Community Fire Safety measures to further enhance the safety from fire of residents of the Area. I understand that a report on this matter has been made to both the City and County Councils. Under Section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1981, decision-making in regard to, inter alia, the organisation of fire services and fire stations is a reserved function of fire authorities and I therefore have no function in such decisions.     </p><p>  No application for capital funding assistance has been received by my Department for a new fire station in South Connemara. In assessing applications my Department has regard to the overall budgetary situation, national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, their priorities and the status of existing facilities, the extent of previous investment in fire services and the value for money offered by proposals.</p></reply>

RIA itself has no function in determining whether someone should stay or not in its accommodation. Its function is to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.</p><p>  The specific statistics sought by the Deputy are in the table below. It should be noted that the overall length of time taken to process cases to their finality is determined not just by the length of time taken to process the cases by the independent refugee determination bodies and by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) but also by the time needed to determine the outcome of any consequential legal proceedings taken by the applicant.</p><p>  INIS has no desire to have applicants remain in the system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  However, ultimately a balance has to be struck between maintaining the integrity of the State&rsquo;s protection and immigration systems and the case put forward by the individual applicant all of which must be considered within the legal requirements and obligations. In the first instance requirements are set-down in primary and secondary legislation and these requirements are constantly evolving taking into account interpretation of the law by the Courts at both national and EU level.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed. An amended Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I will introduce next year, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.</p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing,  I recently signed into law a Statutory Instrument to introduce new procedures for the processing of subsidiary protection applications by the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at first instance and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. <table><tr><th>Length of Time <br /><br />in RIA Accommodation <br /><br />(as at 1 November 2013)</th><th>Total</th><th>Percentage</th></tr><tr><td>0-3 months</td><td>242</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>3-6 months</td><td>178</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>6-9 months</td><td>160</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>9-12 months</td><td>208</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>12-18 months</td><td>273</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>18-24 months</td><td>312</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>2-3 years</td><td>402</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>3-4 years</td><td>468</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>4-5 years</td><td>545</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>5-6 years</td><td>602</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>6-7 years</td><td>485</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>7 + years</td><td>583</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>4,458</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></p><p>  There are some caveats in relation to the table above. Firstly, protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change.  In this table, up and including 2010 duration of stay was calculated by reference to the time that had elapsed since residents first made an application for international protection.  It does not necessarily mean that those persons have lived in RIA accommodation for all of that period.  Arising from the creation of a new database which allows for more detailed information, since 2011 duration of stay is calculated from the date of the latest entry into RIA accommodation, rather than from the initial protection application.  It does not include past time spent by residents who left the system for a period and subsequently sought and were granted re-access to the system.</p><p>  The budgetary provision for RIA in 2013 is &euro;57.5m and that will reduce to &euro;51.9m for 2014.  Detailed breakdowns of yearly expenditure for the years 2007 to 2012 inclusive are given in the Annual Reports for those years as published on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

No non-governmental organisations fall under the remit of my Department. </p><p>  In the context of the Deputy's question, State Agencies is taken to refer to statutory independent bodies which has a governance oversight responsibility for an organisation.

The Deputy will be aware that the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority are in the process of merging to form a new enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Authority Commission (IHREC) to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.  The Working Group that I established to advise me on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new Commission in its Report of April 2012 recommended that an independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing the new members.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.  </p><p>  In November 2012 advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media. The independent panel forwarded its recommendations of 14 names in March 2013. While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the  Government has appointed the 14 individuals as members of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year or 5 year basis to ensure that the term of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.    On 31 May 2013, I appointed 12 of their number to the board of the Equality Authority, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two bodies are dissolved.  </p><p>  A single fee of &euro;7,695 is payable to the 14 members designate of the IHREC, in respect of both organisations.

In that regard I am further informed that Garda data shows a decrease in burglaries in the Coolock and Raheny area, in line with the national trend.  As the Deputy may be aware the latest crime statistics show that the rate of burglary has decreased by 8.9% nationally for twelve months ending 30 June 2013 and this underlines the impact being made by Garda&iacute; under Operation Fiacla.  As part of the measures which are coordinated under Operation Fiacla, Operation Acer is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region, including Coolock and Raheny.  It is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led checkpoints and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders. These arrangements are kept under review to ensure adjustments are made to maintain the effective focus of the operation.</p><p>  Operation Acer operates alongside ongoing community policing measures, including problem solving with the community and ongoing liaison with schools, businesses and households in providing crime prevention advice and assistance to victims of burglary.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>In particular, I am advised that a recent crime prevention leaflet drop in the area has been well received in the community and that Community Police have also been in direct contact with the Kilbarrack/Foxfield Community Residents Association and attended a meeting with Kilbarrack residents in November 2013.  At this meeting Garda&iacute; provided crime prevention information and advice, particularly for elderly residents. There is also full engagement with local Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups in the area. </p><p>  Local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in the area to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

All Board services are governed by the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations. The Deputy should note that there has been a substantial increase in demand for civil legal aid services over recent years, which has meant that funding for the service has been maintained to a significant degree.  Furthermore, it should be noted that the figure for 2012 includes funding in respect of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure &euro; (m)</th></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>34.6</td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>32.2 </td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>30.4 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32.9</td></tr><tr><td>2013 (January to October) </td><td>27.1</td></tr></table></p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means. Under the Act, the grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, in certain circumstances, up to two counsel, in the preparation and conduct of their defence or appeal. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure &euro; (m)</th></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>60.3</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>56.5</td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>56.1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>50.5</td></tr><tr><td>2013 (January to October) </td><td>40.3 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

While in the community, a life sentenced prisoner will be on Reviewable Temporary Release under the supervision of the Probation Service.  Reviewable Temporary Release is where a prisoner is granted a specific period of temporary release from prison.  This can be at varying intervals, for example, weekly, monthly or annually.   The period of release is reviewed when the prisoner returns to prison and a decision is made whether to refuse or grant a further period of Reviewable Temporary Release.</p><p>  The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a Life Sentenced prisoner may present.  Where it is reported to the Irish Prison Service that the prisoner in the community is failing to abide by the conditions of their release, that person may be refused a further period of temporary release and be taken back into custody.  </p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may return a prisoner to prison where they are of the view that the prisoner is in breach of their temporary release conditions.  When this happens, the Governor will conduct an oral hearing into the allegation.  If the Governor is satisfied, taking into account evidence presented and comments made, that a breach of temporary release conditions has occurred the prisoner should be notified accordingly.  The Reviewable Temporary Release is then revoked and the prisoner is taken back into custody.</p></reply>

I propose to commence the Act shortly and, in this context, a number of draft regulations covering a wide range of issues are in the course of preparation to coincide with its commencement. </p><p>  With regard to the specific issue of the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails, the current legislation, the Protection of Animals Amendment Act (1965), allows tail docking for all dogs up to one month old by any person. I am currently examining draft regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 relating to this issue. It is my intention that as a general rule, tail docking of all dogs will be banned<i>, </i>except<i></i>in circumstances where the welfare of an animal is affected and, where it is permitted, it must be carried out either by a vet or veterinary nurse during the first four days. Veterinary practitioners will be required to make an assessment as to the necessity of carrying out this procedure given the individual animal&rsquo;s circumstances and taking account of current scientific knowledge when making this decision.  Nothing in the legislation will interfere with a veterinary practitioner&rsquo;s ability to undertake appropriate therapeutic operations in respect of injured animals.</p></reply>

Located at Killybegs, Rossaveal, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth the harbours are a valuable and vital resource to the Irish fishing fleet, associated service providers and the marine leisure and tourism sector. Business opportunities in this sector are facilitated by ongoing infrastructural maintenance and development of the Fishery Harbour Centres, largely enabled via my Department&rsquo;s annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. </p><p>  My Department has recently held public competitive tendering processes for vacant sites in three Fishery Harbour Centres namely Howth, Castletownbere and Killybegs and plans with regard to potential future uses for vacant properties at the Fishery Harbour Centres are kept under ongoing review by my Department.  In addition, a targeted range of supports for the development of the seafood sector are available through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  Some of the schemes of particular relevance to seafood processing businesses wishing to expand and grow their business are the Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme, Seafood Value Adding Scheme and the Graduate Placement Scheme. Grants of up to 30% of eligible investment costs are available under the Processing Scheme.  I announced grant awards totalling &euro;2.3 million under this Scheme in 2013.  A budget of &euro;3 million is available to BIM for this Scheme in 2014.  </p><p>  The Fisheries Local Area Development Scheme will also be of interest to small businesses or start-ups in the wider seafood economy.  BIM administer this Scheme, while the six Fisheries Local Action Groups located around our coast select projects for funding.  Grant support of up to 40% is available under this Scheme.  Additional supports for small businesses are provided by Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the agencies under its aegis.</p></reply>

Issues relating to control of scrub and rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping. Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps scrub and rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  </p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas/features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land with scrub or rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC. My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of scrub and rushes since the issue has to be seen in this broader context.</p><p>  Finally, it should be remembered that there is a comprehensive appeal system in place for applicants to avail of if they consider that an inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements or if they are unhappy with the inspection findings. This appeal system incorporates an initial review by an officer more senior than the inspecting officer, with the option to appeal the outcome of any such review to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and the appeals committee chaired by Padraig Gibbons. In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of this review he/she has the right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Horses not identified within the prescribed period are ineligible for slaughter for human consumption.</p><p>  It is not open to me to provide an amnesty to horse owners in respect of the foregoing legislative provisions.  It is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the horses in their ownership and/or their care are correctly identified, that the welfare of their horses is not compromised and to dispose of them appropriately.  In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which is was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal, in a humane way.</p><p>  My Department is monitoring the horse welfare situation on farms and I have indicated that emergency funding will be provided to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal.  Farmers who are facing a critical horse welfare issue over coming months can contact the Department helpline for assistance.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.</p><p>  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law. Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food. They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied. In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output. This is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;one step forward one step backward&rdquo; traceability system.</p><p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials.</p><p>  Food labelling used to inform consumers of the properties of pre-packaged food is governed by harmonised EU rules. My colleague, the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for general food labelling legislation but my Department plays an important role in the labelling of food together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). The FSAI has published guidelines which provide an overview of the legislative requirements for the documentation and labelling of all meats including beef and I understand that this material is currently under review.</p><p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products are laid down in EU legislation. For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.</p><p>  In 2011, the European Union passed a new Council Regulation on Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169/2011, which has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas including;</p><p>- country of origin or place of provenance including the origin labelling for meats other than beef (that is swine, sheep, goats and poultry),</p><p>- voluntary labelling of all foods and</p><p>- the mandatory labelling of meat as an ingredient.</p><p>  These requirements will have to be implemented by way of EU Commission implementing regulations and it is expected that draft EU Commission proposal currently being discussed at working group level will be voted on by 13   December 2013. Any new regulations will come into force on 1 April 2015.</p></reply>

In this context, the centralisation of administrative functions in the local offices to two centres fits in both with my Department&rsquo;s objectives in driving efficiency and savings and also with the broad public service reform agenda. It will enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services and, at the same time, it will facilitate the re-deployment of staff from the local offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services more efficiently through these agencies.</p><p>  I should emphasise that the centralisation of administrative functions will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers, along with appropriate administrative support, will remain in place in the Roscommon office to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from this office.</p><p>  In view of the foregoing, I do not intend to alter my decision to centralise the administrative functions in the regional offices.</p></reply>

If no adoption took place the Authority would not have an adoption file. Where no adoption took place, if records exist they may be held by a number of sources including hospitals, GPs, Mother and Baby Homes, religious orders and other sources. A large number of these files are being transferred to the HSE.</p><p>  The HSE provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families. The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the HSE. Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, which had responsibility for Bessboro, Co Cork; Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, Co Tipperary; and Castlepollard, Co Westmeath.   Work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place and the HSE is anxious to preserve the integrity of these records.  The HSE has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files that are of great significance.</p><p>  The HSE also has records that include those for St. Anne&rsquo;s Adoption Society; St Mary&rsquo;s Adoption Society, Kerry;  Ard Mhuire, Dunboyne, Co Meath; Limerick Catholic Adoption Society;  St Patrick's Mother and Baby Home Navan Road, Dublin; St Louise's Adoption Society Dublin; Dublin Health Authority Board of Assistance; Rotunda Girls Aid Society; the Ossory Kilkenny Adoption Society;  St Kevin's and St Johns Adoption Societies.  The HSE is also in negotiation regarding files from Holles Street, St Brigid's, and St Patrick Guild. Furthermore PACT, who are an agency accredited under the Act, have records of various Protestant organisations. A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations,  is available on the HSE website.</p><p>  The HSE Information and Tracing Service recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and has put in place a plan to redistribute records from individual institutions in their entirety,  to the various adoption teams around the country,  in a concerted effort to reduce waiting times. The HSE is in the process of reorganising the information and tracing system to allocate social work resources country wide in a way that will allow for reduced waiting times across the country. The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland  or the HSE Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The HSE is working to provide a more streamlined  service and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible.</p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register which is operated by the Adoption Authority was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the  Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.</p><p>  I have no plans to initiate an audit of all files in this regard.</p></reply>

While it is important to acknowledge that in some cases, disappointing deficiencies in practice are highlighted, it is also important to acknowledge that case work has improved.  Managers and front line professional staff are more aware of the importance of recognising and responding to neglect while making sure that the long term impact on the future health and well being of a child  is also recognised and responded to with good quality services.</p><p>  Key themes emerging from the reports include the importance of prioritisation and good assessment of referrals, working with young people who are resistant to being helped, suicide prevention and early intervention for children experiencing neglect.  The HSE has commenced a process of sharing the learning from these case reviews with its frontline staff, together with learnings from the initial phases of the audit of neglect files.  As a consequence of learning from these and similar cases, managers and staff are instructed to make sure they build close working relationships with colleagues in other disciplines and agencies to support vulnerable young people such as those featured in these reports.</p><p>  There exists now a significant opportunity in bringing together a multi-disciplinary team in the formation of the Child and Family Agency to respond in a more cohesive and coordinated way to the needs of children and young people who present with complex issues which need to be responded to by a range of agencies and disciplines working across sectors.  Strong interagency arrangements between the new Child and Family Agency and the HSE will continue to be vital and protocols are already in development in anticipation of the establishment of the new Agency.</p><p>  I also intend to strengthen the operation of the National Review Panel by asking HIQA to undertake an audit/oversight role in relation to the processes of the Panel.  HIQA are agreed in principle to take on this oversight role and discussions are ongoing in relation to the detail.</p></reply>

These Regulations are supported by explanatory notes which offer guidance and assist in interpreting the regulations.  New National Quality Standards, which will replace the explanatory notes and which will set out the outcomes and supporting criteria against which the quality of childcare services will be measured, will be launched shortly.</p><p>  My Department is currently progressing the Pre-School Quality Agenda and a number of key areas have been identified which will require reform with the objective of improving the quality of childcare services. The amendments to underpin these reforms are part of the legislative process for the establishment next year of the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>  Legislation to strengthen the current inspection regime is expected to be enacted before the end of the year.  This will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level. Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with and the threat of removal of registration will be available. This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration.</p><p>  I am introducing new qualification requirements for staff delivering childcare in the pre-school sector.  The current minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year  under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will be increased to Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  This requirement will be effective from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services. The new legislative amendments to provide for this change are also being progressed.</p></reply>

The Authority has travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities, advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries. The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and obtain up-to-date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries.</p><p>  In relation to intercountry adoption with Bulgaria the AAI has advised me that referrals for the adoption of Bulgarian children by Irish applicants have commenced.</p><p>  In September 2012 the Adoption Authority and the Vietnamese Central Authority for Adoption signed an administrative arrangement for intercountry adoption. The administrative arrangement is the first international arrangement for intercountry adoption entered into by the AAI and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since both countries ratified the Hague Convention.   The Adoption Authority accredited Helping Hands for activities in relation to facilitating adoptions from Vietnam and Helping Hands has received confirmation from the Vietnamese authorities of its approval to operate there.  Helping Hands has advised that they expect adoptions to commence shortly.</p><p>  The administrative arrangement in relation to intercountry adoption from the USA has been given effect. Pending the delegation of functions to an Irish based accredited body working in the USA, the Authority will continue to send Article 15 assessment reports to US adoption service providers.</p><p>  During a visit to India in March of this year   I was advised that registration is open with CARA for special needs cases; this includes children with intellectual or physical disabilities, siblings including twins, and children over 5 years of age.  It was explained that India currently operates intercountry adoption with other Hague countries without the need for any specific administrative agreements of the type envisaged in Article 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. The Adoption Authority has advised that it is their view that a registered accredited body to facilitate intercountry adoption is necessary.  The AAI will consider any applications it receives in this regard.</p><p>  Work has also been undertaken in terms of agreements on adoption from non-Hague countries. Russia and Ethiopia are not signatories of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. As such, future adoptions from Russia and Ethiopia would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and these countries.</p><p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to a possible  bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Russia. In October a delegation of Russian officials travelled to Ireland for detailed discussions  with officials from my Department, the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the HSE. At the meeting significant progress was made and my Department has committed to reverting to the Russian side in the coming weeks with further detailed proposals in an effort to address both Russian and  Irish legal and administrative requirements to the greatest degree possible.</p><p>  The Adoption Authority delegation visit to Ethiopia in April of 2012 was an initial part of the Authority's deliberations on the feasibility and suitability of entering into discussions with Ethiopia on a bilateral adoption agreement. The Authority is considering the legal advice received on the compatibility of Irish and Ethiopian adoption law and will advise me of the position when all the information is available.</p><p>  As intercountry adoption is a constantly changing landscape, the most up to date information on individual countries can be found on the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie).</p></reply>

This support has included the provision of annual funding to a number of voluntary childcare organisations.  These include:</p><p>- Early Childhood Ireland (formerly the National Children's Nurseries Association and the Irish Preschool Play Association)</p><p>- Barnardos</p><p>- Irish Steiner Waldorf Early Childhood Association</p><p>- Forbairt Naionrai Teoranta</p><p>- Border Counties Childcare Network</p><p>- St Nicholas Montessori Association and</p><p>- Childminding Ireland</p><p>These are voluntary organisations which, <i>inter alia</i>, provide training and quality supports to their members.</p><p>  As part of my Pre-School Quality Agenda, I will be introducing new qualification requirements for childcare workers.  All staff caring for children in a pre-school service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of FETAC Level 5, while pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  These requirements will come into effect from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.</p><p>  In the light of these timeframes, my Department has sought to work with the childcare sector to accelerate the process for training and upskilling its staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  It is recommended that to achieve the required qualifications in the limited time period, staff in the sector, who are on modest pay should not have to pay the full cost of accredited training from their own resources.</p><p>  In this context, Early Childhood Ireland, which is the largest of the voluntary childcare organisations funded by my Department, has been asked as part of its 2013 workplan to offer additional training to the existing childcare workforce, in relevant Level 5 and 6 training modules.  This training has commenced and I understand that 13 training courses are currently being delivered.  It is anticipated that up to 600 childcare staff will access courses leading to the higher qualification.  Additional grant funding will be made available to ECI in 2013 to provide for this.</p><p>  Early Childhood Ireland is a limited company with charitable status.  It represents a significant number of the childcare facilities whose staff will benefit from the training initiative.  ECI has a proven record in delivering quality training to its members, and is a registered FETAC/QQI centre with full Quality Assurance status.  Processes, policies and procedures are in place to ensure fair and consistent assessment of learners.  This process is continually reviewed through self-evaluation, and is monitored by FETAC/QQI.</p></reply>

All are located on the same campus at Oberstown, near Lusk, Co. Dublin.  These schools currently accommodate girls under 18 years of age and boys under 17 whose detention is ordered by the Courts on remand or on conviction for criminal offences.</p><p>  The current legal detention capacity on the Oberstown campus comprises 24 male detention places in Trinity House School, 8 female detention places in Oberstown Girls School, and 22 male detention places in Oberstown Boys School. In the latter case, this was increased from 20 detention places with effect from 1 October 2013.  However, only 16 of the certified 24 male places in Trinity House School are currently available.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, which is based in my Department, is currently in discussions with management, staff and unions on the Oberstown campus on initiatives to reconfigure the detention places and staff resources, in order to address the increased demand for male detention places from the courts.  </p><p>  There were a small number of places available at most times in all 3 children detention schools in the period November 2011-February 2013.  However, since March 2013, the occupancy of Trinity House School and Oberstown Boys School has been at maximum on most occasions, due to the high level of demand from the courts for male detention places.  This has meant that any places that become available have been reallocated within a short period of time.  Based on daily occupancy reports from the Irish Youth Justice Service in the period 1 March - 25 November 2013, it is estimated that there were 108 days where there was a male detention place available in either Trinity House School or Oberstown Boys School.  On most other days, both sites were at maximum occupancy and no further places were available.  This estimate excludes weekends and public holidays.  In the case of Oberstown Girls School, there have been no issues relating to a shortage of female detention places in the past 2 years.</p><p>  There is daily coordination between the 24 hour on - call bed management service operated by the Irish Youth Justice Service for the Oberstown campus, the Probation Service, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts.  Updated information is available at any time on the occupancy level in Oberstown.  There are long standing arrangements whereby the other stakeholders involved cooperate with this system and enquiries received may relate to either the general availability of detention places or the availability of a place for a particular young person.  It is also important to note that while both Trinity House School and Oberstown Boys School are operating at maximum capacity on most occasions at present, there is still a service being provided for a significant number of young people in contact with the criminal justice system. There were 23 boys in detention on committal orders on 1st March 2013 and there were 12 boys on remand orders on the same date. I am advised that in the period 1 March - 25 November 2013, there were a total of 88<b></b>boys remanded in custody and 29 boys committed to a period of detention to either Trinity House School or Oberstown Boys School.</p><p>  In terms of the overall capacity of the Oberstown site, I have recently confirmed that a main contractor and a number of sub-contractors have now been appointed to the Oberstown development project and construction of the new facilities started on site on 23 September 2013.  On 14 October 2013 I officially launched the construction project with the event taking place on the campus in Oberstown.</p><p>  The timeline for the project will see the first three new residential units available in the third quarter of 2014, which will be used to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities (currently St. Patrick's Institution) to the Oberstown campus and will deliver on the Government's commitment to end the practice of detaining children in St. Patrick's Institution.  An additional three residential units, to be delivered in 2015, will be used to replace existing accommodation on the Oberstown campus which has reached the end of its useful life.  The development will also provide associated education, recreation, security and other ancillary facilities and will result in all detention services for children being delivered in a single location, maximising the scope for ensuring best practice standards using the children detention school model and for operational efficiency.  The project is due to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-11-26a.1290.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013112600077#WRY01700"><p>The prices of drugs vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels. </p><p>  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including</p><p>  -	significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs,</p><p>  -	a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, </p><p>  -	timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and</p><p>  -	reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement. 	The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicines on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of the top 20 priority medicines by mid- 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013.  Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

It is premature to speculate on the amount of capital, if any, that might be required by the VHI.  It is currently preparing an application to the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) for authorisation. The CBI will determine the level of any capital requirement as part of its assessment of VHI&rsquo;s financial position and readiness for authorisation.</p><p>  If Exchequer assistance is required, a separate Government Decision will be taken at the appropriate time.  Subject to Government approval, any capital injection would be expected to be in the form of a repayable loan at market interest rates and would come from general Exchequer funding, not from the health budget.  Any such capitalisation would also require the approval of the European Commission under State Aid rules.  I will be bringing proposals to Government very shortly regarding the VHI and authorisation and will also continue to engage with the EU Commission on the matter.</p></reply>

This was transposed by the European Union (Quality and Safety of Human Organs Intended for Transplantation) Regulations, S.I. No. 325 of 2012.  The Regulations apply to donation, procurement, testing, characterisation, transport and transplantation of organs.  They set out a clear legal framework for the application of quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation.  The Regulations, however, do not specify who should or should not be donors, but state that selection assessments carried out pursuant to the regulations may provide for the exclusion of persons whose donation could present unacceptable health risks. </p><p>  For transplantation to proceed safely, all potential donors are risk assessed, in line with international practice, in order to prevent inadvertent transmission of infection. All potential donors, or, in the case of deceased donors, their next of kin, must answer a range of questions prior to the organ donation process proceeding.  These include questions in relation to certain  risk behaviours.  A decision on whether someone who is gay may become a donor is not based on sexual orientation.  However, it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates among MSM in Ireland and this could influence decisions on organ donation.  While testing for HIV is sensitive and effective, there remains a period between infection and detection for which allowance has to be made in deciding on acceptability for organ donation.</p></reply>

That is a more problematic proposal given that providers have a very clear vested and commercial interest in decisions that may be made. While those interests are entirely legitimate, the Deputy will understand the need to maintain the independence and impartiality of the decision-making process, and a Forum of the type proposed is not therefore something that would be appropriate.

The HSE&rsquo;s Internal Audit Directorate undertook a detailed review of remuneration in these agencies. These are voluntary hospitals and disability organisations and the audit does not relate to employees of the HSE.  This review was concluded in March 2013 and identified a significant number of cases in which senior personnel were in receipt of additional payments outside the terms of the approved pay scales.</p><p>  Arising from a number of individual cases in which it was found that staff of Section 38-funded organisations were in receipt of salaries above approved rates, the Department of Health had, on a number of occasions between 2008 and 2011, drawn the attention of the HSE to the need to ensure compliance in this regard.  While the HSE took the matter up with the organisations concerned, it is clear from the results of the more recent and intensive HSE Internal Audit exercise that a range of practices remained in force which were at variance with approved salary scales.  </p><p>  On 27 September 2013 my Department issued a pay policy, prepared following consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to the HSE.  This policy, which reflects Government policy on senior public service pay generally, makes it clear that bodies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 may not supplement approved rates of remuneration with either Exchequer funding or non-Exchequer sources of funding.  The pay policy makes clear that if an organisation wishes to make a business case for the continuation of an unapproved allowance, it is open to it to do so and that any such cases will be considered by the HSE (with the involvement of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as necessary).  A business case must also be made for the continued payment of allowances which are not encompassed by or in line with the Department of Health Consolidated Salary Scales but which may have been sanctioned in the past.  </p><p>  The HSE has written to each of the service providers concerned, providing them with the pay policy and seeking confirmation that remuneration arrangements are in full compliance with it.   The vast majority of organisations have now responded to the HSE.  The HSE will examine in detail the responses received and address any issue arising with the organisations concerned. The HSE&rsquo;s approach will involve a robust process of verification and, as necessary, clarification of the position in each Section 38 organisation.  In these circumstances I do not consider it appropriate that I should comment on the position in any individual organisation at this time.</p></reply>

There are no plans to alter these arrangements.</p><p>  The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.  A major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) in October 2012.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including:</p><p>  - significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs;</p><p>  - a lowering of the drugs bill to the State;</p><p>  - timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions; and</p><p>  - reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.</p><p>The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nine EU member states.  The prices of a range of medicines were reduced on 1 January 2013 in accordance with the agreement. 	The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400 million over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will be available to fund new drugs.</p><p>  A new agreement was also reached with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic drugs industry.  Since 1 November 2012, the HSE only reimburses generic products which are priced at 50% or less of the initial price of an originator medicine. This represents a significant structural change in generic drug pricing and should lead to an increase in the generic prescribing rate. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicines on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the top 20 priority medicines by mid- 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed.</p><p>  Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.  Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

However,  the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card in certain circumstances. Medical card applicants who are unsuccessful following the means assessment, but who indicate that they suffer from a medical condition, are then referred to the Medical Officer for consideration on a medical discretionary basis.</p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made in 2014, when the specifics of the legislation are known.  </p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.</p></reply>

Both the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills are ensuring that those affected receive tailored assistance to address their individual needs.</p><p>  The health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed  have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.</p><p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in last June. Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years. The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.</p><p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education for pupils with special needs. </p><p>   The HSE Advocacy Unit is in regular contact with individuals affected and regularly meet representatives of the SOUND (sufferers of unique narcolepsy disorder), the last meeting was held in August 2013.  I have also met with representatives of SOUND on two occasions to discuss their needs.  Furthermore the Chief Medical Officer and officials from my Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills have met with SOUND a number of times, including yesterday to address issues of concern.  </p><p>  All health and educational services and supports are provided on a needs basis and are reassessed on an on-going basis to take account of changes in the individuals condition and circumstances.</p></reply>

Under paragraph 27 of the GMS contract, a medical practitioner shall not demand or accept any payment or consideration whatsoever in reward for services provided by him/her, or for travelling or for other expenses incurred by him/her or for the use of any premises, equipment or instruments in making the services available.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either (a) assist in the process of diagnosing a patient or (b) monitor a diagnosed condition, the GP may not charge that patient if they are eligible for free GMS services under the Health Act, 1970, as amended.  </p><p>  In 2011, the HSE wrote to GP contract holders to clarify the position in relation to this matter.  The HSE has also communicated its position to the Irish Medical Organisation.  Any alleged instances of eligible patients being requested to pay for a routine service of this nature from their own limited resources is viewed as a serious matter by the HSE and the Department.  </p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that its Local Health Offices will fully investigate any reported incidents of eligible patients being charged for phlebotomy services which form part of the investigation and necessary treatment of patients' symptoms or conditions.  In such cases, where a medical card holder or a GP visit card holder has been inappropriately charged for the taking of blood, the HSE will make deductions from those GPs' routine GMS payments.  Since July 2012, the HSE has made deductions from 7 GPs' GMS payments, where it determined that the GPs in question had inappropriately charged patients for phlebotomy services (3 in Dublin, 3 in Kilkenny and 1 in Wexford).</p><p>  The HSE is also continuing to advise eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services, to seek a refund from the GP in question.    It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new GP contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p></reply>

Under UHI, everyone will be insured with their choice of insurer and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy.</p><p>  Intensive work is currently underway on the preparation of a <i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance</i>   which will provide more detail on the UHI model for Ireland. Drafting is at an advanced stage with a view to publishing the White Paper by the end of this year.  The health reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years and full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. I anticipate that by 2016 the necessary groundwork will be in place to enable us to phase in implementation of UHI, as promised in the Programme for Government. I should add that it is my intention to consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.</p></reply>

The Model, which is evidence based and clinically acceptable, is the result of an extensive consultation process and agreed by the relevant stakeholders.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.    </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Donegal County Council applied to the Department in 2010 for funding under the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme for funds for the Cockhill Bridge Scheme. The projected cost of the project was &euro;2.95m. Given the costs associated with the project it was not possible to approve this application and no further formal funding application has been received by my Department.</p><p>  Given the need to prioritise funding for repair and strengthening works, the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme is being suspended in 2014. While provision may continue to be made for bridge repair and rehabilitation works I understand that the Cockhill Bridge proposal as submitted in 2010 would be outside the scope of such works as it involves major widening works.  It is important to reiterate that the role of the Exchequer grant aid is to supplement Councils' own resource spending on regional and local roads. I will announce the 2014 regional and local road grant allocations early in 2014.</p></reply>

The Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of the Department processed in excess of 2.56 million motor tax applications with a value of &euro;533 million in 2012, through the online motor tax website, , these fees were then paid into the Local Government Fund. This represented 50% of overall motor tax receipts.</p><p>  Under the merchant agreement, an average financial charge of 1% of the tax payment is applied to payments made through credit cards, while debit card payments are charged a flat fee of 23 cent each, irrespective of the value of the transaction. The total value of these charges in 2012 was &euro;3.07 million. These charges, along with all charges incurred by the Department in collecting motor tax, are refunded to the Department from the Local Government Fund.  </p><p>  The Mercantile Marine Office (MMO) accepts payments by debit and credit card (and by other methods of payment) for services provided under the Merchant Shipping and Wireless Telegraphy Acts. The total fee revenue transferred to the Exchequer in 2012 was &euro;500,000, of which &euro;169,053.43 related to debit and credit card transactions.  The financial charges involved vary for different credit and debit cards. For base card charges, the charges vary from 1.154% to 1.754% or a per transaction charge of between 16 cent and 21 cent. Premium cards incur an additional charge of 0.6%.  The MMO does not pass on the cost of debit and credit card transactions to the public.  The Road Transport Operator Licensing Unit of the Department is also preparing to introduce electronic payments by debit or credit card in the near future. </p><p>  The charges incurred by the agencies under the Department's responsibility are a matter for the agencies themselves and I am forwarding the Deputy's question to them for a direct response to him. If the Deputy does not receive a response within ten working days, he should please contact my private office.  It is important to note that while there are costs associated with payments through debit/credit cards, there are also significant costs for the Department and members of the public when paying through cash.</p></reply>

Since its establishment in 2001, the Authority has been funded through a combination of Exchequer funds and revenue provided from its activities, such as the NCT. Its dependence on Exchequer funds has reduced over the years and, in 2013, only 12% of overall income comes from the Exchequer. It is my aim to make the RSA self funding at the earliest possible date.</p><p>  As part of the Service Level Agreement between my Department and the RSA, the Authority's capital programme requirements for 2013 was agreed at &euro;22.5 million. Under the terms of the Agreement, if the Authority exceeds its revenue reserve threshold of &euro;22.5 million, an equivalent adjustment will be made in the amount drawn down from the Exchequer.

Most bridge strikes occur on rail over road bridges which are owned by Irish Rail.  The impact of bridge strikes has been raised with road haulage representative bodies in the context of the recent termination of the derogation on vehicle heights. The Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008  provide that with effect from November 1st, 2013 the maximum operating height for all vehicles in Ireland is 4.65 metres unless otherwise permitted by law. Furthermore, road traffic legislation provides that bridge strikes incur a mandatory court appearance and on summary conviction a person is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 and three penalty points. Where the offence is tried on indictment a person convicted of the offence is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 and a term of imprisonment not exceeding 3 years or both may be imposed.   </p><p>  I have referred your correspondence to Irish Rail and the National Roads Authority for direct response.

Separately, legislative proposals are being developed by my Department which will permit certain agricultural vehicles to operate at higher weights, and which may result in such vehicles being subject to roadworthiness testing. The testing frequency will be decided in the light of the technical requirements recommended by the Road Safety Authority (RSA). </p><p>  As in all cases, responsibility for the practical arrangements of roadworthiness testing of vehicles is a matter for the RSA.  In 2008, the RSA commenced a consultation and review of the regulation, classification and safety issues surrounding the use of agricultural and related works vehicles on public roads.  Their report, delivered in March 2009, contained a number of recommendations for dealing with the issue.  Following Ministerial approval in principle of the recommendations, extensive consultations were held with the RSA, the IFA , the Professional Agricultural Contractors of Ireland (PACI) and the IRHA.</p><p>  In the wake of these extensive consultations, a number of road safety related proposals were formulated  by the RSA and agreed by the Minister in November 2012. Depending on the number of axles, axle spacing, and type of coupling, agricultural vehicles will be able to draw up to 28 tonnes. In view of the increase in safety risk associated with the larger and heavier vehicles using the public road, tractors and trailers operating at the higher weights would be subject to roadworthiness testing. The proposed arrangements also regulate axle spacing, vehicle and trailer plating, lighting and visibility, braking and coupling, driving licences, on-road behaviour, accident reporting, roadworthiness testing and enforcement. </p><p>  The draft Statutory Instrument to give legislative effect to the Minister&rsquo;s road safety related decisions is being prepared by the RSA and will be submitted to the Department shortly.</p></reply>

Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has indicated that it is in the process of implementing new energy saving fleet utilisation initiatives on its DART and Intercity services to generate fuel savings, which will reduce fuel and maintenance costs by &euro;3.2m per annum. Concerns about overcrowding have been raised with the Chief Executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I understand that the company has already responded and re-introduced larger carriages to accommodate passengers where this has been considered necessary.  The Chief Executive has agreed to continuous monitoring of carriage levels on both DART and Intercity services to ensure they match passenger demand.  It should be noted that carriages were only reduced at off-peak times. Overcrowding which has occurred at peak times was caused by other issues including technical faults, industrial relations and leaf falls.</p></reply>

Both Minister Kelly and I met with trade unions representing workers in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann last week in relation to the proposals outlined by the NTA in the recent consultation process.  </p><p>  It is recognised that there are a number of concerns in relation to potential tendering for PSO services.  These include the impact on industrial relations and cost savings measures within CIE at a general level and the specific implications of Transfer of Undertakings legislation  (TUPE)  and related issues.  However, it must be recognised that the proposals outlined in the consultation process are relatively modest and there will be a long-lead in before any tendering takes effect. Furthermore, it is of course open to the two incumbent companies to compete for any tendered routes, so it should not be assumed that there will be any reductions in staff numbers or that TUPE will even arise.</p><p>  Subject to the decision of the NTA  following its consultation processes, these issues need to be addressed by it and the bus companies through constructive engagement with the unions in the course of the procurement process over the next two years. I undertook to the trade unions at our meeting that I would contact the NTA to seek to have such a structured engagement put in place.</p></reply>

It is open to any Member State to introduce road use charges if it wishes. Road charging is an important option in relation to funding of roads infrastructure, particularly in the context of ensuring that out of state hauliers contribute to the costs of a country&rsquo;s road infrastructure.  In respect of the United Kingdom's introduction of road charging, I have been in contact with my counterpart in the United Kingdom, both in response to the initial public consultation and more recently, to point out the difficulties this will create for Republic of Ireland hauliers - especially those based in the border area. Furthermore, I asked that the contribution made to date, and planned future contribution, by the Government towards roads infrastructure costs in Northern Ireland (namely in relation to the A5 in Northern Ireland) should be taken into account and some provision therefore be made in relation use of roads by Irish-registered HGVs.  The UK Minister has responded, indicating a willingness to consider certain, regional cross-border specified roads in Northern Ireland. He has not proposed inclusion of the A5. However I have not yet received any formal proposal from the Minister in this regard. </p><p>  My officials continue to liaise with their UK counterparts on this issue. Any influence that the Deputy can bring to bear on the UK authorities through his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive would of course be welcome. </p></reply>
