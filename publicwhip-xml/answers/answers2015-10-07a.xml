    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-07a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100700068#WRA00500"><p>My Department recognises that controlled burning, properly planned and properly carried out, has a role to play in land management. This role is not just with regard to land-eligibility, but it can also play a beneficial role with regard to habitat conservation and enhancement.    In particular, burning has traditionally been used to help manage land in upland areas and is one of the means by which these important habitats were created in the first place, followed by a balanced grazing regime. In more recent times, however, much of the knowledge of how and when to burn land correctly has been lost as the farming activity on these upland zones decreased. Most of these areas are commonages, and many are now seriously under-grazed, which has had a detrimental effect on both land eligibility and biodiversity. </p>  <p>  Under GLAS, one of our main objectives is to restore these uplands to agricultural and environmental health. To do that, we have created a specific measure within the new scheme that encourages shareholders on commonages to come together and draw up a new Commonage Management Plan with the help of a trained GLAS commonage advisor. The main component of this plan is a new grazing regime on every commonage, which is tailored to the needs of that commonage, and to which each shareholder must now commit and contribute. Within that plan we have also provided for the possibility of supplementary actions, including controlled burning. If that is to form part of the new management regime, it must be planned properly and carried out in strict accordance with the relevant legislation. Where burning takes place in full compliance with these requirements, there is no issue in relation to land eligibility. </p>  <p>The Guide to Land Eligibility, which issued to farmers this spring, makes this quite clear when it states as follows: "Where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for grazing or cultivation and therefore is not eligible. The exception to this is where controlled burning is carried out in full compliance with all relevant environmental legislative requirements and any other lawful requirements, having first consulted with and notified the Garda&iacute; and the local fire service. In the case of Natura lands (lands designated as SAC and/or SPA), prior approval must be obtained through the Activities Requiring Consent (ARC) system as implemented by NPWS."</p></reply>

This is why my Department and its agencies have developed a series of innovative measures including Origin Green and the Carbon Navigator initiative to drive sustainability in the sector.  Sustainability and climate change measures are also key elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing its sectorial contribution to the National Mitigation Plan, which will examine how the sector can play its part in addressing the current 2020 compliance challenge and will look out to 2030 and beyond. </p>  <p>  The recently launched agri-food strategy, Food Wise 2025, sets a course for the agri-food industry of more sustainable growth over the next decade.   An environmental analysis was developed in tandem with this strategy and the final report will be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  Ireland sees agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU) greenhouse mitigation policy as intrinsically linked in an integrated land-use approach. Our major commitment to investment in the Forestry Programme will yield a very significant level of mitigation to 2020 and beyond. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to assess the potential of bioenergy from the agriculture and forestry sectors to contribute to the 2020 renewable energy targets.</p>  <p>  In terms of research and its contribution to the environmentally sustainable development of the agri-food sector; my Department provides a core grant to Teagasc, and operates competitive funding programmes for &lsquo;public good&rsquo; type agri-food research, namely Stimulus and FIRM. A recurring research priority is the greenhouse gas efficiency of Irish agricultural production systems so as to maintain our economic and environmental competitive advantages.</p></reply>

Taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture, as evidenced by our cooperation on the &lsquo;Agri-taxation Review&rsquo;, which was published as part of Budget 2015.</p>  <p>  The Agri-taxation Review is a comprehensive taxation strategy for the sector and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture was evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of its recommendations. Of course it was not possible to implement all of the recommendations in one budget. My Department and I have been engaged with the Department of Finance on the outstanding recommendations from the Review and other taxation matters, including those raised by the farming organisations, which are being considered in the context of Budget 2016.</p>  <p>  In relation to expenditure,  my intention is to ensure that all resources available to my Department will be managed to provide the optimum economic benefit to the agri-food sector in terms of realising its future potential.  Expenditure so far this year is in line with profiles and it is expected that this will continue over the remaining quarter.  </p>  <p>  As a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities, Ireland will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets:</p>  <p>- Direct payments provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility. The measures in the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme will provide vital support through farm investment, agri-environment and knowledge transfer schemes.</p>  <p>- The package introduced by the EU Commission recently to address difficulties in the dairy and pigmeat sectors reflects the majority of the demands I presented to them. The concession made by the Commission to allow advance payments of 70% under the direct payments scheme and 85% for rural development schemes, which will be of major benefit in easing the cash flow of farmers.</p>  <p>- Income averaging for farmers, extended in last year&rsquo;s Budget from 3 to 5 years, allows a smoothing of the tax liability in any given year to balance out fluctuations in commodity prices. </p>  <p>- I have regular meetings with the CEOs of the main banks, and I know that all are aware of the difficulties in prices this year, and are planning accordingly in terms of managing loans.</p>  <p>  With regard to future prospects, Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July this year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy, with detailed recommendations, which will allow the sector to grow and prosper.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-07a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100700068#WRA01100"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the first tranche of GLAS proved hugely successful attracting nearly 27,000 applications in all. Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage.  On the basis of the plans submitted for the 27,000 applications received to date, we have already met or exceeded RDP targets for Low Input Permanent Pasture, Protection of Watercourses, Laying Hedgerows, Planting New Hedgerows, Planting of Traditional Orchards, Bird, Bee and Bat Habitats, Wild Bird Cover and Stone Wall Maintenance.   </p>  <p>  For the second tranche of GLAS, which I intend to launch next week, I have revisited the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche. Not all the actions which have met or exceeded targets require to be adjusted, given that the associated spend is in many cases relatively easily accommodated in within the total budget. </p>  <p>  However, given the very high uptake of Low Input Permanent Pasture (LIPP), it is proposed to adjust the provision for this action under the next tranche. It will still be possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component will be limited to 5 hectares. While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will encourage more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare. </p>  <p>  In relation to the planting of new hedgerows, I am proposing to suspend this action for Tranche 2, along with the planting of traditional orchards. Both actions have met their targets for the entire RDP, and there are concerns about the availability of planting stock. I will, however, review this for Tranche 3. I am also reducing slightly the maximum length for coppicing from 1000 metres to 750 metres. This action is well on target and if possible I would like to encourage farmers to continue to take up the hedge-laying option which has already proved very popular. </p>  <p>  On birds, and following discussion with farmer representatives, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Bird Watch Ireland, I am proposing a number of changes which will make it easier for farmers to adapt to the new regimes required, and which will encourage even greater uptake. </p>  <p>  For Natura land, I am providing for part-parcel actions, combined with compatible actions on the remaining part-parcel. Again, this follows discussions with farmer representative and other stakeholders and will provide for greater flexibility. </p>  <p>  On protection of watercourses, I am also providing for this action to be available on any land adjoining a water course where cattle may have access, and not just on grassland parcels. </p>  <p>  For rare breeds, and as explained previously in this House, I am making it possible for farmers who acquired Kerry Bog Ponies and Galway Sheep in 2014 and who joined the relevant societies, to enter GLAS now under Tier 1. This particular concession recognises the comparatively greater conservation challenge facing these breeds. The remaining Rare Breeds listed for GLAS continue to provide Tier 1 access under exactly the same terms as before. </p>  <p>  These proposed changes have been notified to the European Commission, as required, and their final response is expected very shortly.</p></reply>

Eligibility requirements under the new ANC scheme have remained largely the same as under the previous schemes, with some minor adjustments. The ANC Scheme has an annual budget of &euro;195 million, and is a central element of the new Rural Development Programme.    The rates of aid payable to farmers whose holding are situated in designated areas are in line with the difficulties that they face in farming in the areas in question. In relation to the changes I have made to the requirements of the Scheme in recent years, my priority has been to ensure that this aid is paid to those who are actively pursuing a farming activity, and who are contributing to the economic life of the rural areas where they farm. </p>  <p>  I also availed of the negotiations of the new Rural Development Programme to introduce a new Island Farming payment as part of the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. This is an important development and is in recognition of the specific challenges that these farmers face on a day by day basis carrying out their normal farming activities. </p>  <p>Payments under the ANC scheme, including the island farmer element, have already commenced.   </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the new Common Agricultural Policy, member states are required to undertake a review of the designation of areas eligible for the ANC scheme by 2018. This new designation will be based on bio-physical criteria such as terrain, and soil conditions. </p>  <p>  Work on the data required to underlie this new designation is currently underway, and the budget allocation for the ANC scheme will also be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

It is also a very important tourist destination in addition to being a major venue for leisure activities with a wide range of recreational users of the harbour. There is also significant number of businesses, particularly restaurants, operating in the Harbour. With that in mind the Department engages with stakeholders to increase the profile of the Harbour for the betterment of the wider community. </p>  <p>To this end, the Harbour regularly approves applications for events, yacht races, local celebrations and various functions etc within the harbour precincts. In addition, the Department approved locating the Howth Tourism Information Office within the confines of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre. This facility opened in July 2014.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, I am happy to be able to advise the Deputy that in excess of &euro;4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2014. </p>  <p>For 2015, I approved funding of &euro;1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre. Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works.    </p>  <p>There are a total of 70 properties in the Howth Fishery Harbour Centre property portfolio encompassing a range of economic activity. Properties are made available by means of competitive public tender, the most recent competition being held on the 15th   June this year. The majority of Fishery Harbour Centre properties are leased by my Department to a variety of public and private sector tenants which support this range of activities. </p>  <p>Employment statistics relating to the private and state organisations operating out of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre are not available, however I am satisfied that the investments made by my Department in the infrastructure of the Harbour are facilitating the maintenance and development of commercial, industrial, leisure and tourist related activity at the harbour and in the wider Howth area.</p></reply>

I have always attached major importance to the live cattle export trade, and my Department, along with Bord Bia, has been extremely proactive during my time as Minister in both encouraging and facilitating shipments abroad and the cross border live trade to Northern Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has in place a good system of transport links to facilitate live exports with the highest standards of animal welfare being at the forefront of procedures for approving transportation options. My Department has approved extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock transport in the year to date. There are currently three dedicated vessels, the MV Express 1, the MV Atlantic M and the MV Holstein Express approved for the carriage of livestock by sea from Irish ports. Two roll-on roll-off vessels are approved for transport to the UK, and one to the France. Three other vessels are currently at various stages of the necessary processes for approval for carriage of livestock abroad. The Department always co-operates with live exporters to the fullest extent possible in order to facilitate live exports while ensuring that all vessels meet our high standards required.   </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to have a strong live export trade to Europe and beyond with over 236,000 head of live cattle worth over &euro;172million being exported last year. So far in 2015, Ireland has exported live cattle to seventeen different countries and the total figure for live cattle exports stands at just under 150,000 head. Our most important markets this year have been the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Spain, Italy, Britain and France. The Dutch calf market in particular has seen sharp growth, with almost 44,000 calves sent there so far in just nine months of 2015 as opposed to 39,000 head in the whole of last year. IBR restrictions and geopolitical instability have impeded previously large-scale exports to Belgium and North Africa respectively. </p>  <p>Trade to Northern Ireland   has improved sharply, up almost 6,000 head or 17% compared to this time last year , with cattle of beef and dairy dams making up 59 % and 41 % of the total, respectively. The total figure for   the year stands at 40,000 head. It should be noted that the weaker euro has been creating more favourable conditions for live exporters.   Currency fluctuations are one of the major factors in determining the relative economic attractiveness of Irish exports to the United Kingdom. </p>  <p>Improved domestic demand and tightening supply have led to a situation where beef producers are receiving a better price than previously at marts. This internal demand explains the overall drop in live exports compared to last year, which have reduced by 25% as of late September. The average price for this year so far is &euro;4.05c/kg for an R3 grade steer excluding VAT. This is over 10% higher than the 2014 average, and is indicative of the generally positive trends that have been present in the beef sector this year.   </p>  <p>Staff from my Department and Bord Bia will continue to work tirelessly to find new market outlets for live exports both within Europe and beyond. Ireland has a strong track record in this regard and events outside our control notwithstanding, we can expect to see continuing strong figures in the live trade in future.</p></reply>

The reductions and penalties apply in instances such as the following situations:    - Where the applicant over-declares the eligible area of his or her land parcels.</p>  <p>- Where the applicant declares land that is also claimed by another farmer (dual claims) and it is established that he or she has no right to declare it for payment.   </p>  <p>- Where the applicant claims land that he or she is no longer farming, which is effectively abandoned land.   </p>  <p>- Where application forms are submitted after the deadline for the submission of applications.   </p>  <p>  The most effective method of reducing the level of penalties that apply to payments under the Basic Payment Scheme is to encourage farmers to ensure that they do not include such ineligible areas in the applications. In that regard, my Department issues maps of all the lands parcels declared for payment on an annual basis to all of the farmers submitting applications under the Direct Payment Schemes. In a covering letter accompanying the maps, farmers are strongly urged to carefully scrutinise the maps and ensure that they exclude all ineligible areas and features from the lands that they declare for payment in that year. </p>  <p>  Many farmers have made arrangements with registered agricultural consultants/advisors to act as their agents for the submission of Direct Payment application forms. The majority of such applications are submitted on-line. Where a farmer has any doubts relating to land eligibility he/she should double check this matter when confirming their application form details with their agent prior to submitting the Direct Payments application form. The vast majority of farmers heed this advice, consulting their agents as necessary and have excluded these ineligible areas from their applications. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to take other action to bring this message to farmers and their agents. For example, my Department issued a comprehensive booklet on land eligibility in May of this year to all applicants. In addition, the opportunity is taken at scheme information meetings throughout the country to make a presentation to farmers on what lands should be excluded from their claims for payment. </p>  <p>Those farmers, who have over-claims detected during the completion of the administrative checks or following ground or remote sensing land eligibility inspections have the right to seek a review of the decision and if they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal the decision to the Agricultural Appeals Office.</p></reply>

These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.  Whilst welcoming the steps previously taken by the Commission, including extensions to the dates for Aids to Private Storage and Intervention, I noted that having regard to the acute downturn in global milk prices over the past several months, and the severe impact this is having on farm incomes, that a number of further steps were urgently required including:   </p>  <p>i.  Utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to temporarily   increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder. </p>  <p>ii.  Restoring the scheme providing Aids to Private Storage for cheese which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately. </p>  <p>iii.  Increasing the EU budget for market supports in light of the fact that the assigned revenues deriving from super levies will be some &euro;400 million higher than originally foreseen in the draft budget for 2016. </p>  <p>iv.  Using exceptional promotion measures to promote the consumption of dairy products on EU, but especially on 3rd   country markets. </p>  <p>v.  Increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties.   </p>  <p>vi.  I also called for the reopening of the scheme on Private Storage for Pigmeat which was closed in May of this year.   </p>  <p>  In the longer term, I also made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues in the future such as more price transparency through the EU&rsquo;s Milk Market Observatory, further consideration of the role that might be played by futures markets, and the use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% increase in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP, took account of Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan.. Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers or the Commission. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion, and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn. </p>  <p>Provision of targeted aid is also a significant initiative. In order to address the existing market disturbance efficiently and effectively and to prevent the situation resulting from that disturbance, or its effect on the market, from continuing or deteriorating further, the Commission deemed it appropriate to provide grant aid to Member States in the form of a one-time financial grant. The aim of this is to support farmers in the relevant sectors who are experiencing the most acute price fall and consequences of the prolongation of the Russian import ban. </p>  <p>  Taking these factors into account, Ireland has been granted an allocation of &euro;13.7 million from an overall fund of &euro;420M. I am consulting with stakeholders at present and will make a decision on the use of this aid in the very near future.</p></reply>

Commonages, which primarily consist of upland grazing, represent a mosaic of extremely important habitats, many of which are designated Natura areas. They are also, however, extremely important areas for agriculture and indeed their environmental value today and the richness of the biodiversity they present is to no small extent a result of hundreds, and indeed, thousands of years of agricultural use. Many of these commonages are now seriously under-grazed, which has had a detrimental effect on both land eligibility and biodiversity. </p>  <p>Under GLAS, one of our main objectives is to restore these uplands to agricultural and environmental health. To do that, we have created a specific measure within the new scheme that encourages shareholders on commonages to come together and draw up a new Commonage Management Plan with the help of a trained GLAS commonage advisor. The main component of this plan is the introduction of a new grazing regime on every commonage, which is tailored to the needs of that commonage, and to which each shareholder in GLAS must now commit and contribute.   </p>  <p>  The new GLAS Commonage Management Plans are required to review the entire area of the commonage, as all this area is potentially accessible to anybody grazing the hill. The Plan, when submitted, will provide a full assessment of the land cover that exists on the ground at present. This is one of its key values: these Plans are based on a new assessment of the condition of the commonage, drawn from site-visits and discussion with the participating shareholders. Amongst other things, the Plan needs to identify the actual grazable area on the commonage and then prepare a series of actions designed to at least maintain that area in good condition, while also addressing the conservation of other important habitats elsewhere. For this reason, under GLAS, my Department will pay on the entire area, not just the area directly available for agriculture. </p>  <p>  The assessment undertaken must address any areas that are possibly ineligible under the current eligibility rules. If a consequence of this is that the Maximum Eligible Area (MEA) needs to be reduced, my Department will need to consider whether the BPS claim on the parcel in question also needs to be reduced in order to ensure that penalties do not occur. However, it should be noted that the MEA approach is considerably more flexible than previous ones, allowing areas of scrub for example to be accommodated within an overall calculation of what is eligible for payment. I believe that the combination of this approach, with a renewed and balanced grazing effort initiated through GLAS, will in fact safeguard the eligibility of these lands into the future.</p></reply>

However, in the context of drawing up the Commonage Management Plans required under GLAS, it is accepted that the GLAS advisor acting for the shareholders concerned may form a different impression of what the commonage can or should carry, in the best interests of its environmental health. In such cases, I have specifically provided that the Advisor may recommend a different stocking level to the one which has been published, to ensure the commonage is adequately grazed and that habitats are protected. If the basis for doing so is sound, that new stocking-level will be accepted and can be used for drawing up the required Commonage Management Plan.    For commonages in excess of 10 hectares, the stocking figures adopted for the Commonage Management Plan are based on what is required to maintain the commonage and requires the active participation of all GLAS farmers who have signed up to the Plan. However, where there are also farmers grazing the commonage under AEOS contracts, the GLAS Advisor drawing up the new Commonage Management Plan may include the grazing effort of these AEOS farmers in his calculations. This has been fully explained to advisors. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for further flexibility in situations where a very small number of shareholders sign up to a Commonage Management Plan and the scale of the grazing requirement is clearly unattainable by that group. These cases will be reviewed by the Commonage Implementation Committee who may recommend that a lower total minimum grazing requirement apply. </p>  <p>  Finally, where some shareholders signing up to the Commonage Management Plan are already grazing in excess of their individual maximum stocking level, I have also provided that this can be accommodated within the Plan if the other shareholders agree. In such cases, the other shareholders can reduce their own grazing effort by up to 50% to rebalance the Plan overall.</p></reply>

As part of the initial ground work to Food Wise 2025, a public consultation took place which involved 15 background papers and a questionnaire. These included a particular focus on climate change and sustainability.</p>  <p>  Sustainability was the brief for one of the five core subgroups of the Food Wise 2025 committee.

As part of the implementation phase of Food Wise, a Sustainability working group will be established. My Department will work closely with relevant actors to ensure appropriate monitoring across all sectors of the agrifood industry on the environmental impacts of the strategy including possible impacts at regional level. This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that environmental considerations were at the heart of Food Wise 2025 an Environmental Analysis (which represented both a Strategic Environmental Assessment and an Appropriate Assessment) was conducted in tandem with the development of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. This analysis was carried out by an independent team of consultants and involved stakeholder and public consultation throughout the process.  My Department chairs a Steering Group with representatives from Teagasc, the EPA and Bord Bia to oversee this process.</p>  <p>  The submissions received in response to the eight week public consultation following publication of Food Wise 2025 and the draft Environmental Analysis report are currently being considered.

The findings, therefore, can only be applied to the situation in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland badger populations are not controlled, even in areas where the historical risk of TB is high.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department implements an official badger population control in areas where badgers are implicated in TB breakdowns and, in this respect, the situation here differs from that in Northern Ireland. As I have stated, the study referred to relates to the possibility that TB may be spread by illegal interference with a sett, not by the removal of badgers in a controlled manner as implemented under my Department&rsquo;s programme. Accordingly, it has no implications for the implementation of this programme. In addition, in Ireland we have no evidence that interference with badger setts may be contributing to maintaining bovine TB. It is the experience of staff in my Department that they very rarely find any evidence of badger sett interference, such as discussed in the research paper to which the Deputy refers. I should also stress that interference with badger setts is illegal and where such instances are found by staff of my Department the details are passed on to officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who follow up such reports.</p>  <p>There is very considerable scientific evidence of a link between badgers and cattle in the context of the spread of bovine TB. Research conducted over the years by my Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed. It is therefore necessary to eradicate TB in both species. In view of this, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal and population control policy since 2004.   </p>  <p>  While the current approach to badger control is cost effective and has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years, the ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme. However, this strategy can only be deployed when data are available to ensure that this can be done in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. In view of this, various projects, involving vaccine development and oral-delivery techniques are under way (including a collaboration with the United Kingdom), with a view to developing a viable badger TB vaccine and vaccination strategy.</p></reply>

It also provides that when necessary, the reference thresholds shall be updated in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure in the light of developments in production and markets. The Commission have been reluctant to engage in such a review, preferring to utilise enhanced supports in other areas. Furthermore, they have made it clear that the legislative procedure under which this would be undertaken would entail an 18 month lead in time. In such circumstances, my preferred approach was to examine the possibility of utilising provisions under &ldquo;Exceptional Measures&rdquo;, to introduce flexible instruments, such as a modified or temporary intervention scheme, more quickly, by delegated act.   </p>  <p>In early September I presented a paper offering possible solutions to both the EU Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues. These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and as a response to the market issues that had developed and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.   </p>  <p>  I welcomed steps previously taken by the Commission but noted that having regard to the acute downturn in global milk prices over the past several months, and the severe impact this is having on farm incomes, that a number of further steps were urgently required. These certainly included utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to temporarily increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder. As outlined earlier to the house I made calls for numerous other measures in the areas of Aids to Private Storage for cheese, which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately. </p>  <p>Another key request was increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme and from 16th   October 2015 to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties. In addition to these more immediate concerns I made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give longer term consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues. </p>  <p>I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council took significant account of Ireland&rsquo;s requests. Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn.   </p>  <p>In respect of the direct aid element within the suite of measures mentioned above, I am engaging with stakeholders and will make a decision on the use of this   aid in the very near future.</p></reply>

Commonages, which primarily consist of upland grazing, represent a mosaic of extremely important habitats, many of which are designated Natura areas. They are also, however, extremely important areas for agriculture and many of these commonages are now seriously under-grazed, which has had a detrimental effect on both land eligibility and biodiversity.  Under GLAS, one of our main objectives is to restore these uplands to agricultural and environmental health. To do that, we have created a specific measure within the new scheme that encourages shareholders on commonages to come together and draw up a new Commonage Management Plan with the help of a trained GLAS advisor. The main component of this plan is the introduction of a new grazing regime on each commonage, which is tailored to the needs of that commonage, and to which each shareholder in GLAS must now commit and contribute.   </p>  <p>  The new GLAS Commonage Management Plans are required to review the entire area of the commonage, as all this area is potentially accessible to anybody grazing the hill. The Plan, when submitted, will provide a full assessment of the land cover that exists on the ground at present. This is one of its key values: these Plans are based on a new assessment of the condition of the commonage, drawn from site-visits and discussion with the participating shareholders. Amongst other things, the Plan needs to identify the actual grazable area on the commonage and then prepare a series of actions designed to at least maintain that area in good condition, while also addressing the conservation of other important habitats elsewhere. For this reason, under GLAS, my Department will pay on the entire area, not just the area directly available for agriculture. </p>  <p>  The assessment undertaken must address any areas that are possibly ineligible under the current eligibility rules. If a consequence of this is that the Maximum Eligible Area (MEA) needs to be reduced, my Department will need to consider whether the BPS claim on the parcel in question also needs to be reduced in order to ensure that penalties do not occur. However, it should be noted that the MEA approach is considerably more flexible than previous ones, allowing areas of scrub for example to be accommodated within an overall calculation of what is eligible for payment. </p>  <p>In some circumstances my Department may deem it necessary to conduct a ground check on certain commonages where the planner has indicated that there is a change in the reference area/MEA of a commonage.     I believe that the combination of this approach, with a renewed and balanced grazing effort initiated through GLAS, will in fact safeguard the eligibility of these lands into the future.</p></reply>

Nitrogen, in the form of Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), Phosphorous and Potash constitute the vast majority of fertiliser nutrients used in Ireland and since all fertiliser used in Ireland is imported, Irish fertiliser companies have little control over the price at which they buy their products on the global market. </p>  <p>On-farm prices range from &euro;330 to &euro;450 /tonne depending on type and nutrient content. Fertiliser costs are among the highest input costs in Irish agriculture at 20% on average and can amount to double this for certain tillage crops.   </p>  <p>Currently, Europe is only 80% self-sufficient in fertiliser production and must import 20% of its requirements. As such, European and Irish fertiliser prices are strongly linked to global prices and heavily influenced by supply and demand. With global demand outstripping supply, Irish fertiliser prices have increased by 6-8% so far in 2015. It is anticipated that world demand will continue to increase into the future maintaining upward pressure on prices to the final consumer in Ireland.   </p>  <p>The advice from Teagasc is for farmers to keep in contact with merchants as prices often spike at periods of high demand when European order books are full. Purchasing fertilisers at off-peak periods will help minimise prices. Teagasc further advises that finding alternative sources of major nutrients will save money and farmers should consider the use of slurry applications to minimise expenditure on chemical fertilisers. In addition, soil testing will prevent unnecessary applications.</p></reply>

I understand that Coillte has stated that the proceeds from the transaction will strengthen the company&rsquo;s balance sheet and support their ongoing investment of &euro;59 million in one of their panel board subsidiaries, SmartPly which is based in Belview Port, outside Waterford city, and further investment in its renewable energy business.  In relation to the actual transaction, Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988. In compliance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, such a significant disposal was a matter for the Board of Coillte while my approval and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal were required, also under the Code of Practice. The business was sold through a competitive bidding process in which the sale of the assets was widely advertised. The sale was handled on Coillte&rsquo;s behalf by Goodbody Corporate Finance and overseen closely by the Board of the company.   </p>  <p>Coillte has stated that, while sites at 298 locations were included in the sale, the total area of land associated with these sites is less than 15 hectares. The company has also given an assurance that access to its forests for recreation use is unaffected by the sale of their telecoms portfolio.   </p>  <p>The decision to dispose of Coillte&rsquo;s telecommunications portfolio was not made by me or the Government. It was a business decision by Coillte to capitalise on the significant value built up in its telecommunications business over the last 30 years at a time when there is considerable interest in acquiring infrastructure assets and to use the proceeds for re-investment in core aspects of its business thus creating new State assets.   </p>  <p>As I have mentioned, under the Code of Practice, significant disposals are a matter for the Board. The company is currently refreshing its corporate strategy which I will be considering in due course.</p></reply>

The protections, such as the muzzling of greyhounds, which were introduced in 1993 have played an important role in safeguarding hares involved in coursing. In addition to supervision by officers from the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service, my Department&rsquo;s veterinary officials attend around 10% of coursing meetings with a view to ensuring optimum welfare standards. These are selected through a combination of random and risk-based decision making.  The Deputy will be aware that the matter was both debated at length and voted upon during the extensive debates that occurred during the passage of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I think that we have struck a reasonable balance in the legislation as between those opposed to hare coursing and those who consider it to be a legitimate sport.   </p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 applies across the board, both to rural and urban areas and to all animals, irrespective of species, whether kept for commercial, domestic, sport, show or for other purposes. Under the Act, the penalties are as high as can be permitted under our legal system such that on summary conviction, a person can be fined up to &euro;5,000 and/ or imprisoned for up to 6 months; on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years may be imposed. There is provision for fixed penalty payments for lesser offences. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.

Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years prior to the abolition of dairy quotas . F actors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers on the supply side. The longer term perspectives remain very positive and Irish dairy farmers are well placed to take full advantage of rising global demand. The ending of EU milk quotas has not witnessed anything that could be described as a spike in production at EU level. Ireland has sought to avail of the opportunity that longer term trends will bring.    I have maintained ongoing contact with the Irish banks and have impressed upon them at every opportunity of the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015 and into 2016. Most recently at the dairy forum, I reiterated these calls to the three main banks in attendance. The Irish dairy sector is cost competitive and Teagasc figures indicate that Irish farmers have relatively low levels of indebtedness compared to counterparts in competition countries. The banks assured me that they will remain vigilant on this issue, particularly if prices continue to deteriorate into spring 2016 therefore and will be facilitative in the measures available and in their dealings with dairy farmers. They stressed the need for early engagement for those who see early signs of such liquidity imbalance. </p>  <p>  The Government has also been proactive of course and chief among the initiatives here are provisions allowing dairy and other farmers to use income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. This also offers respite to the sector from a cash flow perspective. Furthermore, I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan. The recent agreement at the council of Agriculture Ministers to increase the rate of single Farm Payment advance to 70% will also be of assistance from a cash plan perspective. </p>  <p>Finally I decided to make a 3 year interest free instalment arrangement available to all those affected by superlevy this year This option has been availed of by approximately 3,700 producers and will be of assistance to farmers facing cash flow difficulties arising from super levy in the final year of the milk quota regime.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the penalties are as high as can be permitted under our legal system such that on summary conviction, a person can be fined up to &euro;5,000 and/or sentenced to up to 6 months imprisonment; on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years may be imposed. There is provision for fixed penalty payments for lesser offences.  The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides a robust vehicle to enable the respective authorities to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute any breaches of the welfare provisions of the Act by dog shelters, boarding kennels, dog breeders and behaviourists or trainers. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation.  My Department operates an Animal Welfare Hotline on which members of the public can report suspected incidents of animal neglect.  All such reports are followed up by officers of my Department.  If there are any specific allegations about individuals or organisations they can be notified to the Animal Welfare Hotline.</p></reply>

The BDGP is an essential component in reversing the widely acknowledged decline in the maternal index of the Irish suckler herd.  The BDGP will also improve the quality of the national suckler herd and deliver an accelerated improvement in the environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for each of the first eligible 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each of the remaining hectares up to the maximum payable area.  The maximum payable area is based on the number of calved suckler cows in each herd in 2014.  The payment rates provide for a higher payment linked to the first 10 animals on each herd as I felt it was important to favour smaller herds through this programme.  The payment rate of &euro;142.50 is the maximum amount which could be provided based on the cost incurred and income foregone associated with the actions under the BDGP, as negotiated with the European Commission. </p><p>The focus has now turned to implementation of the scheme which is now well underway and my Department and the ICBF are working closely with scheme participants on the various requirements. This is progressing well with over 255,000 tissue tags sent to scheme applicants to date. This leaves only 70,000 more to be sent out and the ICBF expect that these will be in the post within the next two weeks.  Over 70,000 samples have been sent back for genomic testing, which covers over 7,000 herds.  This is a very positive start to the BDGP as it means that already 25% of participants have completed their genotyping requirement in the BDGP.  A reminder letter will issue to farmers who have not yet sent back their samples by the end of next week.  The online facility for recording animal survey data is now open and around 5,500 farmers have used this method to complete their surveys with this number expected to rise.</p><p>In addition, my Department in conjunction with the ICBF and Teagasc are holding a series of information meetings nationwide for scheme participants.  These meetings will enable farmers within the scheme to have one to one time with Department , ICBF and Teagasc staff in order to query any aspect of the scheme and look at their own personal circumstances with regards to the requirements they will have to fulfil to ensure full compliance, and therefore full payment, with the scheme. </p><p>The<i></i>BDGP is a new and innovative programme.  It&rsquo;s a world first in terms of bringing genomic technology to beef farming and can revolutionise beef breeding in this country and help to drive on-farm profitability, while improving the environmental sustainability of the beef.</p></reply>

The main compensation scheme for these farmers is the On-Farm Market Valuation Scheme, which provides for full compensation, based on current &ldquo;Market Value&rdquo;, for the direct losses incurred by farmers arising from the removal of cattle as reactors.  In addition to these valuation payments, herdowners who experience a disease breakdown may also qualify for compensation, for consequential losses, under the Income Supplement, Depopulation or Hardship Grant Schemes, subject to the terms and conditions applying in each case.  Payments under these schemes are designed to compensate herdowners for income losses or additional costs incurred by farmers who have animals removed as reactors and whose herds are restricted.  In relation specifically to the Income Supplement Scheme, a farmer must lose in excess of 10% of his animals to TB before payment can be considered. </p>  <p>  Total expenditure on compensation paid to farmers in 2014 under the TB eradication scheme amounted to &euro;15.2m.  My officials are currently engaged in a review of these schemes and I will be making an announcement shortly in relation to this matter. </p>  <p>  With regard to the restrictions on buying further animals into a TB restricted herd, the position is that these restrictions derive from EU legislation governing bovine TB eradication programmes.  Article 17 of Council Directive 78/52 EEC provides that a herd in which bovine TB is confirmed may not be restocked until after the cattle identified as reactors are slaughtered and all cattle, over six weeks old, remaining in the herd have passed one official tuberculosis test.  Once a herd passes such a test, it may be restocked under permit from the Regional Veterinary Office.  Given that this requirement derives from binding EU legislation, it is not open to my Department to depart from it.</p></reply>

In particular, almost all finfish licences awaiting decision are renewal applications.</p><p>* Does not include applications withdrawn by applicant/closed by Department.</p><p>Since taking office I have made 302 determinations in respect of shellfish aquaculture licence applications and 5 in respect of finfish aquaculture, of which 4 are for land based sites.  The difference in numbers between shellfish and finfish reflects the greater number of operators conducting shellfish aquaculture and also, crucially, the hugely complex nature of the assessment process involved in respect of finfish.  This is not to suggest that the assessment process is simple in the case of shellfish.  However the requirement for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement in the case of finfish cultivation in the marine environment adds a significant regulatory requirement on operators and on my Department when conducting assessments. </p><p>In addition, my Department in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is conducting an &quot;Appropriate Assessment&quot; process in respect of designated NATURA bays.  This process was agreed with the European Commission and is designed to ensure that Ireland is in full compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. </p><p>This process includes the following steps:</p><p>- a detailed data collection in 91 Bays / Estuaries</p><p>- detailed analysis of raw data collected</p><p>- setting of Conservation Objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in respect of each site</p><p>- carrying out Appropriate Assessments of each licence application / fishery plan against the detailed Conservation Objectives set, and </p><p>- determination of Licences on the basis of the Appropriate Assessment and other relevant factors </p><p>The Appropriate Assessment process has now been completed in respect of twelve bays &ndash; Castlemaine Harbour, Roaringwater Bay, Dundalk Bay, Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay, Dungarvan Harbour, Ballycotton Bay, Kenmare Bay, Valentia Harbour/Portmagee Channel, Galway Bay, Clew Bay and Drumcliff Bay/Cummeen Harbour.</p><p>The completion of the process on a bay by bay basis enables my Department to assess applications for new licences or the renewal of licences. Pending a decision on the renewal of licences, operators may lawfully continue their aquaculture activity under the provisions of Section 19A (4) of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.</p><p>The regulatory procedures in respect of all aquaculture activities have never been stronger and represent a good balance between the need to develop the Industry and provide the highest level of protection for our marine and coastal environment.  They are however highly complex in nature and resource intensive.  The Deputy will be aware that in Food Wise 2025 I have undertaken to commission a review of the existing aquaculture licensing system involving all key stakeholders, to identify the current shortcomings and bottlenecks (legislative, resource and logistical), and implement necessary changes to the aquaculture licensing system as a matter of priority. This measure is a further indication of the importance I attach to getting our licensing system fit for purpose in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the industry in the medium to long term.</p></reply>

Applications were received from every single county and virtually every action was selected at some stage.  On the basis of the plans submitted for the 27,000 applications received to date, we have already met or exceeded RDP targets for a number of different actions, including Low Input Permanent Pasture.  For the second tranche of GLAS, therefore, I am revisiting the various actions that will be available to farmers in the light of the substantial progress made to date. </p>  <p>  GLAS differs from previous schemes in that it adopts a very targeted approach to meeting its environmental objectives and the RDP includes a provision for review and reassessment after the first tranche. Given the very high uptake of Low Input Permanent Pasture (LIPP), and the fact that it has substantially exceeded its targets, it is proposed to adjust the provision of this action under the next tranche.  As things stand, over 20% of the entire budget for GLAS is set to be paid on Low Input Permanent Pasture, and we clearly cannot continue to accept additional hectarage at the same rate indefinitely.  However, it is important to note that it will still be possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component will be limited to 5 hectares.  While this means that we will still see permanent pasture coming into GLAS, I hope it will persuade more farmers to take the hay meadow option, which is well behind target, and which delivers the same payment per hectare. </p>  <p>  These proposed changes for Tranche 2, including the rebalancing of LIPP, have been notified to the European Commission and their final response is expected very shortly.</p></reply>

The fourth annual report <i>&quot;Milestones for Success 2014&quot; </i>published September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained.</p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July this year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020.  It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 380 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations.</p><p>If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise strategy believes that the following growth projections are achievable by 2025:</p><p>- Increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion;</p><p>- Increasing the value added in the agri-food, fisheries and wood products sector by 70% to in excess of &euro;13 billion;</p><p>- Increasing the value of primary production by 65% to almost &euro;10 billion;</p><p>- The creation of an additional 23,000 direct jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p><p>Realising these growth projections will be challenging, but I am confident that they can be achieved.  Last week I chaired the first meeting of the High Level Implementation Committee for Food Wise 2025, including senior executives from relevant state agencies and Government Departments.  I am committed to putting in place a robust implementation process, which will be influenced by the final Environmental Report on the strategy. As the Food Wise report states, &quot;<i>environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one cannot be achieved at the expense of the other&quot;. </i>Therefore sustainability will be at the core of the strategy&rsquo;s implementation.</p></reply>

The Chinese authorities decided in February 2015 to lift the BSE ban on boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age from Ireland making us the first EU MS to achieve this goal.  This move, while very significant, does not permit trade to commence and my Department is working closely with its counterparts in China to conclude the necessary technical steps, which need to be completed before trade commences.  The US market was opened to Irish beef exports in January 2015.  Feedback from exporters eligible to export beef to the US indicates that exports to date had reached approximately 330 tonnes by early September.  This would have an approximate value of &euro;2.1m.  This is a very encouraging start, particularly given that the trade to date is confined to the market for intact cuts as we currently await approval to export beef intended for grinding.  It must be remembered that only two plants were eligible to export up to mid-May and June respectively.  There are now six plants approved to export and my understanding is that this momentum in exports will continue and grow right through to the end of 2015.  As with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.   </p>  <p>  More importantly the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe this year means that US buyers can be priced out of the market and Irish exporters are choosing to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent.  Exports to the UK are up 4,000t compared with the same period in 2014 and this coincides with a reduced kill overall (back about 6% year on year) highlighting further the strength of Irish beef exports in the UK.  This of course is helped by a strong sterling and weak euro. </p>  <p>  Overall, 2015 has been a very positive year for beef prices in Ireland with the yearly average to date almost 10% up on last year; &euro;4.04 for an R3 steer excluding vat, compared to &euro;3.70 in 2014, a 10% increase.  Prices last week are 10% up on the same week last year notwithstanding recent price decreases.  Ireland is currently at 104% of the EU 15 price and 107% of the EU 28 price. </p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international   markets for Irish beef.  For example I recently concluded an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where already this year there has been almost &euro;10 m of beef exports from Ireland , making us the second largest exporter of beef into the Philippines.  Furthermore we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including Korea, Vietnam and Mexico.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace.</p></reply>

The Short Term Enterprise Allowance provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s&rsquo; Benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit.  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years; 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  </p>  <p>  Under both schemes, those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved as viable and sustainable.  In partnership areas this will be done by the partnership company Integrated Development Company (IDC).  A qualifying business must be approved in advance by (IDC) or a Case Officer of the Department.  It must be deemed genuine and viable, and not displace an existing business.  In assessing viability, cognisance is taken of the demand for, and supply of, the particular product or service at local level.</p>  <p>  At the end of September 2015 there were 469 people availing of the Short Term Enterprise Allowance, 21 of whom are living in Co. Kerry and there were 11,825 people availing of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance, 387 of whom are living in Co. Kerry.  The Department does not collect information on the number of applications received or rejected.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must:</p>  <p>- have at least 520 paid contributions, and</p>  <p>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>  <p>  However the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  Where someone over 66 does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may apply for a non-contributory pension, which is based on need and is means tested.  The maximum rate of this pension is &euro;219 weekly, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension.</p>  <p>  Where it is more beneficial for the claimant, they may instead seek an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, on their spouse&rsquo;s State pension contributory, the maximum rate of which is &euro;206.30.  This increase is, by default, paid directly to the Qualified Adult.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.</p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014 (a similar number are expected to be provided in 2015).  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.

It is anticipated that the YEI funding will be matched by a similar amount of ESF funding, with the balance coming from matching domestic expenditure. In the normal course of events, this amount of YEI funding will be drawn down as final claims are made in respect of these years. However, I understand that an advance payment of &euro;21,465,806.99 was made to Ireland under the YEI earlier this year.</p>  <p>  YEI funding has been applied for in relation to only some of the programmes that go to make up Ireland&rsquo;s response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee. The overall range of such programmes is set out in the government&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, which estimated annual expenditure on the core programmes involved of approximately &euro;336 million, with a further expenditure on other relevant programmes (Apprenticeship and PLC courses) of &euro;192 million. Actual expenditure on participation by young people  on this range of programmes in 2015 will depend on the take-up of places, and can be estimated only after the end of the financial year.</p></reply>

The reduced rates have been extended over the intervening years and now apply to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients under 26 years of age.</p>  <p>  The reduced rates do not apply to certain categories of jobseeker, for example those with a qualified child or those whose claim is linked to a previous claim at the higher rate made within the previous 12 months.</p>  <p>  The reduced rates for young jobseekers are a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  The measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment.</p>  <p>  There are a wide range of education and training opportunities available through the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. These opportunities for jobseekers support them in strengthening their qualifications and skills base thereby maximising their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment. These opportunities include the back to education allowance scheme, Education and Training Board (ETB) training courses, VEC education courses, T&uacute;s and JobBridge - the national internship scheme.</p>  <p>  There is a network of case officers at a local level who work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes for them.  Young jobseekers who participate on an education or training programme will receive a higher weekly payment. For example, young jobseekers who participate in the t&uacute;s programme will have their payment increased to &euro;208 per week and jobseekers who attend ETB training courses will have their payment increased to &euro;160 per week.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection administers the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) which is an educational opportunities scheme for persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  The objective of the scheme is to raise educational and skills levels to enable them to better access to emerging labour market needs in line with the Government&rsquo;s activation strategy set out in Pathways to Work.  For persons under the age of 26 who are in receipt of an age related jobseekers payment, a personal maximum rate of &euro;160 applies.  The full year cost of increasing the back to education allowance rate to &euro;188 per week for recipients aged under 26 years is estimated at a maximum of &euro;6.6 million.  These costs are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2016.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted this cost only refers to the back to education allowance.  If young jobseekers attending ETB training courses were to receive an increased payment of &euro;188 this would have cost implications for the Department of Education and Skills.  Any change to provision in this area would be a matter for Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Funds established under section 44 do not require approval of the Central Bank. The Central Bank informs me that it is supportive of such initiatives by credit unions provided they fall within the provisions of section 44. These provisions include a requirement that funds paid into such a special fund can only be paid out of the annual operating surplus of a credit union and that no funds may be paid into such a special fund unless adequate provision has been made out of the annual surplus to cover all current and contingent liabilities and to maintain proper reserves. There is also a requirement that the payment of the funds into the special fund will not affect the financial stability of the credit union. In addition section 44(3) specifies that the amount of funds which may be paid out of the annual operating surplus into such special fund shall not exceed 0.5% of the value of the credit unions' assets.</p></reply>

Credit unions are currently not subject to the dormant accounts legislation. Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended) does not make reference to Dormant Accounts. Dormant accounts in credit unions, and the practices surrounding them, are governed by Rule 22 of the Standard Rules for Credit Unions published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by DECLG that an analysis of the benefit of adding dormant credit union accounts to the Dormant Accounts Fund has not been carried out. In practical terms, increasing the amount available in the Fund does not necessarily allow for the introduction of new dormant accounts measures or programmes, which is the focus of DECLG in respect of the Fund. While applying the provisions of the dormant accounts legislation to credit union accounts could increase the size of the Fund, Government Departments must source monies for dormant accounts programmes and measures from their Exchequer allocation in the same way as with any other funding programme. When the monies expended on dormant accounts measures and programmes are reimbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund, the refund is to the Exchequer rather than to the spending Department. For this reason, dormant accounts expenditure is subject to the same constraints within Departments as any other spending programme.  </p>  <p>  In addition, expenditure on new dormant accounts measures or programmes would serve to increase Government debt levels, as moneys disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund belong to the account holder, who can reclaim it at any time, and not to the State.  Consequently, every euro spent from the Fund is regarded in accounting terms as a potential Government liability.  </p>  <p>  It would be a matter for Government on the advice of the Department of Finance or DCELG to decide on any extension to the Dormant Account legislation to include credit unions. However, there are no plans at present to introduce such a change.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-07a.183.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100700074#WRG00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, together.  </p>  <p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  </p>  <p>  Where breaches of any regulatory requirements occur, firms and/or individuals can expect vigorous investigation and follow through by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conduct, including the CCMA.  Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate.   </p>  <p>  There is no legal issue, therefore, over whether or not regulated entities are to comply with this statutory code.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  The precise issue that arose before the Courts was the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.  In that regard, the Supreme Court found that where a breach of the CCMA involves a failure of the lender to abide with the moratorium referred in the CCMA, but in no other circumstances, non-compliance with the CCMA affects a relevant lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession.  Following on from this, a breach of any other aspect of the CCMA does not in itself adversely affect a lender's contractual right to possession in the circumstances of mortgage default.     </p>  <p>  The Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances.  The Supreme Court has therefore ruled that where the Code of Conduct prohibits the seeking of an order for possession the Courts will enforce that prohibition.  To quote from the judgement of the Supreme Court:</p>  <p>  "A financial institution which, entirely ignoring the provisions of the Code in that regard, simply went ahead and sought possession as soon as it was legally entitled so to do would be doing the very thing which the Code is designed to prevent.  For a court to entertain an application for possession which was brought in circumstances of clear breach of the moratorium would be for a court to act in aid of the actions of a financial institution which were clearly unlawful (by being in breach of the Code) and in circumstances where the very act of the financial institution concerned in seeking possession was contrary to the intention or purpose behind the Code itself."  </p>  <p>  Where the code does not so prohibit and where it is not illegal for an order of possession to be sought then it is not a matter in which the Courts will intervene.  I am pleased to note that the Supreme Court decision has in fact recognised that the CCMA forms part of the law and that a regulated financial institution is obliged, as a matter of law, to obey it.  However, it should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.     </p>  <p>  The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.  If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.  Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to, insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.  Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate the genuine concerns Deputies may have regarding the implications of the particular decision for borrowers in genuine difficulty with a mortgage on their own home.  While the full implications of the decision can be considered further by my own officials and the Central Bank, as I have already noted, the Central Bank has powers to both supervise and enforce that Code.  In any event the recent changes to the Land and Conveyancing Act and the Personal Insolvency Act has given a statutory right to a borrower to propose a sustainable solution to creditors, or failing that a court, as an alternative to repossession.</p></reply>

The review assessed the legal, regulatory and prudential supervisory framework in place to fulfil  the Central Bank's mandate under section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and accordingly focused on the legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of credit unions in effect at the time of the review.  Overall the review found that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The review included a number of recommendations for refinements under the 3 broad areas: Supervisory Approach; Communications and Guidance; and Resources. ICURN made a number of recommendations in relation to each area.  Under the heading Communications and Guidance, ICURN also suggested that consideration be given by the relevant authority to directing a review to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  ICURN further stated that this is not a matter for the Central Bank. As Minister for Finance I have no plans at this time to carry out such a review.  </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.    </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.  When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions.  It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations.   </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.   </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed.  It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.  The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.    </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework.  As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

The number of site visits by potential multi-national investors to Co. Galway to the middle of 2015 is 16.At present, there are 63 IDA supported companies in Galway City and County, employing 13,862 in total. IDA Ireland actively markets Galway as part of its West region, which comprises counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. The agency has developed property solutions in Galway, which are promoted across its global offices. In particular, there are two sites in Tuam that IDA Ireland markets. The first is the Tuam Business Park, which is a 13.48ha site. The second is the 10.73ha Tuam Business &amp;amp; Technology Park. Tenants include companies such as Valeo Vision Systems, Transitions Optical, Logstrup and SSL Logistics.</p><p>The availability of an adequate supply of marketable, serviced land and office and industrial/technology buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s ability to compete for mobile FDI. </p><p>The availability of property solutions eliminates the lead times normally associated with acquiring property, enables clients to plan their property needs with a greater degree of certainty and allows for the commencement of projects at an earlier date by eliminating much of the difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction.</p><p>IDA Ireland launched its new Strategy for the next five years earlier this year. Entitled &lsquo;Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rsquo;, it sets out the IDA Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieve a significant increase in the amount of FDI projects going into regions and outlines the strategic actions aimed at achieving that the organisation's regional goals. One such strategic action is a &euro;150m property investment plan, which will be spread out over five years. The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, as well asinvesting in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and building new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations. </p><p>Competition for FDI is intense and global, with virtually every country in the world actively seeking new FDI investments but IDA Ireland has a long and credible track record of presenting potential investors with the best location options throughout Ireland for each client. The agency actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland, however, the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by its clients and not by IDA Ireland<font color="#5F5F5F">.</font></p></reply>

It identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the agrifood sector and provides an enabling strategy with more than 380 specific recommendations, which will allow the sector to grow and prosper. As a small open economy which exports the vast bulk of its main agricultural commodities, Ireland will always feel the effects of volatility on world markets. However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods:</p>  <p>- Direct payments estimated by Teagasc at an average of over &euro;19,000 per farm in 2014 provide a valuable source of farm income support and act as a hedge against price volatility. </p>  <p>- The measures in the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme will provide vital support through farm investment, agri-environment and knowledge transfer schemes. </p>  <p>- The package introduced by the EU Commission recently to address difficulties in the dairy and pig meat sectors reflects the majority of the demands I presented to them, particularly</p>  <p>- The increase of more than 100% in the rate of private storage aid for skimmed milk powder.</p>  <p>- The award of almost &euro;14 million in direct aid to Ireland. </p>  <p>- The concession made by the Commission to allow advance payments of 70% under the direct payments scheme and 85% for rural development schemes before completion of controls, which will be of major benefit in easing the cash flow of farmers.</p>  <p>  I believe that an important insulation against volatility is moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced.</p>  <p>  I have regular meetings with the CEOs of the main banks, and I know that they are all aware of the difficulties in dairy prices this year, and are planning accordingly in terms of managing dairy loans.-	Lower costs of production mean lower exposure to price and input volatility. In Ireland our grass based system gives us a natural advantage in this regard, and my Department is doing a lot to improve efficiency on farms, with the assistance of discussions groups and Teagasc advisory, education and research work, and in the processing sector, with initiatives like Origin Green. </p>  <p>  The European Commission decided in June to establish a new High level Forum for a Better Functioning of the Food Chain comprising Member States and representatives of parties in the food supply chain and will assist the Commission with the development of measures contributing to a better functioning food supply chain.</p>  <p>  Also, the 2013 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was a useful and progressive reform making the CAP fit for purpose to 2020. It provided Irish farmers and the agrifood sector with policy certainty for the years to come and with strategic financial support to increase sustainability and enhance competitiveness. I will continue to work with my EU colleagues to ensure that we engage in policies that promote the interests of the EU agricultural sector.</p></reply>

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassy staff, on market access issues. These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to, Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran and the US, to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines the UAE, and Canada and to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia. </p><p>In relation to China, there has been a lifting of the ban on boneless beef from Ireland for animals under 30 months. However, further work is required before trade will commence and my Department is at present engaging with the Chinese authorities on these technical aspects. </p><p>Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the European Union. This broad portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy, which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives in 2015 is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of the Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop and commit to sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities. </p><p>The poultry sector plays an important role within the Irish agricultural economy, accounting for approximately 2% of gross agricultural output and supporting around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas. Export values for poultry meat have increased steadily over the last few years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year, as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products. A high proportion of these exports are destined for the UK market and redirected to international markets through agents for fifth quarter&rsquo; product like chicken feet in particular. Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected. </p><p>The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me, given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. The growth in Irish pigmeat exports to international markets evident over recent years has been negatively impacted by the restrictions of the Russian trade ban, however this has been offset by the opening of alternative spot markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines. These Asian markets will continue to provide valuable opportunities for Irish pork producers into the future. </p><p><b>Milk Markets</b></p><p>The milk quota regime ended on March 31st. The abolition of milk quota presents a massive opportunity for the Irish dairy sector and one which we should look forward to with confidence. Planning for the post quota period has been ongoing amongst all stakeholders for a number of years and I believe we have the right balance of measures in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers can enter the new era with full confidence. </p><p>Irish Dairy produce is exported to approaching 130 countries and in 2014 exports were valued at over &euro;3bn. Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential. The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect. Ireland exported dairy products worth &euro;2.3bn in 2010 and by last year this had risen by over one-third to over &euro;3bn. I remain acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish dairy products. Notwithstanding our successful trade performance, I continue to work with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agrifood sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. </p><p>Since taking office I have led Trade Missions to a variety of destinations in recent years, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish Food and Beverages and dairy promotion has been a significant feature of such missions. I intend to lead missions to China, Vietnam and Africa in the coming months. Most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity. </p><p><b>Seafood</b></p><p>Irish seafood exports recorded an increase of 7.3% in 2014 to reach a value of &euro;533 million. The main EU markets, namely France, Spain, UK, Italy and Germany continue to dominate seafood exports, accounting for in excess of 50% of export values. However, this compares to a 60% share in 2012 and demonstrates the on-going focus of the leading Irish seafood exporters in the development of new business in emerging markets to offset some price resistance in core European markets. </p><p>The seafood sector offers huge potential for expansion. There are a number of significant macro trends which are expected have an impact on the future direction of the Irish seafood sector and which indicate that the prospects for this industry both at a global and European level are very favourable, especially in the medium to long term. Strong global population growth , which is expected to reach 8 billion by 2025 , will result in a huge new market for seafood. Some experts estimate that an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood will be required annually by 2030. Coupled with the forecast global population growth, the rate of income growth in the Asia Pacific region is also anticipated to have far reaching implications for the consumption and trade of seafood. </p><p>Despite the opportunities for Irish seafood in emerging markets, it is important to note that longer term opportunities are not restricted solely to these regions. One of the key achievements of the sector in 2014 was the growth in exports in the core European markets with Ireland maintaining its premium position and growing sales on the back of four years of sluggish growth. In the longer term, supply constraints in these markets as a result of the shift in global supply to the East will present niche opportunities for Irish seafood exporters. It is important therefore that Ireland&rsquo;s strong position and reputation in these markets is maintained and promoted to encourage loyalty and to hold market share. </p><p>Bord Bia recognises the significant growth potential of seafood and is committed to supporting the Irish seafood sector in taking advantage of these opportunities through an expansion of its seafood marketing and promotions programme over the coming years.</p></reply>

However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators (FBOs).  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done through a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators are required to have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that FBOs at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control, must ensure that the requirements of food law are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that FBOs must have systems in place to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food.  They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional traceability requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and its Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is also carried out in each Department-approved plant, which includes checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating both in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by the Department.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  The import controls procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.  Reports of the findings of inspections are published on the FVO&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In order to import fish or fishery products into Ireland from a third country, the person who wishes to import the products is required to register with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).  The SFPA and the Border Inspection Posts operate an agreed sampling plan, which is reviewed annually, to ensure that they meet the EU criteria with respect to potential contaminants, and for the presence of any medical residues or where there is concern that the product may not be fit for human consumption.</p>  <p>  Specific requirements for consumer information for fishery and aquaculture products such as more detailed information on provenance are also set down in EU Regulations under (EU 1379/2013) on the common organisation of markets.  The Regulations on fish labelling are enforced by the SFPA as part of ongoing official controls in food establishments under their supervision.  Comprehensive labelling checks including country of origin are carried out in establishments under SFPA official control as part of routine inspections by authorised officers and at retail level by the Environmental Officers.</p>  <p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products are laid down in EU legislation. For beef, compulsory rules have been in place for many years, and require food business operators to label fresh, frozen or minced beef with specific information to enable the product to be traced back to the animals from which it was derived.  This must include details of the slaughterhouse and de-boning hall in which the animal was processed, and the country in which it was born, reared and slaughtered.  In 2011 the European Union passed the Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169/2011, which is applicable to all foods intended for the final consumer and including foods delivered to mass caterers.  In particular, the FIC Regulation extends mandatory origin labelling to meats other than beef for the first time.  The implementing provision is Commission Regulation No. 1337/2013, which introduced mandatory origin labelling for meat from pigs, poultry, sheep and goats with effect from the 1 April 2015.  Under this regulation, labelling is required to identify the Member State or third country of rearing and the Member State or third country of slaughter for these meats.  The term &lsquo;Origin&rsquo; can also be used where the country/member state of birth is the same as the country of rearing and slaughter.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong proponent of such rules and I have signed into law a new Statutory Instrument to ensure that the necessary provisions are in place to implement this mandatory labelling requirement.  In addition, my Department is working closely with the Department of Health with a view to extending the legislation to include &lsquo;loose meats&rsquo; e.g. meat cuts sold through butcher counters.  I expect rules to cover loose meats to be introduced before the end of the year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-10-07a.251.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015100700077#WRK00700"><p>The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services.  In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets.  Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years.  Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery.  My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain broadly in line with the EU average at present.  However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices.  This is a function of the market.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market.  My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia.  However the restrictions on other products under the EU-wide ban is not something which Ireland alone will resolve and will only be progressed through a common EU approach.  The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution.</p>  <p>  At last month&rsquo;s Special Meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I joined with other like-minded Ministers from other EU MS in calling on the EU Commission to monitor market developments and deliver a comprehensive package of support to address the current difficulties in the Irish and EU pigmeat sector.  The resulting package reflects the majority of the demands presented by Ireland to the Commission who awarded almost &euro;14 million in direct aid to Ireland and the maximum flexibility announced by the Commission in the use of these funds.  I am currently consulting with stakeholders on how to disburse this aid.  The reintroduction of private storage aid for pigmeat and the improved aid rates and conditions will also help to bring the market back into balance.</p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways.  Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors.  Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015.  Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.</p>  <p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level.  Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The programme which is funded by a voluntary industry levy has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector.  The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards.  This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets.  Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p>  <p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year.  In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.</p></reply>

Current FAO estimates are that world consumption of fish will grow by an average annual consumption of 17 kg per person per annum resulting in a requirement for an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  The report identifies that Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this opportunity because of our natural advantage of being adjacent to some of the most productive fishing ground in the EU.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of this opportunity we need to pursue a strategy of growing raw material supply through sustainable development of aquaculture and encouraging landings into Irish ports of quota compliant catch by other Member States.  We need to add value to that material by moving away from commodity exports and developing prepared consumer seafood products.  Last but not least, we need to effectively market Irish seafood products on world markets.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I announced a new &euro;241 million Seafood Development Programme funded by the Irish Government and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  I expect that this Programme will be adopted by the European Commission in the next month or two and I will then be rolling out a range of Schemes to promote this strategy for the seafood sector.  The new Programme involves a doubling of our levels of investment in the seafood sector and will enable us to achieve the potential identified in Foodwise 2025 and to achieve the Government&rsquo;s target of growing employment in the seafood sector by 3,000 to 14,000 by 2020.</p></reply>

The poultry sector supports around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas.  The value of primary output for the total poultry sector stood at approximately &euro;186 million in 2014.  Given that the forecast for consumer demand remains somewhat stable, estimates for 2015 stand at &euro;186 million.  Export values have increased steadily over the last few years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products.  Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected.  Irish production is forecast to remain stable during 2015 as EU and international production is estimated to increase marginally.  Poultry is normally reared under contract to processors for a pre-agreed price, which underpins a level of continuity in the supply chain, however, the impact of cereal price changes may influence output decisions by producers as the year progresses.</p><p>The poultry sector remains very competitive, and given that Ireland is over 100% self-sufficient in poultry meat and 85% self-sufficient in egg production it is important to have the edge provided by Bord Bia`s Quality Assurance Scheme.  This is an integrated scheme involving the producer and the processing plant working in partnership to provide the customer with quality assured product.<b></b>With almost 96% of all poultry and egg producer members of the Scheme, a strong and resilient home market is critically important for the success of the industry.  In the current economic climate consumers regard poultry as a value-for-money food and the inherent added value this Scheme gives to the product does not escape the consumer.</p><p>The new Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 (RDP) is a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  In relation to the poultry sector, the main areas for support in the RDP includes:</p><p>- Significant support for on-farm capital investment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme II (TAMS II) scheme;</p><p>- Knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, and TAMS II entails financial support to a number of key areas within agriculture, including the poultry sector.  Under TAMS II, energy investments, water meters and medicine dispensers are envisaged for the poultry sector.  Support for Knowledge Transfer Groups also covers a number of sectors, including the poultry sector.  These groups will cover issues such as financial/risk management, animal health and welfare, breed improvement, environmental protection, climate change and innovation and their operation will largely mirror existing templates already in operation in the beef and sheep sectors.  The poultry sector, amongst other sectors, may also avail of support under the Targeted Animal Health and Welfare Advisory Measure.</p></reply>

A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield).  This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.  The new Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2020 at the latest.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries resources exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Stock Book informs us that in relation to stocks of a healthy biological state, there was an improvement in 2014 compared with 2013 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure indicators.  In all 73 stocks are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute.  This is an increase from 59 stocks last year, mainly due to the addition of a number of skates and rays stocks.  There is a higher number, 25 stocks, assessed to be sustainably fished in 2014, up from 20 last year.  The proportion remains the same due to the higher number of stocks being assessed overall this year.  The number of stocks overfished has also increased from 14 in 2013 to 22 in 2014.  This is due to the inclusion of 4 new stocks (rays and sea bass) and 4 stocks have gone from unknown status or underfished to overfished.  The number of stocks with unknown status is 26, which is similar to last year.</p>  <p>  In respect of the biomass of stocks, that is the quantity of mature fish in the sea, approximately one quarter, or 17 stocks are in a positive state with above biomass trigger points.  The number of depleted stocks has increased from 7 to 12 and now 16% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  The number of stocks with unknown Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB), no assessments or undefined maximum rate of fishing mortality (Fmsy) remains relatively high involving 44 stocks.  Many of these stocks have good information on biomass trends and this informs scientific advice for the stocks.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Stock Book is due to issue in November 2015 and it is expected that these early indications are that these positive trends will continue.</p>  <p>  A Key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This will be phased in gradually, applying by 2020 at the latest for all stocks.  This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen.</p></reply>

The ending of milk quota regime represented an exceptional opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and reach the 50% target set out in Food Harvest 2020.  The abolition of milk quotas allows dairy farmers capitalise on the on farm improvements which they have engaged in over recent years, covering improved genetics, more compact calving patterns and better grassland management.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that milk prices have dropped so soon after the abolition of milk quotas, but it would be disingenuous of anybody to suggest that the reduction in world prices is as a direct result of the abolition of milk quotas.  It is accepted by analysts that price volatility will be a feature of the world dairy markets and we are currently at the lower end of that volatility curve.</p>  <p>  In recent times I have made a number of proposals to the Commission to deal with the current downturn in prices and I welcome the steps taken by it, including extensions to the dates for Aids to Private Storage and Intervention, and the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion, and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers.</p>  <p>  In terms of market, the medium to long term forecast for global dairy prices remains very positive.  I am confident that the building blocks are in place to allow the Irish dairy sector to be more competitive and take full advantage of the opportunity presented by expanding global population and demand.</p></reply>

The development of programmes such as Food Academy and Food Works and promotional ventures such as the Artisan Market at Bloom and the three year 'Discover Farmhouse Cheese' promotion funded by the trade, the EU and my Departmentare assisting small producers to build food and drink businesses.</p><p>Identity is important to the future development and expansion of the artisan sector. So the publication by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of Guidance Note No. 29 setting out a definition of the term Artisan/artisanal is significant. Artisan businesses are defined as micro-enterprises with a turnover up to &euro;2m, employing fewer than 10 people and producing food in limited quantities (weekly average under 1,000 kg or litres ) using skilled craftspeople, a traditional method and characteristic ingredient(s) produced within 100 km. (). The Note also defines the terms Farmhouse, Traditional and Natural. </p><p>The FSAI definition was included in Food Wise 2025, the agrifood development strategy launched in July, which recognises the highly fragmented nature of the artisan/small business sector, which encompasses a diverse range of food and drink products, and identifies the opportunities offered by the resurgent interest in locally sourced foods, local food networks and short supply chains. These have led to an evolution of food markets and festivals, which often act as incubation units for start-up food and drink businesses.</p><p>Food Wise 2025 recommends actions to help the artisan sector to realise its potential, including festival markets, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights and programmes to assist producers to extend their business reach. The commencement of the Ascent programme, a partnership between Bord Bia and PWC to support small food companies to scale their businesses, is one such programme. It will contribute to the implementation of Food Wise by the development agencies, Departments and the food sector and to delivery of sustainable growth.</p></reply>

The design of the measure has been informed by experience from previous discussion groups, extensive stakeholder consultation, and the relevant EU regulations. Participants are required to attend Knowledge Transfer Group meetings and complete a Farm Improvement Plan. I believe that the combination of both farmer knowledge exchange meetings and one to one interaction between the farmer and advisor in the development of a Farm Improvement Plan will ensure the transfer and exchange of information and best practice to participating farmers.    As currently constituted, participation in more than one Knowledge Transfer Group across sectors is not permitted. This is largely due to potential double funding which would arise from the completion of more than one Farm Improvement Plan for a single farming enterprise. I have, however, asked my officials to examine how farmers could participate in more than one Knowledge Transfer group across two sectors, while at the same time avoiding double funding issues. </p>  <p>  The issue of allowing a named nominee to attend a Knowledge Transfer Group has been raised on a number of occasions. Following on from further consideration of this issue, an appropriate named nominee will now be allowed to attend meetings in the place of a farmer participating in a Knowledge Transfer Group. This would include spouses/partners or children of 18 years or more.   </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to consult with relevant stakeholders in order to ensure the most efficient and effective roll out of the Knowledge Transfer Groups.</p></reply>

However, the Act prohibits the hunting of animals which have been released in an injured, mutilated or exhausted condition. In addition, Section 25 of the Act provides for the establishment of codes of practice and for the adoption of codes published by other persons for the purposes of providing practical guidance relating to any aspect of the Act, including fox hunting. The Irish Masters of Foxhounds Association has a detailed code of conduct in place in respect of the hunting of foxes. This code places responsibility on member packs to ensure that the highest standards of animal welfare and good behaviour are maintained at all times.  My Department will, in due course, be engaging with all the hunting associations with a view to adopting codes under Section 25 of the Act in order to ensure that those who participate in hunting will continue to honour their obligations to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship and good behaviour at all times.   </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person can receive a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and, on indictment, &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years. There are fixed penalty payments for lesser offences. The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. In its review of the Garda Station Network which informed the Programme, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.</p>  <p>  As part of the Programme, there were a total of  twelve station closures in the  Kerry Division in 2012 and 2013. There were no station closures during 2011. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total estimated direct savings since 2011 on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of these stations is &euro;108,000. This does not, of course, represent the full value of the Programme. The closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  </p>  <p>  I am further informed that local Garda management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p></reply>

It is then the responsibility of that Department to administer their transfer list and consider candidates as and when suitable vacancies arise.</p>  <p>  Due to the large variation in the range and circumstances of staff transfers each year, it is not possible to readily isolate the numbers and breakdown sought by the Deputy in respect of transfers requests to Department or State agency offices located outside the Dublin region and attempting to retrieve this information would involve a disproportionate dedication of staff resources.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that where possible my Department will facilitate such transfer requests however the priority will always be to maintain a balanced and appropriate level of staff resources in priority areas and to match people with the most relevant skills to the requirements of posts.</p></reply>

This can include survivors of domestic violence who are transitioning from emergency services to a new, permanent home. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and Tusla recently met with Respond, at the housing association&rsquo;s request, to discuss the situation in Cuan &Aacute;lainn. The Department sought additional information from Respond, including information in relation to the housing association's financial well being. The most recent information provided indicates that Respond, which is made up of two companies, remains in good financial health. </p>  <p>  I hope that the matter can be satisfactorily resolved, by allowing sufficient time for all avenues to be explored by the relevant parties.

I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has recently concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is ongoing to develop an appropriate model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with special needs in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has highlighted.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme   will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12million, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5million.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. </p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>-  the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>-  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia. The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.</p>  <p>-  Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia. The most recent meeting of this Monitoring Group was held on 24 September 2015.</p>  <p>  The question of funding for dementia services next year is being considered as part of the Estimates Process 2016 which is currently underway, and the recommendations received have been noted in this context.</p></reply>

Nevertheless as with all capital projects, the CNU infrastructure programme which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.Therefore the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced by project is to ensure that the HSE has flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  This enables the HSE, to leverage its capital allocation more efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.</p></reply>

The new hospital will be co-located with St. James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, which will re-locate to the campus in due course. Satellite centres of the hospital, providing urgent and outpatient care, are to be built on the campuses of Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Government's decision that the new children's hospital should be co-located with St. James's on its campus in Dublin 8 was clinically led. In 2006 McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, which recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and secondly by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff. A number of subsequent reviews and reports on this project over the years since 2006, most recently the 2012 Dolphin report, reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital. This was a critical factor in the Government&rsquo;s decision in November 2012 that the new hospital should be co-located with St. James&rsquo;s, as the hospital with the widest range of clinical specialties and national services from an adult perspective, and an excellent and well established research and education culture and infrastructure.</p>  <p>  On 10 August 2015 the NPHDB submitted a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, subject to planning, it is hoped to be on site at all three locations in early 2016.  During the design process, there were extensive consultations  with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff of the existing hospitals, with clinical leads and with local residents. This process has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people, while also seeking to provide a pleasant environment for staff and families. All in-patient accommodation will be in single en-suite rooms, with in-room parent accommodation, while the planning application also includes a family hostel to be located on the campus. The main hospital on the St. James&rsquo;s campus will have 1,000 basement car spaces as well as excellent public transport connections, and a Mobility Management Plan is being introduced on the hospital campus to manage the increase in traffic associated with the new children's hospital. A 3D walkthrough of the hospital can be seen on www.newchildrenshospital.ie while the complete planning application can be viewed on nchplanning.ie. There is also a drop-in centre at 568 South Circular Road where a 3D model can be seen.</p></reply>

This delivers on a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.</p>  <p>The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017. This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme   will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12million, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5million.</p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>-  the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;</p>  <p>-  the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia. The resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.</p>  <p>-  Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.</p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme. This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. The Group also includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia. The most recent meeting of this Monitoring Group was held on 24 September 2015.</p>  <p>  The question of funding for dementia services next year is being considered as part of the Estimates Process 2016 which is currently underway, and the recommendations received have been noted in this context.</p></reply>

In addition, schools in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) Band 1 category also receive an additional base allocation of 0.4 of a post if the school has 200 or more pupils or an additional 0.2 of a post if the school has less than 200 pupils.</p>  <p>  The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls.</p>  <p>  Whereas some enhanced allocations are provided to schools to account for gender and disadvantage differentials, schools of similar size, which have the same criteria, receive the same allocation rates and are not discriminated against.</p>  <p>  My Departments Circular 02/05 provides guidance to schools on the utilisation of resources allocated to them under the GAM. It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal. Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the workload issue and the pressures on Principals teachers. My Department has done work at helping to ease the administrative burden on school principals. The development and introduction of the primary online database is a significant step forward in this regard.

They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Individual pupil results are not reported to the Department.</p>  <p>  Standardised tests are available for reading (in English and Irish) and mathematics at primary level in Ireland. These scientifically constructed tests can provide teachers and parents with information about how well a child's achievement compares with that of children at the same class level in Irish primary schools and the rate of progress that they have made over time.</p>  <p>  Standardised tests are one important tool that teachers can use to monitor pupil progress. They do not measure the progress pupils have made in achieving many other important learning outcomes, including, for example, students' oral language abilities or their ability to write creatively.</p>  <p>  Aggregating standardised test scores for pupils within different classes can help to inform a school's planning, self-evaluation and external evaluation.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  These measures were implemented at time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.</p>  <p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.</p>  <p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement has, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begun the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers. The LRA proposals have been accepted by the INTO and are currently under consideration by the post-primary teacher unions, ASTI and TUI.</p></reply>

These draft revisions proposed: </p>  <p>-  the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments, </p>  <p>-  a mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and </p>  <p>-  the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p>  <p>  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until February 21 2014.  My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible.  In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.

The aim of these measures is to ensure delivery of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the mortgage arrears challenge and in particular to make available a range of options to distressed borrowers and to keep as many people in their homes as possible.  Measures announced include:</p><p>- Improvements to the operations of the courts both in terms of procedures and powers; </p><p>Improvements to the operation of the Personal Insolvency Service; </p><p>- Ensuring that the necessary information is made available to those in mortgage arrears by strengthening the role of MABS and providing expert advice to borrowers; </p><p>- The introduction of measures to assist those in rented accommodation that is subject to a repossession order; </p><p>- A communications campaign to ensure that those in mortgage arrears are fully aware of their options; </p><p>- The strengthening of existing schemes including the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and ensuring that those in need of social housing have their eligibility assessed without delay. </p><p>While responsibility for these measures is spread across a number of Departments, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme falls under my remit.  Improvements include a broadening of the property value thresholds to ensure that more properties qualify, introducing flexibility in relation to the size of properties that qualify and a changing of the rules with regard to negative equity to enable those with a marginal positive equity to also qualify. </p><p>With regard to the rent and purchase option put forward by the Deputy, while my Department is now focusing on the delivery of progress under the new measures in place, there will be a need to review progress on a regular basis.  I will ensure that the merits of the proposal offered are considered in the light of any future reviews.</p></reply>

In a joint position paper on lead published by the EPA and HSE in 2013, it is recommended that all lead pipes and plumbing in public and in private ownership should be replaced over time. The joint position paper also recommends that persons in premises with lead piping should, in the meantime, flush the supply at the kitchen tap first thing in the morning before using it. The full document is available to download from the HSE&rsquo;s website at: .</p><p>On 9 June 2015, I announced a Government-approved National Strategy to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water. The Strategy was prepared by my Department and the Department of Health in consultation with Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA, in order to map the scale of the problem and identify measures to mitigate any risks to human health posed by lead in drinking water. As part of the Strategy, I will be establishing a new grant aid scheme to assist low income households to replace lead pipes in their homes. Funding for the scheme will be finalised in the context of Budget 2016 and it is envisaged that the scheme will be administered by the local authorities. Income thresholds and other eligibility criteria will apply and the terms and conditions of the new scheme will be publicised as soon as they are finalised.</p></reply>

The national rollout of services commenced in 2012, following a successful pilot project, and was completed in 2014. Services were rolled out incrementally, as follows:-    2012 - 14 Western and Midlands Counties</p>  <p>  2013 - Dublin, Meath and Kildare</p>  <p>  2014 - 9 Southern Counties. </p>  <p>  Some 780 schools (including all post-primary, post-leaving certificate, hospital schools, as well as special schools with post-primary students) across the country have a 100Mbps connection. Additionally, 20 Educational Centres have been facilitated with a 100Mbps connection under this programme to help assist with the delivery of Continued Professional Development (CPD) for teachers. </p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a Government initiative which aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland. This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest. </p>  <p>  On Tuesday 29 September last, the Government approved an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan, which will provide the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention. Combined with commercial investment, this will ensure that 85% of Ireland's premises have high speed broadband by 2018, with 100% coverage by 2020.</p>  <p>  The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which was published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention. It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned. There are over 1,500 schools in the target area for the intervention, most of which are primary schools. </p>  <p>It is intended that the network will be built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.

Since 2009, the programme has supported the renovation of nearly 300,000 homes in Ireland.  The upgrade of windows is not currently supported under the Better Energy Programme due to the need to balance the limited budgetary resources available with the demands for the schemes delivered under the programme. Therefore, the measures currently supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost. While window insulation does improve the energy efficiency of a home, the cost of such a measure is high in relation to the energy efficiency gains made.

In that regard, a review of the current legislative provisions was initiated to ensure that they remain both effective and balanced. The submissions received, during a public consultation process on the matter, have been published on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at <i>http://</i>.</p><p>Following the end of the public consultation period, I established a Working Group, consisting of officials from my Department, to consider the submissions received and to report back to me with a range of proposals.
