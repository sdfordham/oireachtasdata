This is on the back of the Euro Area summit statement of 29 June of this year.  All options for restructuring the notes are being considered including the terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.  The future payment of the State under the Promissory Note arrangements will be dependent on the outcome of the on-going discussions and the work undertaken in this area is one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities.</p><p>  With regard to the 2012 IBRC Promissory Note payment which was by way of Irish Government Bonds, the repurchase agreement with Bank of Ireland was for one year, ending 19 June 2013.</p><p>  I may remind Deputies that the Government, together along with all other 26 member States at the Euro Summit in October last year committed that: &quot;As far as our general approach to private sector involvement in the euro area is concerned, we reiterate our decision taken on 21 July 2011 that Greece requires an exceptional and unique solution. All other euro area Member States solemnly reaffirm their inflexible determination to honour fully their own individual sovereign signature and all their commitments to sustainable fiscal conditions and structural reforms. The euro area Heads of State fully support this determination as the credibility of all their sovereign signatures is a decisive element for ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole.&quot;  </p><p>  The Irish Government will honour this commitment and will ensure that we work with our EU partners to address the situation in relation to the overall cost to the State of resolving the difficulties in our banking sector. This Government has consistently worked towards a consensual approach to decisions made with our European colleagues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-15a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111500047#WRA00900"><p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are very mindful of the unfair competitive advantage to be gained by those businesses that do not fulfil their tax obligations. Revenue&rsquo;s tax and duty compliance programmes are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow economy.    Regarding the estimated loss to the Exchequer in 2011 and to date in 2012, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that given the nature of the shadow economy, there is no reliable system to measure the tax loss due to shadow economy activities. I am further informed that Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through a range of compliance and audit interventions including targeted special projects. A variety of methodologies are used by Revenue to identify those who are operating in the shadow economy including covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as prearranged aspect queries on specific items. In addition, joint operations are conducted with the Department of Social Protection using Joint Investigation Units and there is a strong focus on cash businesses, given its potential high-risk nature.</p><p>  I am confident that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme that is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion in all its forms. In 2011, Revenue committed additional resources to tackling tax evasion in high-risk sectors and carried out over 11,000 audits and more than 546,000 assurance checks which between them yielded more than &euro;483 million. Included in these numbers are the results of a particular focus on shadow economy activity in certain sectors:</p><p>- Construction: 1,833 audits yielding &euro;58.8m</p><p>- Bars and restaurants: 613 audits yielding &euro;16.9m</p><p>- Legal activities: 142 audits yielding &euro;4.6m</p><p>- Landlords/rental properties: 908 audits yielding &euro;35.1m</p><p>- Professionals (accountants, doctors, dentists): 350 audits yielding &euro;8.9m.</p><p>  Revenue also prioritises the tackling evasion of taxes and duties in the oil and tobacco sectors. In 2012 to date, eleven oil laundries have been detected and in excess of one hundred and ninety nine thousand litres of fuel have been seized from these. Also, to date this year, thirty-eight filling stations have been closed down. During 2011, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service seized a total of 109m cigarettes from 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4m cigarettes. Revenue also seized 11,158kg of tobacco in 2011.</p><p>  Finally, I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they hold regular meetings with trade and representative bodies through The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group where the risks posed by shadow economy activities are discussed. The Deputy should also note that changes are frequently made in tax legislation aimed at counteracting shadow economy activity. Two recent examples are the introduction of the electronic Relevant Contracts Tax regime and an enhanced penalty regime for employers who fail to operate PAYE regulations fully.</p></reply>

The eighth review mission took place from Tuesday October 16th to Thursday October 25th 2012. In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all of the commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognized by the Troika.   My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Brendan Howlin T.D., and I met with the EU-IMF delegation during the recent quarterly review of the EU / IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland. These meetings were also attended by senior officials from both Departments. A wide range of topics was covered at these meetings, including financial reforms, structural reforms, economic developments and the progress of the Programme. In addition, the nature of the review mission is that it involves a large number of technical meetings which were attended by officials from my Department, and when appropriate from other Departments, the Central Bank and the NTMA.</p><p>  The quarterly review process is an integral part of our EU-IMF support programme. The process starts with a review mission and ends with consideration and approval by the EU (Commission and Council) and the IMF Executive Board.  Following each review mission the external partners and the Irish authorities agree updated programme documents, specifically the Letters of Intent, the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. Once finalised, the Letters of Intent are signed jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank and are issued to the EU and the IMF, along with the accompanying programme documents.  These documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed on the Department of Finance website following their transmission. The process is expected to conclude in December.</p><p>  I would also point out that contacts at official level between the Irish authorities and the EU, the ECB and the IMF concerning the support programme continue between review missions.</p></reply>

AIB is currently approving seven out of ten mortgage applications and is well ahead of target in terms of its aim to provide new mortgage lending of at least &euro;1 billion sanctions in 2012. In addition, AIB&rsquo;s mortgage rates for new business remain the most competitive in the market.</p><p>  AIB&rsquo;s share of mortgage loans drawn in quarter three 2012 is estimated at 43% compared to 25% in quarter three 2011. It has sanctioned 5,922 mortgages in the year to Sept 2012, a rise of 90% on the same period last year. AIB&rsquo;s share of the broker market is now estimated to be 66%.</p><p>  First Time Buyers form a significant part of AIB&rsquo;s mortgage business with market share of 49% in quarter 3 2012, compared to 27% in Q3 2011. AIB&rsquo;s improved turnaround time for completed applications has been central to this market performance.</p><p>  As potential buyers need to complete the purchase of a property by 31st December 2012 to avail of Tax Relief for Mortgage Interest Paid, all aspects of the transaction must be finalised including Legal, conveyancing, Life Assurance and mortgage drawdown.</p><p>  Any new home buyer who is concerned about any issue in relation to their mortgage application should contact their Relationship Manager or Mortgage Co-ordinator who are always available to support customers in this major financial and personal decision.</p></reply>

The Deputy might be aware that the Programme for Government does contain a clear commitment requiring all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. I would also remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.</p><p>  Furthermore, cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on,   amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities.  The Deputy might also be aware that a distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on income levels.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-15a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111500047#WRA01700"><p>The European Council in October reaffirmed that "the Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns."  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel spoke together following the October European Council and discussed the unique circumstances behind Ireland&rsquo;s banking and sovereign debt crisis, and Ireland&rsquo;s plans for a full return to the markets. They reaffirmed the commitment from June 29th to task the Eurogroup to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well performing adjustment programme. They recognised, in this context, that Ireland is a special case, and that the Eurogroup will take that into account. The Taoiseach also had a good discussion of these issues with President Hollande on 22 October.</p><p>  When my colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, and I met with German Federal Minister for Finance, Dr. Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, on 29 October in Dublin, this was also discussed, with Minister Sch&auml;uble publicly echoing his support for the communiqu&eacute; issued by the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel.</p><p>  I also had the opportunity to meet the incoming Minister for Finance of the Netherlands at this week&rsquo;s Ecofin meeting.</p><p>  With regard to my comments at the Joint Finance Committee in relation to the ESM, the fund is to be given the capability of recapitalising banks directly. However the primary decision that was made at the meeting on June 29 was for banking union, which will involve the establishment of an effective Single Supervisory Mechanism across the Euro area. </p><p>  The establishment of this new supervisory mechanism is a prerequisite for direct banking recapitalisation, and so it has become obvious that reaching an outcome here will take longer than our discussions in relation to the promissory notes.  Aside from the issue of when this new instrument will become available, there is a host of other issues that have yet to be worked through such as how the ESM would run these banks, what governance arrangements would be put in place between the fund and the banks themselves and indeed between the ESM and Member State governments. We need to consider these wider considerations in the months ahead and this is what I was referring to at the recent Finance Committee.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-15a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111500047#WRA02100"><p>The imposition of lending restrictions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  </p><p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions advises me that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns about the operation of these individual credit unions and the resultant risk to members&rsquo; savings. The number of lending restrictions is a reflection of the Registrar&rsquo;s concerns about lending practices in the sector. </p><p>  The Registrar has advised that currently about 57% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions.  Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, over 68% can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member which is a sizeable amount and should cover most circumstances. </p><p>  Fewer than 2.5% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member, and fewer than 1% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;5,000 per member. These are the cases where the Registrar has more significant concerns in terms of risk to members&rsquo; savings.</p><p>  Commercial lending restrictions apply to approximately 40% of credit unions reflecting the need to limit credit union exposure to higher risk lending where skills and expertise are not adequate.</p><p>  The Registrar has also advised that individual credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.</p></reply>

I have no statutory role in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy.  It is a commercial matter for each bank concerned.  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. However, the Central Bank has<i></i>  no statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged by regulated entities apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997. </p><p>  The lending institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities. Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including, interest rates and products is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in some banks, it is imperative that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State.</p></reply>

The Deputy might be aware that the Programme for Government does contain a clear commitment requiring all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions. I would also remind the Deputy that the State and its bodies must, of course, comply with all provisions of equality legislation in the development and delivery of policies and services.</p><p>  Furthermore, cabinet procedures require that proposals put to Government indicate clearly whether there is any impact of the proposal on,   amongst other things, gender equality, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities.</p><p>  The Deputy might also be aware that a distributional analysis of proposed budget measures is performed each year based on income levels.   I also feel that is important to highlight the progressive nature of the Irish taxation system when discussing these matters. Research by the ESRI has shown that, when analysing the impacts of policy changes since the beginning of the crisis, losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on the highest incomes, and smaller for those on low incomes. In other words, the measures have been progressive in nature.</p><p>  The research also acknowledged the overall distributional pattern of Irish austerity measures as among the most progressive in 6 EU countries examined in a recent study by the European Commission.</p><p>  It is also worth acknowledging that Ireland has been consistently assessed highly by the OECD for the progressivity of our taxation system. In the OECD rating system on the progressivity of taxation, where less than 100 is regressive and above 100 is progressive, most EU countries had a progressivity rate of between 120 and 140. Ireland, in comparison, had a progressivity rate of 182.</p></reply>

The Statement of 29th June also stated that it has been agreed that when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly. This would be dependent on appropriate conditionality, including compliance with state aid rules, which should be institution-specific, sector-specific or economy-wide    and would be formalised in a memorandum of understanding.</p><p>  Work is continuing at a technical level to put in place both the single supervisory mechanism, and the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility, at the earliest possible date. Ireland is participating constructively in these technical discussions.</p><p>  The most recent European Council on 18/19 October 2012 concluded that: &quot;The Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. When an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly.&quot;  It is important from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, that progress towards these goals is made as quickly as possible, and as I have already mentioned we are playing our full part in this work. </p><p>  The implications of any ESM participation in Irish banking recapitalisation are being considered as part of our overall approach to these discussions. However, at this stage it is not possible to form a definitive view on this matter.   The government is pursuing a twin track approach in relation to our banking related debt with the other track designed to secure a better deal on the promissory notes in IBRC. Both routes are designed to enhance our well performing adjustment programme and put Ireland&rsquo;s economy and indebtedness on a more sustainable path.</p></reply>

However   the Joint Administrators when presenting their 10th report to the High Court in July 2012 indicated that the potential call on the ICF could be up to &#8364;1.65bn.  The Joint Administrators pointed out in their report that the projected call on the ICF now includes accounting adjustments and  considerable contingencies which it is hoped will not be called upon. They indicated that if they were to remove most of the accounting adjustments and use a &#8220;<i>best estimate</i>  &#8221; calculation, then the call on the fund is likely to be in the range of &#8364;1.1bn to &#8364;1.3bn rather than the &#8364;1.65bn for which they have provided. </p><p>  I have been advised that the Joint Administrators have undertaken a number of actions in relation to claims settlement which can reduce the ultimate claims cost. These include as part of a new enhanced governance structure the establishment of a Claims Advisory Committee (CAC) to guide and advise them and QIL management on future claims strategy and policy.  </p><p>  Furthermore, to protect the Exchequer interests I have ensured that the State Claims Agency is more involved in the administration process, particularly in the claims management area, which is critical to keeping the call on the ICF down to its lowest level possible. In this respect it should be noted that, at my request, Mr Ciaran Breen, Director of the State Claims Agency has been appointed as Chair of the Claims Advisory Committee. </p><p>  My Department proposes to continue to work with the Joint Administrators and to use the services of the State Claims Agency to monitor progress with a view to ensuring, in as much as it can that the most cost effective outcome to this process is achieved.</p></reply>

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions. While fuel prices remain relatively high we have in recent times experienced a decline in prices.   Any reduction in excise would give rise to significant costs to the Exchequer which would have to be met from increasing revenue in other areas.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of the review, at this stage, is approximately &euro;120,000.</p><p>  The object of the review is to thoroughly review all remuneration practices at the covered institutions with the object of simplifying remuneration and compensation structures, discouraging excessive risk-taking and to better align pay and reward to long term value creation.  Present Government policy on remuneration dictates that no employee, at the covered institutions may receive more than &euro;500,000 (excluding pension contributions) per annum and remains in force.</p><p>  Numerous engagements by my officials and Mercer have taken place since the awarding of the contract.  I am expecting the consultant&rsquo;s report to be delivered by year end whereupon consultations with the various stakeholders will commence. </p><p>  As I have said previously, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and have committed to placing the details underpinning the review into the public domain.</p></reply>

As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.  Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.   As the Deputy will be aware, the terms of the Relationship Frameworks with AIB, Bank of Ireland, IBRC and Permanent TSB set out the form of the on-going relationship between the State and these institutions. We have been operating under these framework agreements since March 2012. Any changes to the Relationship Frameworks would require the approval of the Competition Division of the European Commission. </p><p>  As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.</p></reply>

This is slightly lower than my Department&rsquo;s most recent forecast, published yesterday in the Medium Term Fiscal Statement (MTFS), which projected real GDP growth of 1.5% for the year as a whole. I would point out however that some domestic commentators have recently suggested growth of 2.1% next year. The consensus forecast, the median of the private sector forecasts, at the end of October was 1.5%.   The achievement of fiscal targets is driven by a range of factors, including overall economic performance as well as specific developments which effect revenue and expenditure patterns in a given year. </p><p>  Broadly speaking, nominal GDP developments drive revenue growth, and nominal GDP growth has been slightly above expectations this year. These developments in nominal GDP are one of the reasons why, notwithstanding lower real growth forecasts, the Commission is still projecting a similar deficit to my Department for next year.</p><p>  Under the revised Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) Recommendation issued by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010, the State&rsquo;s General Government deficit must not exceed 7.5% of GDP in 2013. On the basis of the most up-to-date economic and fiscal data available, the deficit limit is viewed as being achievable on the basis of the implementation of the &euro;3.5 billion consolidation package in 2013, as outlined in the MTFS.</p><p>Ireland is committed to implementing further consolidation in the coming years in order to correct our excessive deficit, put debt on a downward trajectory and sustain investor confidence. This should assist in keeping the cost of borrowing as low as possible so as to minimise the cost to the taxpayer of debt interest payments. Indications of the success of this approach are already evident in the form of the lowering of bond yields since early summer and the NTMA&rsquo;s continuing access to the debt markets.</p></reply>

However, RCT applies to all construction works ranging from major construction projects to general repair works. Repair work includes the replacement of constituent parts of a building or structure.  Maintenance on the other hand includes cleaning, removal of graffiti and the unblocking of drains, etc.   The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors. RCT plays an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate to introduce a threshold for this type of work.</p><p>  In the light of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT system, the Revenue Commissioners have made available detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for Boards of Management regarding the operation of RCT.  These guidance notes, which clarify the position in relation to repair work and maintenance work, have been published on the Revenue website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility, which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system. This has significantly reduced the administrative burden associated with RCT.</p><p>  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT system is implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.</p></reply>

In addition the receipt of preference share dividends from Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks lowered the General Government Deficit in 2009 by &#8364;387 million.   In 2009 the General Government Deficit was worsened by the &#8364;4 billion capital injection into the then Anglo Irish Bank. In addition, the National Pensions Reserve Fund invested &#8364;3.5 billion each in both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.

Eleven Member States (Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia) have addressed formal requests to the Commission indicating that they wish to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of a common system of Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) and that the Commission should submit a proposal to the Council to that end.<font color="#0000FF">  </font>On 23 October 2012 the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council Decision to authorise enhanced cooperation in the area of financial transaction tax.  The European Parliament will have to consent to the use of &#8220;enhanced co-operation&#8221; in this area.  It is for the Council Presidency and the European Parliament to decide when they will take their respective votes on the issue.  The &#8220;enhanced co-operation&#8221; member states have requested that the scope and objectives of the revised FTT proposal should be based on the Commission's original proposal of September 2011, although the Commission may decide to adjust some elements to reflect the fact that the FTT will be implemented by fewer than 27 Member States.</p><p>  The original EU Commission FTT proposal was a residence based tax &#8211; that is, a transaction would be subject to the tax if one of the parties was a financial institution which is resident in one of the Member States.  I requested the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and the Central Bank to prepare an assessment of the Commission&#8217;s original FTT proposal to implement an FTT in the EU.  Sections 2 and 3 of the ESRI/Central Bank report, which was circulated to Oireachtas Members earlier this year, discuss the residence basis of the tax.  The Commission proposal did not envisage that the FTT would be charged on an issuance basis &#8211; that is, by reference to whether the company whose shares were being transferred, or whose shares were subject to a derivative transaction, was resident or registered in an EU Member State.</p><p>  The European Parliament has proposed that the FTT should operate on both a residence basis and an issuance basis, so that a transaction would be liable to an FTT if it was carried out by a financial institution in an EU Member State or if it involved a transfer of shares or a derivative transaction related to shares in a company registered in an EU Member State.  While the Council (comprising representatives of the EU member state Governments) is obliged to consult the European Parliament before adopting a final position on Commission proposals, the European Parliament specifically does not have co-legislator status for proposals in the taxation area, as it would for example with co-decision proposals in other areas.</p><p>  There is no revised FTT proposal from the Commission at this point &#8211; only a proposal to introduce an FTT by enhanced co-operation, rather than a proposal outlining the shape of the FTT itself.  It is therefore not yet clear what form the &#8220;enhanced co-operation FTT&#8221; will take.  I do not propose to request a further analysis unless and until the Commission issues a revised proposal, and any decision to request a further analysis will depend on the form that proposal takes.  I do not propose to request an analysis of a measure which has not yet been formally proposed.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland will not be one of the enhanced co-operation countries but we will continue to monitor discussions on the FTT to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions, including our Stamp Duty; and with a view to protecting our existing financial services business.</p></reply>

A standard format for the SFS was developed by the IBF and MABS and approved by the Central Bank in 2011. All lenders are required to use this SFS when dealing with consumers under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  The SFS is a key component to the effectiveness of the MARP as it requires consumers to objectively assess their incomings and outgoings, assets and liabilities and it provides the lender with valuable information regarding the financial position of the borrower.  The standard format for the SFS requires a comprehensive review of the borrower&rsquo;s financial position and brings increased consistency to the process and ensures that all assessments of a borrower&rsquo;s case are based on a common analysis of their financial circumstances.</p><p>  Guidance has been prepared for consumers by MABS and the Central Bank which informs the borrower of the importance of completing the SFS and also the commitment of their lender to assist them with the process.</p><p>  The Central Bank has undertaken to conduct a review of the CCMA to commence in 2013, and any operational issues that arise with this standard SFS will be addressed on this basis.</p><p>  There is currently no commonly applied definition of necessary living costs in use by mortgage lenders.

AIB is committed to ensuring that all elements of pay, including base pay and benefits, are in line with the bank&rsquo;s operating performance and recognise the materially altered environment for Bank&rsquo;s operating in Ireland.

There has been wide-spread acknowledgement of our commitment to the Programme, a commitment evidenced by the fact that we have met all of our Programme conditions to date.  Ireland&#8217;s exit from our programme of financial support will represent a success for both Ireland and the broader Euro-zone. Continuation of our strong implementation record to date is critical to such a successful exit.</p><p>  There is a very keen awareness, by Member States, of the difficulties faced by programme countries, and the efforts being made are well recognised and acknowledged.</p><p>  Our strong performance has already been recognised in a tangible way. The agreement on 21 July 2011 by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government to reduce to reduce the interest rates to close to the cost of funding and extend the maturity of the EFSF loans, has been reflected in similar changes to the terms of the EFSM loans. They were also reflected in the interest rates for the bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.</p><p>The Euro-area Heads of State or Government agreed on 29th June this year that &#8220;<i>it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&#8221;. </i> The Statement of 29th June also stated that it has been agreed that when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly.  The establishment of a single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks is a prerequisite for any direct recapitalisation facility.</p><p>  Discussions are continuing at a technical level to put in place both the single supervisory mechanism, and the European Stability Mechanism&#8217;s direct banking recapitalisation facility, at the earliest possible date. Ireland is participating constructively in these technical discussions.</p><p>  The most recent European Council on 18/19 October 2012 concluded that:</p><p>  &#8220;The Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. When an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks directly.&#8221;</p><p>  Given that the establishment of the single new supervisory mechanism is a pre-requisite for direct banking recapitalisation, it has become obvious that reaching an outcome here will take longer than our discussions in relation to the promissory notes.  Aside from the issue of when this new instrument would become available, there is a host of other issues that have yet to be worked through such as how the ESM would run these banks, what governance arrangements would be put in place between the fund and the banks themselves and indeed between the ESM and Member State governments. We will need to examine these wider considerations in the months ahead.</p><p>  It is important from Ireland&#8217;s perspective, that progress towards these goals is made as quickly as possible, and as I have already mentioned we are playing our full part in this work.</p><p>  We take every opportunity to promote Ireland&#8217;s case for improved terms on the cost of our banking support measures, through contacts at Ministerial, Diplomatic and official level.</p></reply>

The key strategic conclusion of the Keane Report was that there should not be a blanket debt forgiveness approach but that instead the focus should be on the development, by both lenders and the State, of measures that will be of assistance to those mortgage holders, having regard to individual circumstances, experiencing genuine difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The Government is now actively progressing the implementation of the main recommendations contained in that Report and to that end a Government committee, chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet.  Also a high level Steering Group, chaired by my Department, coordinates work at official level across the relevant Departments and the Central Bank.  The Government has accepted the overall recommendations of the Keane Report and a number of significant milestones have now been achieved in their implementation:</p><p>- Personal insolvency reform was identified in the Report as a central catalyst for the resolution of the mortgage arrears problem and it was stated that, without effective legislation in this area, the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Personal Insolvency Bill was published last June and the Bill has been progressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and D&aacute;il Report stage on the Bill has recently concluded.  It is hoped to complete all stages of the parliamentary process before the end of the year;</p><p>- The Report was also of the view that Mortgage Interest Supplement is not an appropriate long term housing support and instead it recommend, as a social housing response, the establishment of two schemes, &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; and &#8220;mortgage to lease&#8221;, for eligible households.  On foot of the recommendations, the primary focus has been on the progression of the former and a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme was launched on a pilot basis in February and this scheme was subsequently extended nationally by the Minister for Housing and Planning in June 2012.  This option is now available in appropriate cases and will be of benefit to low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable to allow that family remain in their home;</p><p>- The recommendations of the Keane Report also included, in addition to standard forbearance, a range of possible solutions such as &#8220;trade down mortgages&#8221;, &#8220;split mortgages&#8221; and &#8220;sale by agreement&#8221; that could be explored and offered by lenders if suitable to borrower and lender. A case by case approach is required in this matter and the area of sustainability will be a key factor when considering an appropriate solution in this area.  The Central Bank under its MARS project has been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they have a range of longer term options, such as those outlined in the Report or other appropriate options as may be developed by lenders, and that they have the capacity to implement effectively.  The rollout of these options commenced in the final quarter of this year with Central bank oversight;</p><p>- An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.</p></reply>

This means that a loan will have to be drawn down on or before 31 December 2012 in order to qualify for this relief.  I have no plans to review this decision and I believe that more than adequate notice of this decision has been provided.</p><p>As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.

However, the Central Bank, in the exercise of its statutory role as independent regulator and supervisor of credit institutions, has continuous involvement with all the banks from both prudential and consumer protection perspectives.     In that context, the points made by the Central Bank Director of Credit Institutions and Insurance Supervision in her speech at the Irish Banking Federation 2012 National Conference warrant particular attention.  In particular, she noted shortcomings on the part of banks in their capacity, and to some extent willingness, to fully address the mortgage arrears problem, although it should also be noted that she also indicated certain areas of progress.  The Central Bank has over the past year had intensive engagement with all mortgage lenders on the development of mortgage arrears resolution strategies.  As indicated by the Director, the Central Bank has led on this issue and I support the Bank in this leadership role as it continues to actively engage with banks on this process and in particular now that the process has reached implementation and roll out phase.  This has inevitably involved the upskilling of staff to deal with the mortgage arrears issue and this area will, I expect, continue to attract close scrutiny from the Central Bank.  </p><p>  I also expect lenders, many of which now have also had significant leadership change, to respond to the challenge made by the Director and to work with the Central Bank in the roll out of measures to assist their customers who are experiencing genuine and real mortgage distress. </p></reply>

This involves action by Member States and at EU level in order to boost growth, investment and employment.   The compact rests on three pillars. First, sustainable growth depends on sound public finances. Second, sustainable growth requires a stable financial system that allows for financing of valuable economic activity. Finally, the dedication of EU funds for investment purposes complements the growth potential-enhancing structural reforms. In ensuring progress, measures continue to be taken at European and Member State levels.</p><p>  Therefore, measures to be implemented at the national level include the full implementation of the country-specific recommendations from the European Semester as well as pursuing differentiated and growth-heeding fiscal consolidation.  From an Irish point of view, I want to assure the Deputy that Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal consolidation strategy is on track and fully appreciative of the need for growth. At the euro area level, important institutional innovations in support of Member States undertaking adjustment strategies have been implemented, notably the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism or the ECB&rsquo;s announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions, which can complement ESM assistance.</p><p>  Further, important progress has been made at both Member State and European levels to ensure financial stability. Scrutiny of EU financial institutions has been enhanced and they continue to increase their capital ratios in line with the European Banking Authority&rsquo;s capital requirement. Member States have also contributed to bolstering the capital position of banks. The ECB&rsquo;s refinancing stance also has been supportive in this process. Ireland&rsquo;s progress in regard to financial stability initiatives is well-documented.</p><p>  Aside from growth potential enhancing structural measures, a number of initiatives are to be implemented at EU level in order to boost growth. I believe the cumulative impact of all of these measures will have a positive impact in terms of supporting economic activity in the EU at this difficult juncture.  This, in turn, can be expected to benefit Ireland, including given the importance of the EU as a trading partner.</p><p>  Initiatives announced at EU level also include a deepening of the Single Market and reducing the regulatory burden.  Another important measure is the mobilisation of EUR120 billion - about 1 per cent of EU gross national income - to boost European growth. These funds will be made available via EU structural funds, European Investment Bank lending, and the 2020 Project Bonds initiative, which entered its pilot phase this November. Constituting part of these efforts is a EUR10 billion paid-in capital increase for the EIB, a substantial boost to its lending capacity. </p><p>  From a national perspective, we continue to make progress in terms of maximising the amount of funding that can be made available to Ireland in these regards. For instance, the EIB is an important source of funding to Ireland.  Funds have amounted to an average of EUR500 million per annum covering commercial semi-states, local authorities, public private partnerships, and loans to banks for on-lending to SMEs.  The Exchequer can also borrow directly from the EIB in respect of capital projects such as school-building.  So far this year, the EIB has provided funding for a EUR100 million project for the purpose of building 550 classrooms across Ireland.  The Bank also approved loan financing of EUR155 million for Bord Gais Energy. A further up to EUR200 million of part-financing of major Irish water supply and wastewater infrastructure investment for the period of 2012-15 was approved in late October and is due to be signed off on at the end of November. Projects currently under appraisal include EUR200 million for use in SME and mid-cap investment via AIB. On Friday 9 November the latest PPP project, Schools Bundle 3 was signed off on by all parties including the EIB which provided around EUR45 million loan funding for 8 new schools.  </p><p>  The Taoiseach, Ministers Noonan and Howlin, and EIB President Hoyer agreed during the EIB&rsquo;s official visit to Ireland on 6th July to set-up a joint High Level Working Group (HLWG).  The HLWG will explore how to ensure an enhanced contribution from the Bank by identifying concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda.  This joint commitment to collaboration and a structured dialogue builds on existing EIB activity in Ireland, while also recognising the opportunities presented by the forthcoming increase in the Bank&rsquo;s capital resources of EUR10 bn.  </p><p>  These opportunities will be used to help Ireland move beyond the crisis management of recent years and to plan for the creation of growth in the economy through key strategic investments in infrastructure and growth-enhancing initiatives, specifically those covered in the Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Stimulus package which was launched last July.</p></reply>

In addition, the Deputy will also be aware that competitiveness is a crucial factor in achieving sustainable growth in a small open economy, such as Ireland&#8217;s. The economy&#8217;s competitiveness is the result of a wide number of factors, with the National Competitiveness Council&#8217;s Scorecard analysing Ireland&#8217;s international competitiveness using 127 individual indicators. These range from measures such as economic growth and quality of life, to the policy inputs that will drive future competitiveness, such as the education system and the delivery of infrastructure. Taxation is one element of this policy-mix, as taxation rates impact upon the attractiveness of an economy as a place to do business and work.</p><p>  It is the standard practice for the Minister for Finance to review taxation policy in the run up to the annual Budget. It is also a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that could be the subject of Budget decisions. </p><p>  However, speaking generally, the marginal tax rate, which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base, is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy.  Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more.  The OECD in its working paper &#8216;Tax and Economic Growth&#8217;  points to the <i>&#8220;possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity&#8221;</i>  . </p></reply>

In Budget 2012, this analysis was presented in Table 5. It compares the post budget position, following the implementation of the consolidation measures, with the pre budget (or white paper) position which is published the weekend prior to the budget.</p><p>  The white paper for 2013 will be published the weekend before the budget and a table showing the impact of the budget on the fiscal position in 2013 will be published as part of the budget documentation on the 5th of December.</p><p>  It should be acknowledged that while restoring the public finances to a sound footing is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s future, consolidation can have a negative short-run impact on the economy.  However, I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is conscious of the need to minimise the impact of consolidation on the labour market and in this regard is framing Budget 2013 in such a way as to make it as job-friendly as possible. </p><p>  The short term impact on GDP as a result of the fiscal adjustment in 2013 was factored into my Department&rsquo;s forecasts released last December at Budget time, and no substantial change to estimates of this specific impacts were made in the MTFS forecast of 14 November. The downward revision to real GDP growth for 2013 to 1.5 per cent contained in the MTFS is a primarily a result of a realisation of downside risks highlighted at the time of SPU in relation to weaker international growth, and its pass-through to domestic demand.</p></reply>

The Commission also recommends that a formal process of engagement be established between the credit union representative bodies and Government to determine safe ways to invest collective credit union funds into community projects, employment initiatives and small co-operatives.   I remain open to proposals from the credit union movement on this front and it does not appear that primary legislation is required in order to facilitate this.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-15a.157.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111500053#WRG00300"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr John Moran, attended the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform (JOC) on November 7th. During the course of the meeting, Mr Moran committed to writing to the JOC to give further detail on the issues raised by members of the Committee. One of these commitments related to providing an update of the Department&#8217;s progress in implementing recommendations put forward by the Wright Report. At the outset, it is worth noting that the Wright Report was related to the Department of Finance before a split of its functions was enacted. As you are aware 2011 was a year of significant change for my Department &#8211; the former Department of Finance was split into two Departments, the new Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As such, a number of the recommendations are the responsibility of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.     At the JOC, the Secretary General outlined the Department&#8217;s Statement of Strategy. The five major goals associated with the new Strategy are to deliver:</p><p>1. A resilient Irish economy founded on sustainable and balanced growth and leading to significant increases in employment numbers.</p><p>2. A sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances.</p><p>3. An improvement in the living standards of our citizens.</p><p>4. A return by Ireland to international debt markets so as to achieve an exit from the EU/IMF funding programme at the earliest possible date.</p><p>5. The completion of the restructuring of the banking system and a vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector.</p><p>  In light of the revised responsibilities and the new focus for the Department of Finance, the senior management team looked at the internal structures, reviewed how other Treasury Departments operate and sought to refine the organisational structures in order to position the Department correctly to achieve our ambitious goals. Many of the changes implemented go beyond the recommendations of the Wright Report. For example, the Management Advisory Council (MAC) has a new improved agenda. Rather than four similar meetings per month, now there is one in-depth meeting per month (more like a monthly board meeting) with three shorter focussed meetings on the week&#8217;s events.</p><p>  Also, four new subcommittees of the MAC, risk, policy, transformation, and people and culture allow for greater in-depth analysis than could occur during MAC meetings.   They are supplemented by staff working groups from within and outside the MAC to look at and make recommendations of what we might improve in areas such as internal communications or use of IT.</p><p>  I am hugely supportive of the work being done by senior management in my Department, and indeed staff at all levels. This work will ensure that the Department of Finance continues to develop in a way that further improves its ability to assist Government in implementing important policy initiatives.</p><p>  Please find in the annex an excerpt from the draft letter specifically related to the Wright Report that will be sent to the JOC in the coming days.</p><p>Wright Report on Strengthening the Capacity of the Department of Finance </p><p>Budgetary and Other Processes</p><p>1) After Cabinet review of Budget strategy in June, and consistent with its April submission to the European Commission, the Government should release for public and parliamentary review:</p><p>-the Department&#8217;s economic and fiscal forecast,</p><p>-the Department&#8217;s assessment of the economic and fiscal risks to this outlook,</p><p>-related sectoral analysis by the Department and</p><p>-the Government&#8217;s proposed quantum for fiscal action in new spending and tax expenditures.</p><p>  The Minister and the Department should consult widely on this framework, particularly with the relevant Oireachtas Committee.</p><p>  The Department is firmly committed to openness and transparency and an example of this is provided by the thorough level of engagement with committees such as the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  The Department of Finance currently produces three sets of published economic and fiscal forecasts every year:</p><p>1. at end-April for the Stability Programme Update (SPU);</p><p>2. in October/November for the Pre-Budget Outlook/Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, and</p><p>3. the annual Budget forecasts in December. </p><p>In addition White Paper (i.e. no policy change) fiscal forecasts for the Budget year are also prepared shortly in advance of the Budget. </p><p>  This is currently seen as an appropriate number of published forecasts. Publication of an additional set of forecasts just over 2 months after the publication of the SPU forecasts has not been deemed necessary in recent years. It is fair to say also that the published forecasts could be more evenly spread over the course of the year, for example in April, September and December. </p><p>  Of course the &#8220;2-pack&#8221; of draft EU regulations concerning budgetary frameworks will most likely mean the publication of draft budgetary plans, including economic and fiscal forecasts, by mid-October each year. The MTFS, which was released yesterday, and the draft budgetary plans that will be required under the &#8220;2-pack&#8221; is published at a stage in the budgetary process that greatly informs the public and political debate. This document outlines the Department&#8217;s latest view on the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook as well as the risks affecting this. It also provides aggregates for the fiscal stance that is considered as appropriate for the following Budget.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that following discussion of the 2011 Budget Strategy Memorandum (BSM) at Cabinet in July of last year, the Minister for Finance issued a statement in which he acknowledged discussion of the BSM &#8211; a <i>confidential</i>  , mid-year update of the emerging economic and budgetary outlook and an important part of the budgetary process &#8211; at Cabinet.</p><p>2) Departments would not seek spending enhancements beyond the spring consultations leading to the Budget review at Cabinet.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>3) To the extent that November tax results surprised to the upside, such revenue should be used for debt reduction, not new spending or tax relief.</p><p>  The Department of Finance agrees that fiscal policy should follow a sustainable path based on sound economic fundamentals. Broadly speaking, this recommendation advises that fiscal policy should be cognisant of underlying trends as opposed to one-off factors such as an upside surprise in November tax receipts.</p><p>  Under the terms that Ireland has negotiated with our funding partners in the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support, Ireland has committed that &#8220;Any additional unplanned revenues must be allocated to debt reduction&#8221; (Permanent Condition from the Memorandum of Understanding).</p><p>  Under the &#8220;six-pack&#8221;, which amended and strengthened the Stability and Growth Pact, Member States must make an appropriate annual improvement in their cyclically-adjusted budget balance, net of one-off and other temporary measures, towards their medium-term budgetary objective. Until Member States, including Ireland, reach their medium-term budgetary objective, annual expenditure growth (excluding expenditure relating to interest, co-funding for EU expenditure and non-discretionary changes in unemployment benefit expenditure) must not exceed a rate calculated on the basis of the medium-term rate of potential GDP growth. In addition, Ireland cannot make tax revenue reductions unless matched either by expenditure reductions or increases in other revenue items or both. </p><p>  As a result, as any upside revenue lodged to the Exchequer cannot be used for additional expenditure or additional tax relief, it will reduce the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement and, therefore, favourably impact on our debt situation.</p><p>4) The Panel supports the establishment of a Fiscal Council to review and publish commentary on the Department&#8217;s analysis and the Government&#8217;s proposed quantum for fiscal action. The Panel believes that such a Fiscal Council must be independent of Government, have qualified membership, a straight forward role and the ability to report in a timely manner. For example, following a June release of the Government&#8217;s fiscal plan, the Fiscal Council could review:</p><p>-the Department&#8217;s economic and fiscal outlook,</p><p>-the Department&#8217;s risk assessment,</p><p>-whether the proposed fiscal framework, including provision for new Government budgetary action, entails acceptable risks for the economy.</p><p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) was established on an administrative basis in June 2011, which in effect ensures compliance with Recommendation 4.  Upon passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill (FRB), it will put the IFAC on a statutory basis and assign it the monitoring and assessment functions required of an independent national institution under the Fiscal Compact. The FRB also provides for the funding of the IFAC. The provisions ensuring the independence of the IFAC comply with the European Commission&#8217;s Common Principles.</p><p>  The IFAC was established with a mandate to independently provide an assessment of, and to comment publicly on, whether the Government is meeting its own stated budgetary targets and objectives. The Council is also charged with assessing the appropriateness and soundness of the Government&#8217;s fiscal stance and official macroeconomic projections, as well as an assessment of the extent of compliance with the budgetary and debt rules.</p><p>5) To the extent the December Budget exceeds the quantum of action identified in June, the Fiscal Council should reassess the risks of these further actions for the economy.</p><p>Please refer to Recommendation 4.</p><p>6) The Fiscal Council could also usefully assess the impact of future Social Partnership wage and fiscal provisions on Ireland&#8217;s economic competitiveness.</p><p>Please refer to Recommendation 4.</p><p>Economic and Fiscal Forecasting</p><p>7) Forecasts in Budget Memoranda to Cabinet and for public consultations should include well-articulated scenarios of alternative outcomes, consistent with the Department&#8217;s risk analysis.</p><p>  Further to the information set out in respect of Recommendation 1, the Budget Strategy Memorandum (BSM), as well as other Departmental publications that provide economic and fiscal forecasts, sets out emerging risks, both positive and negative, to the emerging economic and fiscal outlook. Of course the risks to the economic outlook have implications for the public finances but there are also risks, separate to those associated with the general economic situation, which can have very serious consequences for the public finances. These too are identified in the BSM.</p><p>  Quantitative Sensitivity analysis of fiscal and economic outcomes analysis to changes in global growth and the savings rate (respectively) is conducted as part of on the Department&#8217;s forecasts and presented in the Medium Term Fiscal Statement (MTFS). A qualitative assessment of macroeconomic and fiscal risks is also set out.</p><p>  Details of engagement with economists and academics from the public and private sector that also assists in developing positions on risk analysis is provided in response to Recommendation 8.</p><p>8) In addition, the Department should provide a public work-shop, with private sector and academic interests, once a year so that the assessment of the economic and fiscal challenges can be debated before the Department finalises its forecasts.</p><p>  In terms of the fiscal situation, the Department, immediately after the end-June 2011 Exchequer Returns, held a briefing session to discuss the end-June numbers and prospects for the remainder of the year. Representatives from various banks/stock broking firms etc. were invited. Unfortunately representatives from just one institution attended. However we agree this should not discourage the Department from offering such briefings in the future and this is something we will look at again.</p><p>  Of course, the Department very regularly meets with and briefs, as part of its day-to-day operations, credit rating agencies, potential investors, international institutions.  In recent years the Department has considerably increased its level of interaction with economists from elsewhere in the public sector and in the private sector.  For example, the Economics Division has held a series of seminars over the past 18 months with private and public sector participation. Seminars have been held in the context of the Stability Programme Update in both 2011 and 2012 to discuss the macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts as well as the risks associated with those forecasts. A similar exercise was carried out in relation to last year&#8217;s Medium Term Fiscal Statement. A further seminar was held on estimation of the output gap and the structural balance in January of this year.</p><p>Advice over the Budget Cycle:</p><p>9) The Department of Finance should keep a written record of advice tendered and decisions taken as part of the budgetary process.</p><p>  Each year, as the Budget approaches many Pre-Budget Submissions are received by the Department primarily from individuals and from representative groups. Each Submission is recorded and filed. A copy is sent out to officials who are responsible for the relevant policy area. The Department also circulates these Submissions, as appropriate to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  A summary of the principal Submissions is also circulated as a Paper to members of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG). This Paper, along with the policy papers on Budget options which are also prepared by various Departments for the TSG, are subsequently published by the Department of Finance (further details of the TSG are at (16) below).</p><p>  Written submissions on various options are prepared for the Minister. The Minister will decide, in consultation with the relevant officials, whether or not a particular option should be pursued. These decisions are recorded in writing. Options which have been approved by the Minister are then included in the Budget and Finance Bill process which, of course, is subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.</p><p>10) The Panel strongly supports the public release of substantially more economic analysis by the Department. However, policy advice to the Minister for Finance in the preparation of the Government&#8217;s Budget should not be subject to release under Freedom of Information for at least five years.</p><p>  The recommendation that policy advice to the Minister for Finance in the preparation of the Government&#8217;s Budget should not be subject to release under Freedom of Information for at least five years has not been implemented.</p><p>  The reason why the recommendation has not been implemented is because it is not consistent with the Programme for Government which seeks to enhance openness, transparency and accountability of all public authorities.</p><p>Macro-economic Risks:</p><p>11) The Panel recommends that the Department prepare comprehensive macroeconomic risk assessment for Ireland as part of its annual advice to Cabinet.</p><p>  The Department has substantially increased the level of risk assessment it carries out in relation to its published forecasts as previously set out in Recommendations 1 and 7. A similar level of risk assessment is carried out in advising Cabinet.</p><p>  Cabinet is more informed than ever of economic developments and risks to the outlook. For example, the Economic Management Council, which consists of the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are given a weekly update of the latest economic developments. Detailed discussions of domestic and international risks occur at these weekly meetings which are supported by senior officials from the four Government Departments.</p><p>  Detailed quarterly commentaries on the macroeconomic situation and outlook are also provided by the documentation that accompanies the quarterly Troika missions. These are all available on the Department&#8217;s website.</p><p>12) The Department should establish sufficient formal arrangements with the Central Bank, including its Financial Regulation function, the NTMA and NAMA and establish sufficient technical capacity internally to manage this process.</p><p>  Senior officials from the Department of Finance, the NTMA, the Financial Regulator meet on a regular basis to discuss issues of strategic importance. The &#8216;Principal&#8217;s Group&#8217; consists of</p><p>- John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance</p><p>- Ann Nolan, Second Secretary General, Financial Services, Department of Finance</p><p>- John Corrigan, CEO, NTMA</p><p>- Patrick Honohan, Governor, Central Bank</p><p>- Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor, Financial Regulation, Central Bank</p><p>- Stefan Gerlach, Deputy Governor, Central Banking, Central Bank</p><p>  Other senior officials attend as required depending on the issues being discussed.</p><p>  On a more formal basis and in response to the internal and external recommendations on the General Government Debt consolidation discrepancy, the Department is formalising arrangements between the Department of Finance, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). The Department is in the final stages of a CBI Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), is well underway with a CSO MoU and plans to complete all MoUs by end-November.</p><p>  In relation to the NTMA, the Fiscal Division of the Department of Finance is in very regular contact and has a very good working relationship with counterparties in the NTMA on issues such as the Exchequer position, debt interest projections, funding issues etc. </p><p>  The Department meets quite regularly with the Agency in that context, most recently on Monday 12 November. The meetings tend to be more regular at particular points in the year &#8211; during the EU/IMF Programme review missions, the various forecasting rounds etc.  </p><p>  The department&#8217;s oversight of NAMA is now managed by the Shareholding Management Unit (SMU), which is staffed with banking specialists who are seconded from the NTMA&#8217;s banking division. This unit is responsible for ensuring the fulfilment of the Ministerial responsibilities under NAMA legislation to ensure NAMA meets its objectives and has regular interaction with senior executives of NAMA both on a formal and informal basis and meets Directors of the Agency on a frequent basis.</p><p>13) The Government should introduce legislation to establish a coordinating committee of these financial agencies, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, which would require the full exchange of any information that could entail fiscal or economic risks to the country, among the above agencies.</p><p>  As stated above in relation to Recommendation 12, stronger ties have been established between these financial agencies particularly through the &#8216;Principal&#8217;s Group&#8217; but no legislation has been introduced to cement the status of this group.</p><p>  In recent months, at an operational level the Department has also increased its engagement with other State departments and bodies on the identification and management of risk, including fiscal and economic risks. Although this engagement at this level is also not supported by a legislative mandate, it has resulted in an improvement in information sharing and risk management understanding and has also led to revisions in risk management practices at many of the Departments concerned.</p><p>Construction Policy:</p><p>14) The Department should include sectoral assessments in its annual economic analysis and forecast that is released for public consultation.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation primarily relates to the former Sectoral Policy Division of the Department which is now under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  However, the Department of Finance is clear that it has an important role to play in forming economic policy as well. The Department&#8217;s revised strategic plan, published in May of this year, announced that the Department is itself undergoing significant reforms. The five major goals associated with the new Strategy are to deliver:</p><p>1. A resilient Irish economy founded on sustainable and balanced growth and leading to significant increases in employment numbers.</p><p>2. A sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances.</p><p>3. An improvement in the living standards of our citizens.</p><p>4. A return by Ireland to international debt markets so as to achieve an exit from the EU/IMF funding programme at the earliest possible date.</p><p>5. The completion of the restructuring of the banking system and a vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector.</p><p>  As a key part of this reform programme, a new, expanded Economics Division has been established in the Department. This Division is resourced by expert economists in both the macroeconomic and microeconomic field with experience drawn from the private sector, international financial institutions and elsewhere in the public service. The Department&#8217;s economic resources have therefore been significantly increased and the Department is now conducting additional sectoral analysis as part of its economic planning and forecasting function.</p><p>Tax Policy Advice:</p><p>15) The Department should substantially increase its analytical capacity in the tax policy area.</p><p>  The Department has recently completed an open competition, under the auspices of the Public Appointments Service, for policy advisors who have been employed to work in the tax policy area. Six tax policy Graduate AOs have been recruited each of whom have a variety of tax, law and economic qualifications.</p><p>  Also, the Tax Policy Unit in the Department of Finance has over the past number of years progressively sought to increase its technical skills capacity. In this regard, the Tax Policy Unit has engaged, following a competitive tender process, with the Irish Taxation Institute to provide a certified tax policy training programme for its staff. This training programme, entitled the Diploma in Tax Policy and Practice, involves well over a 100 hours of tax technical training and runs over two years. The Diploma is being progressively rolled out to all staff in the Tax Policy Unit who do not already have specific tax qualifications.</p><p>  In addition, a number of staff in the Tax Policy Unit have completed or are currently undertaking professional tax qualifications (such as the AITI Chartered Tax Advisor qualification) and a number of short term secondments to external agencies (such as the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate for Taxation) to increase specialist knowledge have been organised.</p><p>  Separately, a specialist tax economic analysis unit has been established in the Tax Policy Unit staffed by externally recruited economists.</p><p>The Tax Policy Unit has also sought in recent years to increase its interaction with external stakeholders. One example of this is that a dedicated 'micro' website <i>www.taxpolicy.gov.ie</i>   has been established by the Tax Policy Unit in the Department of Finance to increase the availability of information on tax policy issues to the public. The website is the main portal now being used for an increasing number of public consultation processes on tax policy issues.</p><p>  In addition, the Tax Policy Unit has recently established a new Tax Training Network, membership of which is available to all staff in the Department of Finance and D/PER.</p><p>  The aim is to put in place a contact group of people across the Department who are interested in tax policy and would like to be kept informed of upcoming tax research seminars, tax conferences and training opportunities being run by or involving the Department of Finance&#8217;s Tax Policy Unit. </p><p>  To date, approximately 50 people across the two Departments have signed up for membership of the network.</p><p>  The organised events will qualify for CPD &#8211; continuing professional development &#8211; for the Irish Tax Institute and certain other accounting bodies. A growing number of staff in the Department have ITI tax qualifications.</p><p>16) The Department should organise itself to consult with tax and financial experts and prepare advice that is most appropriate to an efficient tax regime for Ireland.</p><p>  The Department of Finance has engaged with the Troika as part of the EU/IMF Programme and has already implemented many of the agreed policies in relation to tax policy.</p><p>Also, as part of the annual Budget process, the Tax Policy Unit chairs and provides the Secretariat for the Government&#8217;s Tax Strategy Group. The Tax Strategy Group considered 24 separate Tax Policy Papers prepared by the Tax Policy Unit in advance of Budget 2011, for example. These papers are published after each Budget and are available to read on the Department&#8217;s new dedicated Tax Policy website:   <i>www.taxpolicy.gov.ie</i></p><p>  In 2010-2011, a review of the Business Expansion Scheme was carried out and an Ex-Ante Economic Impact Assessment of the new Employment and Investment Incentive was published.</p><p>  A Study on the Economic and Budgetary Impact on the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in the European Union was commissioned by the Tax Policy Unit from Ernst and Young, Washington DC and was published in January 2011.</p><p>  The Tax Policy Unit assisted in the preparation of the National Recovery Plan 2011 &#8211; 2014, published in 2010.</p><p>  The Tax Policy Unit prepared a comprehensive review of tax expenditures in 2010 in line with the provision in Section 1 of Finance Act 2011.</p><p>  In 2011, the Tax Policy Unit published an Economic Impact Assessment of Potential Changes to Legacy Property Reliefs.</p><p>By using the Department&#8217;s new dedicated tax policy web portal, <i>www.taxpolicy.gov.ie</i>   , the Tax Policy Unit has in recent times been carrying out more and more public consultation processes as part of its deliberative process. Recent consultations include:</p><p>- legacy property reliefs;</p><p>- tax relief for charitable donations;</p><p>- tax residence rules;</p><p>- VRT and Motor Tax and </p><p>- Film Relief.</p><p>  Medium Term Analysis:</p><p>17) The Government should commit to the preparation of regular medium- term economic plans for Ireland at least every five years.</p><p>  The Department of Finance is broadly supportive of this recommendation. The negotiated EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support provides a template for economic planning. In it we have clear targets for our public finances, timetables to implement important strategic reforms and simultaneously have introduced a Jobs Action Plan, a stimulus package and radical reform of labour market activation measures. </p><p>  As part of the programme of reforms which the Department is undergoing, we plan to play a greater role in the management of our economy and to have a greater focus on strategic economic planning for the future. The Department is currently reviewing its economic planning function in order to best support the Government in the formulation of its short and medium-term economic strategy.</p><p>  Department&#8217;s Interface with Other Departments:</p><p>18) The Department should integrate those sections of Public Service Management and Development Division dealing with administrative budgets into Sectoral Policy Division to create a &#8220;single window&#8221; interface with line Departments.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>19) Activities could be organised immediately under the Assistant Secretary level in the Sectoral Policy Division. The longer-term objective should be to establish Principal positions responsible for the interface of all activities with outside Departments.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Public Service Management and Development:</p><p>20) Public Service Management and Development Division should be established as a separate entity, either as an entirely separate Department or reporting directly to the Minister of State for Public Service Modernisation.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>21) The Secretary General of the Department of Finance and Minister for Finance should retain authority over the overall wage bill, negotiating mandates for new collective bargaining processes and manage a single window on departmental control functions.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Public Service Modernisation:</p><p>22) The Panel strongly supports the creation of a Private Sector Advisory Board which it understands is under consideration by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance.</p><p>  I understand that in the context of the Wright report the Private Sector Advisory Board was recommended to assist in Public Service Modernisation particularly in relation to the Croke Park Agreement. While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>23) A full-time Task Force should be established and assigned responsibility for driving forward the reforms under the Croke Park Agreement.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>24) The Task Force would comprise existing staff from the Modernisation Unit of the Department. The Task Force would also include key individuals from the leading Departments along with expertise in the area of change management on secondment from the private sector.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>25) The Task Force&#8217;s Team leader should have direct access to the Minister of State responsible for Public Service Modernisation.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>26) In addition, there is a need to recruit expertise in the areas of change management and business process re-engineering.</p><p>  While the Department of Finance broadly supports this advice, following the split of the Department of Finance into two entities, this recommendation now falls under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Core Finance Functions:</p><p>27) With the possible exception of the Public Service Management and Development Division, no other core functions should be moved out of the Department of Finance.</p><p>  The Department of Finance split has been more substantial than this. Further details on the revised structure of the Department of Finance after the split is provided below in Recommendation 28.</p><p>Structure:</p><p>28) Assistant Secretaries should report directly to the Secretary General of Finance.</p><p>  Since the Wright Report was published in December 2010 there has been fundamental change to the structure of the Department with the split of the Department to DOF and DPER in July 2011. On the 10th May 2012 the Department under the leadership of a new Secretary General published the 2012 revision of the Departments Statement of Strategy 2011 &#8211; 2014. The statement sets out the revised organisational structure of the Department. This structure is based on four key policy divisions &#8211; EU and International, Financial Services Division, Fiscal Policy Division and Economic Division &#8211; and the establishment of a Corporate Office, and a Finance Office.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-11-15a.163.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111500053#WRG00700"><p>There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no such single internationally agreed methodology to calculate the effective rate of corporation tax, there is no basis upon which to calculate the current &lsquo;effective rate&rsquo; of corporate tax in Ireland without being potentially misleading.  Therefore, neither I, nor my Department, would be in a position to introduce an &lsquo;effective rate&rsquo; in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.</p><p>  Regarding the headline corporate tax rate, the Taoiseach, myself and other members of the Government have repeatedly expressed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the retention of the 12.5% rate.  In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average.  On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%. This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland.</p><p>  The major importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position in the current climate must also be borne in mind.  Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here.  Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. </p><p>  Further, it would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s stated position that we will not change our corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p></reply>

It has been evolving since the attempted coup in March and the <i>de facto</i> secession of much of the north of the country.  The UN Security Council has adopted two Resolutions, the latest of which, on 12 October, increases the pressure on the parties in Mali to agree a political &#8216;roadmap&#8217; for a return to democratic governance.  The Resolution also endorses planning for the possible deployment of a military force by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to support the Malian authorities to regain territorial control in the north.     At the meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg on 15 October, we adopted comprehensive Conclusions reaffirming the EU&#8217;s commitment to continuing to play a constructive role in support of stabilisation efforts.  The EU is working through political pressure, development and economic assistance and, when appropriate, in support for a regional military intervention and a possible Common Security and Defence Policy mission focused on training of the Malian Armed Forces.  The European Council subsequently endorsed these Council Conclusions and expressed its serious concern over the continuing political, security and humanitarian crisis in Mali.  EU Foreign and Defence Ministers are to continue the EU discussions on Mali when they meet in Brussels on 19 November.</p><p>  A meeting involving the local Malian parties, ECOWAS, the African Union and the EU took place in Bamako on 19 October. The EU, UN and others stressed the importance of early agreement on a &#8216;roadmap&#8217; for the transition to democratic governance and of Malian commitment to reforming the military.  Once the &#8216;roadmap&#8217; is agreed, it is anticipated that a third UN Security Council Resolution will be drafted authorising the deployment of an ECOWAS military intervention.  The adoption of such a &#8216;roadmap&#8217; would also enable the EU to resume suspended bilateral development cooperation and then to consider financial and other supports for the ECOWAS force and the possible deployment of an EU mission.     </p><p>  Complex crises such as this highlight the need for the EU and Member States to work together  coherently and collectively, using all of the instruments available, to pursue a comprehensive approach with our international partners in the region, including ECOWAS, the African Union and the United Nations.  </p></reply>

Over 165 written submissions were received.   The exercise also involved consultation across Government Departments and in the Houses of the Oireachtas, including through the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.

The Universal Social Charge (USC) is an individualised charge and as such the yield is calculated for individual incomes of more than &euro;100,000.   On that basis I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, would be &euro;321 million. The estimated yield is based on confining the 5 percentage point increase to the portion of income which is in excess of &euro;100,000, that is, the increase is not applied to the portion of total income earned up to &euro;100,000.</p><p>  The figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2010 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

Pensions are generally taken to be deferred income and any action to reduce a pension in payment needs to be comprehensively founded lest it run the risk of being considered an unjust attack by the State on the property rights of individuals affected by the proposed legislation.  The Government will seek to explore any avenues and options to address this issue subject to the necessary legal constraints.</p></reply>

During this period, the IFSC has grown to employ 33,000 people and to contribute over &#8364;1 billion annually through corporation tax and payroll taxes. </p><p>  These groups provide a forum in which the public sector can consult with industry representatives to discuss competitive threats facing the industry, and develop strategies for the industry to pro-actively support its own development in the global economy.</p><p>  Representatives of my Department are available to meet with, and do meet with on a regular basis, representatives from many industry and civil society groups who are willing to engage in discussions on the difficult choices which need to be made in the current economic climate.</p><p>  The Clearing House Group has five sub-groups, and meetings in the year 2012 have been as follows:</p><p><i>Clearing House Group:</i>-</p><p>- The Clearing House Group has met on four occasions in 2012 to date.  The Department of Finance was represented at all meetings, and representatives have included:-</p><p>- Second Secretary, Financial Services Division;</p><p>- One Principal Officer, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>- One Principal Officer, Financial Services Division;</p><p>  Representatives from Revenue and the Central Bank also attended all of these meetings.</p><p><i>Asset Management Group:-</i></p><p>- The Asset Management group has met on three occasions in 2012 to date.  The Department of Finance was not represented at any of these meetings.  Representatives from the Revenue Commissioners attended one of these meetings, and representatives from the Central Bank attended all three of these meetings.</p><p><i>Banking and Treasury Group:-</i></p><p>- The Banking &amp; Treasury Group has met on six occasions in 2012 to date.  The Department of Finance was represented at all meetings, and representatives have included:-</p><p>- One Assistant Secretary, Financial Services Division;</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Financial Services Division;</p><p>- Two Administrative Officers, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>  Representatives of the Revenue Commissioners attended all of these meetings.  Representatives from the Central Bank did not attend these meetings.</p><p><i>Funds Group:-</i></p><p>- The Funds Group has met on nine occasions in 2012 to date.</p><p>- The Department of Finance was represented on all meetings, and representatives have included:-</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Financial Services Division;</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Banking Division;</p><p>- One Administrative Officer, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>- One Administrative Officer, Financial Services Division.</p><p>  Representatives from the Revenue Commissioners have attended three of these meetings, and representatives from the Central Bank attended all nine of these meetings.</p><p><i>Insurance Group:-</i></p><p>  The Insurance Group has met on 6 occasions in 2012 to date.</p><p>  The Department of Finance was represented at all meetings, and representatives have included:-</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>- One Assistant Principal, Financial Services Division;</p><p>- One Administrative Officer, Fiscal Policy Division;</p><p>  Representatives from the Central Bank attended all of these meetings.

A Report on the work of the Group during this period will also be published on the websites.  Additionally, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and Chair of the Clearing House Group is to write to the Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service offering to brief them on the work of the Clearing House Group.</p><p>  While we accept the bona fides of the Deputy&#8217;s request for briefing notes or reports prepared by officials before and after these meetings, it is not practical to provide the information that the Deputy is seeking in the time available to formulate a reply to a parliamentary question.  Accordingly, I suggest that following the publication of the material referred to in the previous paragraph, and the proposed briefing, the Deputy may wish to contact the individual Departments and Offices indicating what further detail he requires.</p></reply>

This information would be essential to determine whether a charge to USC applied or not at individual level, and at what rate if it did.  It is possible in many cases that the rate could be low or even nil.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, a number of social protection payments would be below the current exemption threshold for USC which is currently &euro;10,036 per annum.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as they do not maintain such a database of social protection payments there is no basis on which an estimate of the yield from the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. </p><p>  By way of illustration, if for example a 1 per cent levy was imposed on social protection payments, the full year yield to the Exchequer would be &euro;180 million on the basis that the estimated provision for such payments in 2012, excluding child benefit, is approximately &euro;18 billion.  The figure of &euro;18 billion excludes administration and other administration expenses but may include certain non-departmental operational costs.  The estimate of Exchequer yield assumes that there is no exemption threshold, allowance or personal reliefs that could be used to offset against some of the levy.</p></reply>

The primary focus of the group is to identify and consider issues of importance to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland in line with the Programme for Government which states that the Government &#8220;<i>supports the future development of the IFSC as a source of future employment growth, subject to appropriate regulation</i>  &#8221; and commits to the development of the financial services sector to maximise employment opportunities.</p><p>  Since the inception of the IFSC, close cooperation between industry and the public sector has been a foundation of its success.

The Central Bank is satisfied that it conducts its regulatory and supervisory functions in an independent manner.</p><p>The IFSC strategy, which the Clearing House Group is tasked with implementation, sets out the very clear policy that &#8220;<i>our future as an international financial services industry centre depends on having a credible, responsible and proper regulatory regime,</i>&#8221; and a regime &#8220;<i>that has the capacity to deal with the most complex international institutions and the increasing volume of EU and international requirements</i>  .&#8221;</p></reply>

However, please see below the comments from President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, when asked about the matter at the ECB press conference following the Governing Council meeting on 8 November;   &ldquo;Let me first make a clarification, because there has been a lot of press on this point in the last week.  The first clarification is purely factual: the nominal amount of collateral being posted was not EUR 80 billion, but EUR 10 billion.  The second clarification is that all this had no impact at all on our lending.  So nobody received more than they should have received because of this mistake &ndash; because it was a mistake.  The impact of this is zero, but we take this mistake very seriously.  And so the Governing Council has mandated the Eurosystem Audit Committee, which is chaired by Governor Liikanen, to assess the implementation of the collateral framework in the Eurosystem and we will have an initial assessment of this at our next Governing Council meeting and then we will discuss whether further analysis or further action is needed and I will keep you posted on that.&rdquo;</p></reply>

Further, Member States have committed themselves to undertake measures necessary to correct harmful imbalances.  In a consultative process, typically a co-ordinated and unified approach emerges naturally and extends to economic and fiscal issues.  This is also in the interest of even-handedness.  While I cannot speak for each and every Member State, the need and desire to protect the common EU and euro area good is felt generally.  This includes reducing fiscal deficits and consolidating debt with an aim to reducing the high interest rates resulting from high levels of indebtedness.  Since the onset of the financial crisis and the subsequent entry of Greece, Ireland and Portugal into Programmes of Financial Assistance, the EU and the eurozone have taken measures to reduce the cost of programme funding. </p><p>  The interest rates on EU funding mechanisms (the EFSF and EFSM) were reduced significantly in 2011 and are now provided at rates close to the cost of funding.  These rates apply equally to all countries availing of these mechanisms.  The maturities of these loans were extended at the same time.  For example, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government agreed on 21 July 2011 to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to interest rates equivalent to those of the EU Balance of Payments facility i.e. close to, without going below, the EFSF's cost of funding.  Lengthening of maturities provides benefits in terms of phasing of loans and ensuring that the profile of redemptions is more orderly, avoiding as far as possible exceptionally large amounts in particular years.  By contrast, money borrowed at longer maturities is generally more expensive.  However, on balance, savings arising from maturity extension are significant though complex to calculate.  The interest rate reductions for the EFSF and the EFSM have also been reflected in the rates charged on Ireland's bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.</p><p>  As noted above, our EU programme funding is being provided at, or close to, the cost of funds for the lenders.  The scope for further changes to our programme interest payments is therefore very limited.  However, we are also seeking ways to alleviate the burden on the sovereign of assisting the banking sector.  Arising out of the 29 June 2012 statement by the Euro Area Heads of State or Government that &quot;it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&quot;, work is continuing at a technical level to put in place the single supervisory mechanism and the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s direct banking recapitalisation facility at the earliest possible date.  In short, every effort has been and is being made at EU and eurozone level to ensure the burden placed on Programme countries is reduced in order to support the success of their programmes.</p></reply>

Excise duty, capital acquisitions tax and customs duty are behind profile.  The supplementary information contains a table which shows the exact performance of each tax head, both compared to profile and as a year on year basis, and on both a monthly and cumulative basis.  It is encouraging that three of the big four tax sources of revenue are ahead of expectations at end-October. As outlined in the medium-term fiscal statement published yesterday, the Department of Finance is of the view that tax revenues for the year as a whole will be broadly in line with profile, with the possibility of a marginal surplus, of the order of &euro;0.2 billion (0.5%) being recorded.  Much will depend on the performance of tax revenues in November.  It is the most important month of the year for income tax and corporation tax and it is also the last VAT &ldquo;due&rdquo; month of the year.  All told, close to &euro;5.7 billion or 16% of the total tax expected this year is profiled for collection in the month.  Good performances are required from each of these three taxes if the annual aggregate target for taxes is to be achieved.  As regards 2013, we expect that the minor 2012 tax revenue surplus will have beneficial impacts for the base going into next year which will largely offset the negative impact of weaker economic growth.</p></reply>

However, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the following existing incentives in the tax code to encourage individuals to invest in schemes which can lead to job creation:</p><p>The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII)</p><p>The EII is a tax incentive that provides tax relief for investors who purchase new ordinary shares in small and certain medium-sized companies carrying on a trade, and who hold those shares for a minimum of three years.  The incentive is designed to help companies to raise new risk capital to expand their activities.  An individual investor can obtain income tax relief on investments up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum, subject to the high income individuals restriction, in each tax year up to 2013.  The maximum amount that may be raised by a company in any 12-month period is &euro;2.5 million, subject to a lifetime limit of &euro;10 million.  The maximum rate of tax relief available to an individual who subscribes for new ordinary shares is 30% of the amount invested. A further 11% tax relief may be available at the end of the holding period, however, provided the company concerned has either increased its number of employees or spent at least 30% of the investment raised on research and development.</p><p>The Seed Capital Scheme (SCS)</p><p>The SCS provides that an employee, who leaves employment and invests by means of shares in a qualifying new venture, may claim a refund of income tax paid in previous years.  An unemployed person may also avail of this facility.  The maximum investment that can be set against taxable income in any year of assessment is &euro;100,000.  This means that the maximum total investment that can be made under the Seed Capital Scheme is &euro;600,000, as the individual may set up to &euro;100,000 against the taxable income of each of the previous six years.  By way of example, an individual who invests &euro;10,000 under the scheme would be entitled to a refund of income tax already paid of &euro;4,100 provided they had paid income tax at the higher rate in the relevant tax year.</p><p>Film Relief (Section 481)</p><p>The film relief scheme was introduced to promote the Irish film industry, by encouraging investment in Irish made films.  Tax relief on the full amount of the investment is available to individual investors at their marginal rate of tax (41% for top rate taxpayers).  Individual investors can invest up to &euro;50,000 under the scheme in any year of assessment.  The maximum amount which can be raised by a film production company, under the scheme is 80% of the total cost per production, subject to a maximum of &euro;50,000,000.</p></reply>

While the pass-through of the increase in global energy prices is driving headline figures, I would point out that core or underlying inflation remains very contained.   Following on the fall in consumer prices in 2009 and 2010, the moderate rate of inflation that we have seen over the last two years or so is assisting us in regaining our price competitiveness, and helping the exporting sector to grow. Ireland&rsquo;s HICP inflation rate has now been below or equal to the euro area average for every month since March 2008.</p></reply>

The shift in the composition of activity &ndash; away from domestic demand and into the exporting sectors &ndash; that has characterised developments in recent years is continuing.   Support for overall activity is coming from the exporting sectors, with services exports becoming an increasingly important engine of growth in recent quarters. The most recent figures show a year-on-year increase in services exports of 9.0 per cent in Q2. This, in no small part, reflects the improvements in price and cost competitiveness that have been evident since the onset of the crisis.  </p><p>  Domestic demand, on the other hand, remains weak. Households, firms and the government sector are still working through the imbalances built up during the boom. Available high-frequency indicators point to a continuation of the divergence between domestic and export-facing sectors well into this year. A return to sustainable growth will require these imbalances to be worked through. In particular, we will need to restore order to the public finances. </p><p>  We will also need further improvements in our competitiveness and a banking sector capable of supporting real economic activity. These are the areas in which government policy is focused.</p><p>  The ongoing rebalancing of activity continues to have adverse implications for the labour market, given that the employment content of export-led activity is typically lower than that for activity driven by domestic demand. Employment has continued to fall in the first half of the year, with job losses being recorded in a majority of sectors.  Notwithstanding this, unemployment has shown some tentative signs of stabilisation over the course of the year, albeit at a level that is too high (14.8 per cent).</p><p>  The emerging picture is one of modest growth in the second half of this year, with a positive contribution from net trade offsetting further weakness in domestic demand.</p></reply>

This reflects both households' efforts to reduce their high indebtedness built up during the boom years as well as precautionary motives due to the challenging economic environment. In terms of the percentage share of household financial assets, there has been little change in how they are held. The main difference between Q2 2008 and Q2 2012 is a slight decrease in the percentage of assets held in shares and other equities, with the share of deposits increasing marginally.   A number of incentives are available to those who wish to invest in job creation, including the Employment Investment Incentive (EII), a tax relief incentive scheme which provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades. Relief is initially available to an individual at 30%, with a further 11% tax relief available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the holding period.</p><p>  The film relief scheme was also introduced, which aims to promote the domestic film industry, by encouraging investment in Irish made films. Tax relief on the full amount of the investment is available to individual investors at their marginal rate of tax (41% for top rate taxpayers) and individual investors can invest up to 50,000 euro under the scheme in any year of assessment	.</p></reply>

This, in no small part, reflects the improvements in price and cost competitiveness that have been evident since the onset of the crisis. Such internal price adjustments are crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s recovery, given that Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the euro area eliminates the option of currency devaluation.   The European Commission recently forecast that our nominal unit labour costs will have fallen by a cumulative 16 percentage points in the period 2009-2014 compared with an increase of 8 percentage points for the euro area as a whole. Furthermore, from a macro-economic perspective an important measure of competitiveness is the real harmonised competitiveness indicator (HCI). This reflects relative consumer prices trends, together with weighted exchange rates. Since mid-2008, the real HCI has fallen by 21 percentage points, indicating an improvement in our international competitiveness. </p><p>  So many of the necessary improvements are taking place, and this will support economic growth into the future.</p></reply>

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.</p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;.  Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching.  The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.  These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions.  The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.</p></reply>

The Business Intelligence tool acquired has the capacity to merge information from many different data stores and provides users with interactive dashboards, analysis and reporting functionality, and capacity to run ad-hoc queries.  This tool has been implemented for designated staff in the Inspectorate, Statistics Section and Post-Primary Division of my Department, using primary census returns data and aggregate post-primary pupil data.

The general position adopted by my Department in reviewing the business case of an allowance, as stated during the Review conducted this year is that allowances should only be payable in certain circumstances.  These are:</p><p>- that it reflects the arduous nature or unsocial hours, including the need to remain on call at weekends and other times, clearly associated with the duties of posts, or</p><p>- work of additional value is actually received by an employer, or</p><p>- an actual cost accrues to the employee derived from their employment.</p><p>  In that context, my Department has sanctioned new pay allowances since June 2010, including:</p><p> - An on-call allowance (&euro;1,188 per week) for clinical staff at the National Virus Reference Laboratory at UCD, paid to one staff member per week to be on-call on a 24/7 basis for that week.</p><p>- An on-call allowance (&euro;5,940 per annum) for 6 staff members in the National Ambulance Service, following the recommendation of a HIQA report that the HSE should ensure that there are formalised senior manager on call arrangements in place at all times for ambulance services, including Ambulance Control.</p><p>- An out of hours allowance was approved for Forensic Psychiatrists in order to ensure the availability of Consultant Psychiatric Support in critical emergency incidents, particularly in the context of recommendations arising from reviews of the tragic events at Abbeylara.</p><p>  The detailed information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of new beneficiaries of allowances in the wider public service in that period is not available to my Department.  My Department has however published extensive information on the numbers in receipt of allowances during 2011.  This does not include staff of commercial State -sponsored bodies or bodies funded by the State outside the public service since the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  is not responsible for setting the rate of pay for employees (other than the Chief Executives of the commercial semi-State bodies) outside the public service.</p></reply>

As these groups fall within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, decisions about publishing their records are in the first instance a matter for that Department. The Taoiseach this week informed this House that the minutes of Clearing House Group meetings and certain reports will in future be published both on his Department&rsquo;s website and on www.merrionstreet.ie.  He also stated that he had arranged to have the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform briefed on the work of the Groups.</p><p>  In terms of the involvement of my officials with the IFSC groups, the Secretary General of my Department is the Department&rsquo;s representative on the high level IFSC Clearing House Group and has attended 3 of the 5 meetings held so far this year.  The Assistant Secretary with responsibility for the Innovation and Investment Division deputised for him at one meeting and an Assistant Principal Officer from the Company Law Unit of the Department deputised at the other. In addition, the Company Law Unit of my Department is represented, at either Principal Officer or Assistant Principal Officer level, on both the IFSC Funds Group and that group&rsquo;s Legislative Sub-Group.  To date in 2012, these two groups met 8 and 5 times respectively and my Department was represented at all but 2 of these meetings.</p><p>  It is not normal practice for my Department to produce reports for the Clearing House Group, though it does provide input to periodic progress reports, coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach, on implementing the IFSC Statement of Strategy.  </p><p>  Representation on the Funds and Funds Legislation Sub-Groups provides my officials with the opportunity to update and consult representatives of the collective investment funds industry about the practical implications on that sector of any relevant new EU company law proposals. My Department does not prepare briefing documents specifically for the IFSC groups on these proposals but instead draws the attention of members to public consultation documents or to proposals published either on this Department&rsquo;s or on the EU Commission&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  During 2012 the Funds and Funds Legislative Sub-Groups were invited in this way to comment on EU proposals to amend the accounting and auditing directives. In addition, the Funds Legislative Sub-Group was consulted on the Companies Bill, which I intend to publish by the end of this year.  </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. </p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  </p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports. </p></reply>

The main payments in this regard include child benefit and the family income supplement as well as qualified child increases to primary social welfare payments. Therefore, in responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I propose to concentrate on these three payments in particular.</p><p>  Child benefit is a universal payment made in respect of the care of children.  The well-being of the children is the priority consideration in the operation of the current child benefit arrangements and this is reflected in the fact that payment is normally given to a person with whom the child is normally resident rather than on the basis of formal custody arrangements.   Reflecting changes to the payment and its precursor (the children&rsquo;s allowance payment) in the 1970s and 1980s, social welfare legislation provides that the payment is normally made to the mother or step-mother of the qualified child payment where the child lives with both parents. Similarly, where the child lives with their father but not their mother, payment may be made to the father. The scheme does not provide for the splitting of the payment between parties in joint custody cases but is based on where the child is normally resident.</p><p>  The family income supplement scheme (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families and is designed to preserve the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. In the case of parents who are separated, a parent who is wholly or mainly maintaining a former spouse and child(ren) can qualify for FIS.  However, only one FIS payment can be made in respect of any family. Furthermore, a person included in one particular family for any period for FIS purposes shall not be regarded as a member of any other family during that period. Current provisions do not therefore allow for FIS payments to be divided between parents. Where a question arises in determining the residence of a child for FIS purposes, an investigation of specific circumstances may be carried out. </p><p>  Qualified child increases (QCIs) are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefit and assistance payments to reflect the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children. Therefore, QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance. To qualify for payment of a QCI, the child in respect of whom the increase is claimed must considered to be normally resident with the person who is claiming the primary payment. In cases where the parents of a child are living apart, the child is considered normally resident with whom s/he is living. Where the child is resident part of the time with each parent, the child is considered to be normally resident with the parent with whom the child resides most of the time. </p><p>  If the Deputy wishes to have a particular payment or case considered in further detail or to query the specific payment arrangements around a particular scheme, he can arrange to have the details brought to the attention of my Department for consideration.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects schemes through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The Government has provided &euro;35 million for the school meals programme in 2012.</p><p>Funding under the school meals local projects scheme is for food costs only, subject to certain conditions.  All food must be of suitable quality and nutritional value, and prepared and consumed in an appropriate environment.   The type and range of meals provided, as well as the method and logistics of supplying the meals, are decided by the individual local groups and schools that operate the projects. Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school/group.</p><p>Schools may apply for funding for all pupils, if they feel such a need exists.  There is no automatic entitlement to funding and all applications must be considered in light of the available budget for the scheme.  Priority for funding is currently given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skill&rsquo;s initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS).  All DEIS schools who applied to join the scheme in the previous school year have been invited to participate in the 2012/2013 school meals programme. Over forty additional DEIS schools have joined the scheme during the past four years.</p><p>Payment under the scheme, which is paid in two instalments, is based on a rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided. Details of the various options available under the scheme and rates of payment per child are shown in the tabular statement.</p><p><b>Various food options and payment per child:</b></p><p><table><tr><th> Breakfast/Snack</th><th> &#8364;0.60</th><th> Cereal, Toast, Scone, Fruit, Yogurt, Milk, Juice-2 Items must be provided</th></tr><tr><td> Lunch</td><td> &#8364;1.40</td><td> Filled Sandwich/Roll or Soup &amp; Roll or Salad Plate, plus 2 other items (eg Milk, Juice, Fruit, Yogurt)</td></tr><tr><td> Dinner</td><td> &#8364;1.90</td><td>Meat, Potatoes &amp; Vegetables or Chicken Curry or Spaghetti Bolognaise, plus a drink (Milk, Juice, Water)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.  In 2012, the Arts Council received an allocation of over &#8364;63 million &#8211; a curbing of the budgetary decline of previous years.</p><p>  The Government appreciates the importance of the arts, culture and the creative industries to both our society and to our economy.

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.</p><p>I am informed by the SEAI that when the house in question was surveyed it was identified that the walls were already fully insulated but that it had insufficient attic insulation.  The home in question is a dormer bungalow and the practice of insulating dormer roofs through the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was recently reviewed in respect of value for money, the overall effectiveness of the additional insulation which can only be undertaken in part of the roof space, and the significant costs associated with achieving appropriate ventilation in the roof space to avoid condensation problems.  All of this is in the context of endeavouring to address the maximum number of vulnerable fuel poor homes from within available resources.  On balance it has been decided that the significant costs are not generally justified by the marginal insulation gains.  Therefore insulation of dormer roofs is not currently implemented under the scheme.  However, I am advised that SEAI will continue to keep the matter under review with my officials for feasible cost effective alternatives, particularly where the homes are in extreme fuel poverty, at which time affected houses may be revisited.  </p></reply>

In the case of roaming charges, ComReg&rsquo;s market regulation is also exercised in accordance with applicable provisions of EU Roaming Regulations.</p><p>The current EU Roaming Regulation &ldquo;(EU) No 531/2012 of 13 June 2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks&rdquo;, which commenced on 1st July last, is the third in a series of such EU Regulations, first introduced in 2007.  The purpose of these EU Regulations is to provide increasing levels of consumer protection to customers in all EU member states when using mobile roaming services.  The reductions in the maximum permitted retail prices for roaming services within the EU required by these Regulations are summarised in the following table (excluding VAT).  The Regulations impose binding maximum permitted retail prices but service providers are free to charge lower prices.</p><p><table><tr><th><div>Maximum price</div></th><th><div>Making a call/minute</div></th><th><div>Receiving a call/minute</div></th><th><div>Sending an SMS</div></th><th><div>Receiving an SMS</div></th><th><div>Mobile Internet</div></th></tr><tr><td>July 2009</td><td><div>43 cents</div></td><td><div>19 cents</div></td><td><div>11 cents</div></td><td><div>free</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>July 2010</td><td><div>39 cents</div></td><td><div>15 cents</div></td><td><div>11 cents</div></td><td><div>free</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>July 2011</td><td><div>35 cents</div></td><td><div>11 cents</div></td><td><div>11 cents</div></td><td><div>free</div></td><td><div>-</div></td></tr><tr><td>July 2012</td><td><div>29 cents</div></td><td><div>8 cents</div></td><td><div>9 cents</div></td><td><div>free</div></td><td><div>70 cents/MB</div></td></tr></table></p><p>The current EU Roaming Regulation also obliges mobile service providers to inform customers of roaming charges and to implement a minimum set of customer protection measures  which include the following.</p><p>(i) Service provider must advise customers by SMS, on each occasion a customer moves to a roaming service, of the costs of roaming in the EU, including the cost of calls made and received, the cost of sending an SMS/MMS, the cost per Megabyte (MB) of data and provide a freephone number to customers to deal with any additional customer queries.</p><p>(ii) In the case of customers who data roam, service providers must automatically impose a data cap of &euro;50 (excluding VAT) in any month in which a customer roams.  Customers must be advised when 80% of the data usage cap is reached and at 100% of the data usage cap the service should cease.  Customers can then choose to continue to data roam incurring additional charges above the default cap if they wish.  The data cap requirement is mandatory within the EU.  In the case of customers roaming outside the EU, the data usage alert is required where possible.  If the visited network outside the EU area cannot provide a warning alert, the customer should receive an SMS advising that the operator cannot apply the data usage alert in that country.</p><p>Any customer  who has been charged  in excess  of the permitted roaming rates or who has incurred significant roaming charges without receiving the customer information required by the EU Regulation should contact ComReg to pursue the matter further.  ComReg can be contacted at <i>consumerline@comreg.ie</i>, by phone at (01) 804 9668 or 1890 229668 or at Block DEF, Abbey Court, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.</p></reply>

A public consultation on the proposed plan was commenced by the Agency on 11 October 2012.  Submissions received are currently being reviewed by the Agency with a view to finalising the Plan.  A training course for persons who will be appointed to carry out inspections is also currently being finalised and this is being overseen by the Water Services Training Group.  I understand that the Plan and the training course will be finalised shortly.   </p><p>  The standards to be met by all domestic waste water treatment systems are set out in the Act.  They are that such systems do not constitute and are not likely to constitute a risk to human health or the environment and in particular do not create a risk to water, air or soil or to plants or animals.  The Act also provides that such systems must not create a nuisance through noise or odours or adversely affect the countryside or places of special interest.  These standards were augmented by the provisions of the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012 (Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems) Regulations 2012 which set out additional performance standards, including maintenance and de-sludging requirements.          </p><p>  A Regulatory Impact Analysis carried out by my Department for the 2012 Act is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The 2007 Regulatory Impact Analysis referred to was prepared by consultants, ERM Ireland, for the Environmental Protection Agency and it was not concerned with the provisions of the 2012 Act. </p><p>  It is not possible to estimate the total cost of remediation for defective domestic waste water treatment systems.  The extent of remediation required will depend on the nature of any problem identified, the extent of the risk to human health or the environment and the hydrological and geological conditions present.  These factors will inform the selection of the most appropriate and cost-effective solution.  While responsibility for the maintenance of on-site waste water treatment systems lies with the owners of those systems, I have stated on a number of occasions that I am prepared to consider all possible options to provide financial support to householders&rsquo; whose wastewater treatment systems are deemed, following inspection under the new legislation, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  The provision of any financial support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of the individual households concerned.     </p></reply>

While the main purpose the Bill is to provide for the introduction of attachment of earnings to collect unpaid fines, the Bill will also amend section 15 of the Fines Act 2010 to provide an automatic right to pay by instalments to all persons on whom a fine is imposed.  Under the 2010 Act, in order to avail of the payment by instalment provisions, the person had to satisfy the court that to require him or her to pay the fine in full by the due date would cause undue financial hardship.  I hope that it will be possible to enact the Fines (Amendment) Bill during 2013.</p></reply>

Furthermore, a Garda unit has been  specifically tasked with dealing with public order incidents, deploying a public order van on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. The work of this unit is supplemented  by other units working ordinarily in the Temple Bar area.  I am also informed that the deployment of plain-clothes officers in Temple Bar has led to significant successes in tackling drug related issues. </p><p>  The Garda authorities also continue to employ a collaborative approach in addressing anti-social behaviour issues in the area which includes important ongoing liaison with local business associations, such as the Temple Bar Traders Association and other stakeholders.  This approach is designed to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is kept fully informed of criminal matters of concern to the local business community, to ensure that appropriate crime prevention advice is provided and to facilitate a joint approach to policing the night-time economy in the area.</p><p>  This situation is being kept under ongoing review and I can further assure the Deputy that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner with a view to ensuring that our streets are safe for all.</p></reply>

The first finding of the disease was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  </p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent have now been superseded by robust legislation. This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea.</i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country is now also subject to plant passport requirements. Additional legislation was also introduced which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. </p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection. These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent. Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.</p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots. Boots should then be sprayed with disinfectant and used water should be disposed of onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse. In relation to clothing it is recommended to check all clothing and remove any plant material.  Soil and plant debris should be washed off all tools and equipment with disinfectant.</p><p>  Forest owners, forest nursery staff and members of the public have been asked by my Department to be vigilant for the disease and report (with photographs if possible), any sites where there are concerns about unusual ill health in ash trees to the Forest Service. </p></reply>

The profile which is the best estimate of expenditure available at the time is difficult to forecast and may vary significantly during the year for a variety of reasons, such as the level of payments under demand led schemes, the pattern of drawdown of Grants-in-Aid by State bodies, the levels of disease incident and payment of compensation, etc.. A monthly comparison is reported showing actual expenditure against the profile.</p><p>  The recent Exchequer returns for my Department and show that the there are a number of budget lines, which are, for a variety of reasons, behind profile. I expect that in most cases expenditure will &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; before the end of the year. Expenditure is being monitored and managed carefully with a view to minimising savings on this year&rsquo;s Vote. The final outcome is to a large extent driven by factors outside the Department&rsquo;s control but in the overall context of the Department&rsquo;s Vote of &euro;1.339billion, I do not expect a significant underspend this year. </p></reply>

Under this legislation, my Department fulfils an important ongoing role in the private health insurance market, by ensuring that the market is regulated appropriately and that access to health insurance cover is available to consumers of health services with no differentiation made between them. </p><p>  The maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market by my Department is essential to facilitate the transition to a market-based Universal Health Insurance (UHI) system.  In addition, there are a number of important stepping stones to achieving the Programme for Government commitment of UHI, one of which is the introduction of a robust risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market.</p><p>  The introduction of a permanent scheme of risk equalisation is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market. I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012 on 18 October, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013.  Second Stage of this Bill is currently underway in the D&aacute;il and is expected to conclude today, 15th November.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.</p><p>  There can be little doubt that price increases will make it more difficult for persons who hold private health insurance to renew their policies. I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers. I will continue to focus strongly on this issue. </p><p>  I am keen to explore all available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance.  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum has been established with a view to generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. Its core focus is on identifying ways of addressing costs throughout the industry, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model. I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  </p><p>  In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out an external review of their claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches. </p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

Drivers are employed by co-operatives to drive GPs when making house calls.  The driver provision addresses issues of security and location knowledge for GPs.  In many cases, the cost of providing drivers and vehicles for GP out-of-hours co-operatives is covered by the HSE.  </p><p>  In March 2010, the HSE published the National Review of GP t-of-Hours Services.  The review was carried out with a view to examining the existing models of GP out-of-hours service to identify best practice and make recommendations for the future development of standardised GP out-of-hours services, consistent with national policy and the HSE Transformation Programme.  The recommendations of the review are being implemented by the HSE on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The Review recognised that each HSE region should review the delivery of services by drivers with a view to providing services in a more cost effective manner, particularly with regard to the &lsquo;red‐  eye&rsquo; shift.  At the time of the review, the overall cost of providing drivers to the co-operatives amounted to &euro;11.5 million, which at that time represented 10.7% of the overall national cost of providing GP out-of-hours services.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy about the need to increase the number of vehicles allocated to the D-Doc out-of-hours service, the HSE has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In deciding whether to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, the Board must be satisfied that each medicinal product which falls within the group: (a) has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in each of its active substances as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group; (b) is in the same pharmaceutical form as, or in a pharmaceutical form that is appropriate for substitution for, each of the other products in the group ; and (c) has the same route of administration as each of the other medicinal products which fall within the group.</p><p>  In addition, the Bill provides that the Board is not permitted to add a group of medicinal products to the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products where, for example, any of the medicinal  products cannot be safely substituted for any one or more of the other medicinal products in the group. To further enhance the patient safety aspect of generic substitution, Section 13 of the Bill allows a prescriber to indicate on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should, for clinical reasons, not be substituted.</p><p>  I am satisfied that these provisions address the concerns raised by the Deputies.</p><p>  It is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the originator medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board.  </p></reply>

This shows an increase from 10.5% and 4.7% respectively from the previous survey in 2006/7.  Appropriate use of sedatives and  tranquilisers plays an important role in facilitating the health and well-being of many people.  However, I am concerned about the health risks associated with their inappropriate or long-term use and their more widespread availability.  </p><p>  The survey findings will further inform my Department in the review of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to imposing additional controls on benzodiazepine and z-drugs. Legislative amendments being considered include the introduction of an offence of unauthorised possession as well as import and export controls on such drugs.  It is also proposed to tighten the prescribing and dispensing rules applying to these drugs.  I hope to bring forward legislative proposals in this area in the first half of 2013.</p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction. The Employment Control Framework for the health sector sets out the numbers reduction target for 2012 and how the public sector wide moratorium is to be applied in the health sector. While the frameworks in recent years had exempted a number of grades from the moratorium, including consultants, the 2012 Framework does not specifically exempt any particular grade. Nevertheless, the HSE can make staff appointments, including consultant posts, once it remains with its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so. </p><p>  I take it that the memorandum referred to by the Deputy is a letter dated 20 July signed by National Directors of the Integrated Services Directorate and of Human Resources. That memorandum sets out the approach to health service recruitment to be taken in order to assist in addressing the serious budgetary situation facing the HSE. In particular, it outlines that except in a limited number of circumstances, all recruitment is to be paused with effect from the date of the letter.</p><p>  As the filling of consultant vacancies, by locum cover or otherwise, is a matter for the HSE in the first instance, the Deputy's enquiry in that regard has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it has become necessary for the HSE to suspend certain products from its list of reimbursable items.  This includes gluten-free products. Many European countries do not pay for food products under their Health Service Arrangements &#8211; the logic being that all persons need to buy food.  </p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.  A Supplementary Welfare Allowance Adult Diet Supplement may be awarded by the Department of Social Protection to eligible persons.  Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link:   .  Separate application forms are available for children.</p><p>  For persons who are not awarded a Diet Supplement, monies spent on gluten-free foods can be taken into account for tax purposes.</p></reply>

However, an overriding principle is that emergency cases should be admitted to whatever bed is available, regardless of the public or private status of the patient or the bed.  </p><p>  Under the current legal framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds in public hospitals.  As part of Budget 2012, I announced my intention to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.  In doing so, I was conscious of the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers. In discussions with the insurers,  I indicated that I was prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted in Budget 2012 for the current year could be raised through a system of improved cashflow.  I am pleased to say that this process is nearing completion.</p><p>  A range of factors will impact on any revenue estimates which will require further consideration.  These factors could include the number of patients treated as over-night or day cases, type of accommodation provided, e.g. private or semi private; rates of private patient charges, the proportion of patients electing to be treated privately with private health insurance and, the proportion of patients presenting through A&amp;E Departments that necessitate private accommodation.</p><p>  Currently, my Department is considering a number of issues and implications relating to the proposed legislation in advance of bringing the matter to Government for decision.</p></reply>

Seasonal Flu vaccination forms part of the Adult Immunisation Programme operated by the HSE.  Seasonal Flu vaccination is available every year as the vaccine changes every year to suit the strain of the circulating virus.  The vaccine is free to those in at risk groups.   Those aged 18 years or older in the medically at risk groups may attend either their GP or participating pharmacist for vaccination as they so chose.  Those medically at risk aged under 18 years should attend their GP for seasonal flu vaccination.  </p></reply>

The question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for Home Care services for older people is at present under consideration. The Department is examining this matter in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers. Legislation is currently being prepared  and various options are being considered,  including the complex legal issues involved, and the need to prioritise legislation across the Social Care area overall.</p><p>  Statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving the safety and quality of services and that other measures have or are being taken to improve Home Support  services delivered by, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This approach is reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, and includes a new public <i>Procurement Framework</i> for Home Care services (with quality and screening requirements); new <i>National Quality Guidelines for Home Support Services</i>, and new <i>National Home Help Guidelines</i>  . These various measures, taken together, have been designed to improve relevant aspects of HSE Home Care provision nationally, pending progression of the legislative proposals raised by the Deputy. In particular, non-statutory agencies at present providing Home Care on behalf of the HSE must comply with the criteria laid down under the current procurement arrangements including, for example, service level agreements.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that, outside of the existing procurement arrangements that the HSE has with certain non-statutory providers, these providers, or others, may compete in a growing sector in relation to Home Care for Older People. Such companies would obviously be subject to the normal requirements governing  the operation of business, including those governing profits and minimum wage.</p></reply>

A draft National Sport's Facilities Strategy was published as a discussion document on the Department&rsquo;s website in September 2012 inviting comments by end October. Submissions were also invited from interested parties, by end October 2012 on the future role and remit of Sport Ireland and how we might best deliver for sport in Ireland. (Sport Ireland is a new organisation which I propose to establish to merge the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority).</p><p> In addition and although not directly under the remit of the Department, over  50 Community Town Hall meetings were held this year all over Ireland to get communities involved in preparing for and identifying events for The Gathering Ireland 2013. These meetings were attended by thousands of people and hundreds of events and Gatherings have been identified by local communities as a result.</p></reply>
