The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.     </p>  <p>  Due to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years.  Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;764 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality is that available funds fall well short of the amount of work that could be undertaken. </p>  <p>  Taking into account our obligations under the EU fiscal rules, capital budgets are expected to continue to be tight for the next number of years and this will limit the scope for progressing new projects over and above the PPP programme currently under way.  While, therefore, I know that it is important to restore capital funding for the transport sector to ensure that land transport infrastructure is maintained, and renewed to support economic development, I recognise that it will take some years for capital funding to build back up from the current constrained level to more appropriate levels.</p></reply>

I understand that Uber has given an assurance to the NTA that it will use only licensed vehicles and licensed drivers and the NTA<font color="#1F497D"> </font>will monitor this position. On this basis the NTA are satisfied that the Uber model in Ireland is compliant with the prevailing legislation.</p><p>​At present, there is no legislation in place to regulate the carriage of passengers by rickshaws. Rickshaws fall within the definition of 'pedal cycle' for the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, as defined in section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  As such, they are obliged to obey the Road Traffic Acts and any regulations made under them, in the same way as other cyclists.</p><p>Rickshaws by their nature operate at a local level. Local authorities regulate many activities at local level through bye-laws made under local government regulation. In response to concerns, primarily health and safety, Dublin City Council (DCC), following a consultation process with relevant stakeholders, have prepared draft bye-laws under the Local Government Act 2001 to regulate the operation of rickshaws. It is my understanding that DCC, subject to receipt of certain legal clarifications, intend to bring the draft bye-laws, which would provide for a licensing regime for rickshaws, before the next meeting of the Strategic Policy Committee of the Council for their consideration.</p></reply>

It will also take account of the need to upgrade certain roads to improve access to poorly served regions, for large scale employment proposals, to complete missing links and to address critical safety issues. I am happy that the Plan will represent a positive response to meeting these various needs.</p></reply>

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  Due to the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years. Funding in 2008 was &euro;2.3 billion while funding this year is around &euro;764 million for the national, regional and local road network.  The reality is that available funds have fallen well short of the amount of work that could be undertaken.</p>  <p>  The Government will publish a new Capital Plan shortly. This Plan will take into account the maintenance and strengthening needs of the national, regional and local road network in order to ensure that the existing network is fit for purpose in meeting the needs of the travelling public and of industry and businesses. It will also take account of the need to upgrade certain roads to improve access to poorly served regions, for large scale employment proposals, to complete missing links and to address critical safety issues. I am happy that the Plan will represent a positive response to meeting these various needs.</p></reply>

Since the establishment of a cliff rescue service in the late 90s, the Unit has not been called upon to intervene in any lifesaving cliff recovery incident. This level of response does not justify the maintenance of a cliff rescue service, having regard to the risk associated with this activity.  </p>  <p>  Within County Donegal three volunteer CGUs are trained and equipped to provide cliff rescue services. While in Co. Mayo, the Coast Guard is working with the Office of Public Works with a view to commencing construction of a new purpose built Station in Westport in early 2016, and active consideration is being given to the construction of a new station to replace the existing CGU in Ballyglass.  In addition, the Sligo based Coast Guard helicopter is equipped to provide a day and night response to coastal emergencies, in addition to RNLI capabilities.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of local concerns, on the matter of Bunbeg and of the welcome growth of tourism and the increased level of adventure activities in the area.  However, you will appreciate that where a rescue service is provided; every effort must be made to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. It is in this context that the maintenance of a cliff rescue team has been de-prioritised. The primary duty to ensure the safety of people taking part in adventure activities rests with the provider of these activities.</p>  <p>  The Bunbeg Unit continues to be a well-resourced unit and is well equipped to fulfil its designated roles as a shoreline search team and rescue boat unit. I should also clarify that while the Coast Guard will use its best endeavours to coordinate the response to any coastal emergency, the remit of the volunteer Coast Guard service does not extend to being a designated safety provider to adventure and risk taking sports or commercial providers of such services. ​</p></reply>

Generally, a redundancy situation arises where an employee&rsquo;s job ceases to exist, and he or she is not replaced for such reasons as rationalisation/reorganisation, not enough work available, the financial state of the firm and company closure.  In such circumstances providing certain conditions are met, eligible employees may be entitled to a statutory redundancy payment.</p>  <p>  Where an individual employee ceases employment due to illness or occupational injury this is not a redundancy situation.

The maximum rate of pension is payable where a person has a yearly average of at least 48, and there are banded entitlements below that.</p>  <p>  In calculating the yearly average, the number of full-rate contributions paid and/or credited are counted up to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the number of years in their record up to that point.  For example, if someone&rsquo;s record was from 1971, and they turned 66 on 1 July 2015, it would be the contributions they paid or were credited in the period to 31 December 2014, divided by 44 years (i.e. every year from 1971 to 2014).  Taking the subsequent period into account to calculate the yearly average could only increase their contributions by a maximum of 26 contributions, and if their yearly average was already higher than that, this would have the effect of reducing their yearly average, rather than increase it, as the amended total would be divided by 45.  Given the fact that in most cases, this would result in a lower rather than a higher yearly average, it is to most people&rsquo;s advantage that the rule should apply as it does now.  However, the contributions can still be used to satisfy other contribution conditions (notably the 'contributions paid' rule in State pension contributory).  </p>  <p>  It should be remembered that PRSI does not just fund the State pension contributory and enable people to qualify for that payment, but also working age benefits before they retire.  The PRSI system does not make refunds in respect of contributions which do not end up being used to qualify for various payments.  To do so would reduce the sustainability of the PRSI system, and require an increase in the rate of contributions, and/or a reduction in the level of payments it funds.</p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes. </p></reply>

The property owner is specifically required to support a claim for the exemption by submitting a certificate, to Revenue, issued by a competent person as detailed in I.S. 398  Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material   Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, published by the NSAI.  This is the only type of certificate that is relevant under current legislation.  Revenue have no discretion to apply an exemption from LPT on foot of any other type of supporting documentation.  </p>  <p>  A review of the operation of LPT was recently submitted to me by Dr Don Thornhill and is currently being considered by my Department.  The review primarily had regard to recent residential property price developments, the overall yield from LPT and the desirability of achieving relative stability in LPT payments.  However it also addressed a number of matters relating to the administration of LPT, including the operation of the pyrite exemption provisions.  Any recommendations that are included in the review findings in regard to pyritic damage will be considered in the context of the upcoming Budget. Until then Revenue has no alternative but to apply the eligibility criteria as currently set down. </p>  <p>  A resolution to the pyrite issues may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and/or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013.  If legislative change is required, then I will examine the possibilities for its advance application on an administrative basis with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

However, in April of this year, the Chairman of the Committee wrote to Ireland's Permanent Representative to the European Union requesting certain tax information concerning Ireland and I understand that a similar letter was issued to all other EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Ireland has issued a detailed response to the Committee's letter which provides information in relation to:</p>  <p>- actions to increase transparency, including arrangements for the exchange of information on cross-border rulings in accordance with EU Directives and proposals to implement the OECD recommendations on country by country reporting,</p>  <p>- changes made to Ireland's  rules on company residence in last year's Finance Act,</p>  <p>- Ireland's support for, and participation in, the OECD discussions on BEPS,</p>  <p>- Revenue administrative practice on the issuing of advance opinions, including copies of Revenue's published guidelines in this regard, and</p>  <p>- Ireland's double taxation treaties, including a list of the 72 countries with which Ireland has signed a double taxation treaty.  </p>  <p>  While the Committee requested details of all tax rulings provided to companies in the period since 1991, Ireland was not in a position to provide this information as taxpayer information is confidential under Irish law and Revenue is prohibited from disclosing specific taxpayer information to third parties.  I understand that, for similar reasons, other Member States were also not in a position to provide the Committee with details of rulings provided to specific companies.  Ireland advised the Committee that, in responding to the Commission State Aid enquiries in relation to tax ruling practice, with which the Irish authorities have fully cooperated, Revenue had identified that the total number of advance opinions issued to companies on corporation tax was 99 in 2010, 128 in 2011 and 108 in 2012.  </p>  <p>  In response to the Committee's request for details of information shared with other Member States since 2010 under Article 9 of Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation, the Committee was informed that Ireland had spontaneously exchanged information with other Member States in 29 cases but that we were not in a position to provide details of the information exchanged in each case as this is specific taxpayer information which is confidential under Irish law.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response the Committee's request for information in regard to the maintenance of a national list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions, the Committee was informed that Ireland does not maintain such a list but that, as a member of the Global Forum on Transparency and Information Exchange, Ireland does not seek double taxation treaties with jurisdictions that do not meet the international global standard on transparency and information exchange.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Act is to ensure that consumers retain the protections they had prior to the sale of their loan.  The Act requires entities dealing with the consumer to be authorised by the Central Bank and subject to its Codes of Conduct.  Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad.  Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated.  Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm. </p>  <p>  All consumer and relevant SME loans sold by regulated financial institutions are covered by this Act.  Borrowers are therefore restored to the protections they previously had, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises. Borrowers who previously had access to the Financial Services Ombudsman also have this right restored by this legislation.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is currently undertaking a consultation process on the Authorisation Requirements and Standards for Credit Servicing Firms and Consequential Amendments to its Codes which closes on 30th September.  Included in its proposals are provisions which will ensure that a regulated lender who sells loans subject to the 2012 Consumer Protection Code to an unregulated transferee must, ahead of that sale, identify the firm who will provide the regulated activity of credit servicing for those loans post the sale and provide the requisite notification of their details to the Central Bank and the customer in accordance with Provision 3.11 of the Code. </p>  <p>  In addition, it should be noted that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the contract.  If a borrower considers that an attempt to change the terms of the contract unilaterally is being made, they should consider seeking independent legal advice.  In addition or alternatively, they could make a complaint to the regulated lender or regulated credit servicing firm as appropriate and progress to the Financial Services Ombudsman if the complaint is not resolved to their satisfaction. </p></reply>

The rationale for this approach is the risk of the uneven competitive market environment that would be created in circumstances where commercial state bodies operating in a competitive market were subject to FOI but their privately-owned market competitors were not.  This would be expected to have an adverse impact on the commercial position of the state body in question, which would not be in the public interest or consistent with the need to safeguard the State's economic and financial interests.</p>  <p>  Substantial information is, in any event, available on the activities of these commercial companies reflecting their obligations under company law, the information they provide to Government Departments and relevant sectoral regulators which is available for release under FOI or otherwise.</p>  <p>  While the FOI Bill was progressing through the Oireachtas, I came to the view, however, having consulted with my Government colleagues, that the rationale for excluding commercial state bodies generally from FOI, as set out above, did not apply to the same extent to certain State Companies which operate in a monopoly market.  On that basis, I made amendments to the FOI Bill to provide that Irish Rail and the energy network businesses of ESB Networks, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid would be subject to FOI.  Those amendments were accepted and provision was made for FOI to apply to those companies under the FOI Act 2014.  FOI already applied to Irish Water on the same basis under the 1997 Act and continues to apply.</p>  <p>  As the energy network companies and Irish Rail received significantly less advance notice that they were to be made subject to FOI than other bodies who were being made subject to FOI for the first time under the 2014 Act, I agreed that the maximum lead-in time provided for under the Act could be allowed in respect of these bodies to allow them sufficient time to make the necessary administrative arrangements required.  I have, therefore, provided by Ministerial Order that FOI will apply to these companies with effect from 14 October 2015.</p></reply>

These measures include adjustments to the application of the public service Pension-related Deduction (PRD) to the pay of pensionable public servants.</p>  <p>  I expect to bring forward legislation shortly to amend the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Acts 2010 - 2013 to implement the Lansdowne Road Agreement changes.  The planned PRD adjustments will be included in this legislation.</p></reply>

The primary role of the Naval Service Diving Section is to support Naval and other Defence Forces operations.  However, the Naval Service makes every effort to deploy to assist in maritime search operations following a request from the IRCG or from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  On the afternoon of Tuesday, 15 September last the Naval Service received an Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for assistance in the search for the missing person in question.  The Naval Service was unable to respond immediately due to the unavailability of divers at the time of the request.  However, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was advised that the Naval Service would keep the matter under review and on the morning of Thursday, 17 September, a diving team was dispatched to the area.  The team has supported the search since then until it was stood down yesterday when it was determined in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Coast Guard and in light of the weather conditions, that divers could no longer provide a meaningful contribution to the search. However, the matter is being kept under review.   </p>  <p>  The Naval Service has undertaken 118 days on fishery patrols off the North Mayo coast up to 21 September 2015. It undertook 64 operational days associated with the Corrib Gas Field in the 10 years from 2005 to 2015.  However, the vast majority of these operations were in the earlier part of this period.   </p>  <p>  During the period 12 to 18 September 2015 three vessels were deployed while a fourth was deployed from 14 September 2015.  The ships were deployed on fishery patrols, Aid to the Civil Power and on an overseas mission.  Decisions in relation to the deployment of Naval vessels are made on an ongoing basis by Naval Operations Command, in consultation with Operations and Plans Branch in Defence Forces Headquarters, having regard to, inter alia, the security environment, resource availability, patrol plans, weather conditions and any requirements arising from the various roles assigned to the Defence Forces.   </p>  <p>  While there are 46 qualified divers in the Naval Service, 10 are dedicated to the Naval Service Diving Section.  The remaining 36 divers fill various regular (non-diving) appointments in the Naval Service.  These personnel are not available on a dedicated &lsquo;call-out&rsquo; basis.  It may also be noted, that for a variety of reasons, 11 of the 46 personnel are not currently available to participate in diving operations.  These reasons include divers undertaking training courses abroad, those deployed in military roles outside of the Naval Service and persons currently unfit for diving duties.  The NSDS can deploy to a dive site on a Naval vessel, or, as was the case in this instance, by road.  The time to travel to a dive site is dependent on a number of variables.

A multi-faceted approach is being adopted including the following measures:</p>  <p> - establishing  the Irish Refugee Protection Programme which will provide international protection for up to 4,000 persons overall under Resettlement and Relocation Programmes.  It is expected that these numbers will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The first arrivals under the Programme are expected by year end.  The number of persons in need of international protection will be kept under review;</p>  <p> - establishing a new cross-departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  The Taskforce which has already had its first meeting, will adopt a whole of Government approach and will work with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to implement the Government's response to this crisis;</p>  <p> - engaging with the public on their pledges of support.  The Red Cross will lead this task;</p>  <p> - establishing a network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme;</p>  <p> - introduce the International Protection Bill as a major priority; and</p>  <p> - providing an additional package of processing resources to deal with major increases in asylum and other immigration cases, including the relocation measure, preparation for the Single Protection application process and increased enforcement across a number of areas, including removals.</p>  <p>  Ireland is participating in both Resettlement and EU Relocation programmes.  The resettlement programme for 520 people mainly coming from Lebanon and predetermined as refugees by the UNHCR has already commenced and the first Syrian refugees have arrived.</p>  <p>  At the emergency Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 14 September 2015, the Council formally adopted the measure to relocate 40,000 and Ireland has agreed to take a total of 600.  I attended a further emergency meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council yesterday at which agreement was reached on the relocation of a further 120,000 asylum seekers from countries in Southern Europe.  Our contribution under this measure is likely to be a little less than 2,000.</p></reply>

Specifically, the reduction has been made possible by reorganising the work of the courts including the establishment of multi-jurisdictional combined court offices which encompassed the transfer of management functions previously exercised by County Registrars to Courts Service management personnel.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised my Department that the position of County Registrar in Sligo has not been filled since the retirement of the previous holder in December 2009.  Since then the duties of the County Registrar in Sligo have been exercised by County Registrars from adjoining counties particularly the County Registrar for Donegal.  The Courts Service have advised that this arrangement, which also applies in relation to cooperation between County Registrar functions for some other counties, has operated satisfactorily and has not resulted in any diminution of services in Co. Sligo.  However I can tell the Deputy that I am currently reviewing issues relating to Country Registrar capacity in conjunction with the Courts Service.</p></reply>

These groups remain resolutely opposed to peace and are prepared to use violence to achieve their aims and, indeed, to support their lifestyles.  They reject the democratic will of the overwhelming majority of people on this island which was so resolutely expressed in support for the Good Friday Agreement.  I know the Deputy will agree with me that the people of this island want to move on and forge a better future for themselves and their children.  These groups are stuck in a past that everyone else wants to leave behind and they should simply stop.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is constantly engaged in intensive operational efforts against these groups and will continue to target them.  Co-operation with the PSNI is central to these efforts and, I am happy to say, that co-operation has never been closer.  There is a strong and resolute commitment on the part of the two services to work together and nowhere is this more important than in the area of security co-operation.  Constant contact is maintained between anti-terrorist officers on both sides and intelligence is shared in both directions with a view to making arrests and ensuring successful prosecutions of those involved in terrorist activity.  The House can rest assured that, with the Government's support, the Garda&iacute; will take all appropriate measures, within the rule of law, to defeat these groups.</p>  <p>  It might be helpful to add that the position with regard to this jurisdiction in relation to the Provisional IRA has been made clear in statements issued by me and by the Garda Commissioner at the end of August and it is consistent with the assessments of the Provisional IRA provided previously by the Independent Monitoring Commission.  In the light of recent developments in Northern Ireland An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is maintaining close liaison with the PSNI in respect of the investigation into the murder of Mr. McGuigan and I have asked the Garda Commissioner, in light of any new evidence emerging from that investigation, to let me have a fresh assessment of the status of the Provisional IRA.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the current discussions between the parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish and British governments, the British Government has arranged for an assessment to be made of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, which will include an assessment in relation to loyalist paramilitary activity.</p></reply>

The Hague Convention is a landmark in regard to inter-country adoption and provides an international architecture that prioritises the best interests of children. </p>  <p>  While it has signed the Convention, the Russian Federation has not ratified the treaty. This has prevented recent adoptions from Russia into Ireland. Over the last number of years efforts have been ongoing to try and reach a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation on inter-country adoption. </p>  <p>  Since  its establishment, my department has carried forward this work but significant issues remain in the way of an agreement. For example the Irish Constitution is very clear on the integrity of the family unit here and Russian requirements for post placement reports on adopted children pose a difficulty in that regard. </p>  <p>  My department has been working with the Irish Embassy in Moscow in seeking progress towards a bilateral.  </p>  <p>  In 2013 officials from the Russian Federation travelled to Ireland for a meeting. Officials from my department had considered going to Russia earlier this year., however this meeting was deferred. The Irish Embassy in Moscow has been assisting in liaising with the Ministry of Education and Science, which is the responsible department in Russia. </p>  <p>  I recently met with the Russian Irish Adoption Group to advise them on the current situation. Members of the group have adopted Russian children in the past, prior to the current arrangements, and many seek to adopt a sibling also from Russia. At the meeting I was deeply conscious of this reality and members of the RIAG gave a powerful presentation of the sensitivities involved.  </p>  <p>  I and my department take the view that it is essential to give clear, frank information about the likely time scale potentially involved in trying to secure an agreement with the Russian Federation. Families must have an accurate assessment of the time scales involved in order to allow fully informed decision making. I advised the RIAG representatives that  in practical terms, even  in the event of bilateral being finalised ,   it could take a further couple of years before adoptions with Russia could take place.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in an extensive work programme across a wide range of issues with a clear central theme; to work in the very best interests of children and young people, protecting and enhancing their lives. The issue of the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Russia must be considered in the context of the overall priorities of the Department in relation to adoption and the general focus of Ireland in regard to countries of origin for Inter Country Adoption. </p>  <p>  Work on the bilateral has not ceased and it remains the aim of the Department to finalise a bi-lateral agreement on inter-country adoption with the Russian Federation. However it will not be possible to finalise this agreement in the short-term.</p></reply>

International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  </p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.</p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit/risk profile for Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.</p><p>Up to the 15 July 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>2).  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to evaluate data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him/her. The child in question was born in the State in 2008. Her entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (the 1956 Act).<font color="#004080"> </font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.Two previous passport applications for this child have been refused under the Act by the Department on the grounds that her mother&rsquo;s lawful residence was insufficient to demonstrate her entitlement to Irish citizenship. </p><p>The current and third application includes an Irish passport for the child&rsquo;s mother.This passport was issued on 21 May, 2015 after she was naturalized on 10 April, 2015.  This establishes that she was not an Irish citizen in 2008 when her daughter was born and means that the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is still subject to section 6A of the 1956 Act. </p><p>However, in view of the child&rsquo;s lawful residence in the State since 2008 and given that her mother is now an Irish citizen, her parents can seek to establish their daughter&rsquo;s eligibility under the naturalization category of Irish citizenship.  To do this, they should contact the Department of Justice and Equality for information on applying.  If the child&rsquo;s application is successful, she will be issued with a certificate of naturalization.This certificate would serve to demonstrate her entitlement to Irish citizenship in any future passport application.</p></reply>

SOLAS, with the assistance of relevant experts such as the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), employers and local and national organisations, have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system.  The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development.  The higher education system is also going through a process of transformation through structural change arising from the Higher Education Strategy.</p><p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which is funded by my Department, advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy.  It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met.  The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise.  Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme.</p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to review the National Skills Strategy. The review will provide an opportunity to determine the volume, type and mix of skills required to meet the Government's goal of full employment by 2018 and the challenges to be addressed to achieve this.</p><p>  Direct engagement between employers and education and training providers is also critical to ensuring that programmes are aligned to changing skills needs.  As well as the actions that are being implemented across the education and training system as part of the Further Education and Training and Higher Education reform programmes to enhance links with enterprise and prepare learners for the different roles they will have over their working lives work is also underway in the context of the Skills Strategy review to develop the regional and national infrastructure for engagement between education providers, employers and other enterprise stakeholders, in communicating and addressing skills needs.</p><p>  You will also be aware of the increase in apprenticeship registrations in existing trades and the progress we are making in introducing new apprenticeships, focusing initially on the 25 priority proposals identified by the Apprenticeship Council through their public call.</p></reply>

In 2002, the Oireachtas enacted the Residential Institutions Redress Act in order to provide a means for making financial awards to assist people who as children were abused while resident in certain institutions in which the State had a regulatory function.</p><p>  In framing the legislation, the Government was conscious that a significant number of former residents who were eligible to make an application for redress in their own right, were in ill health or elderly and that it was probable that some victims would pass away before they would get the opportunity to finalise their application to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. With this in mind and in order to avoid a situation where a person's application would fail on death, the Government decided to include Section 9 in the Redress Act. This enabled the spouse or children of a person, who was entitled to make an application but died after the 11th of May 1999 (the date of the Taoiseach's apology) to make an application. </p><p>  Essentially, the legislation was applicable from the 11th of May 1999.  As with every such scheme, there has to be a cut off point and the decision was taken to use the date of the Taoiseach's apology as the cut off point.  It is not intended to revisit the legislation.</p></reply>

They include the Exceptional Needs Payments, Household Benefits Package, Housing Assistance Payment, Jobseekers Allowance Transition (where paid to the applicant), Mortgage Interest Supplement, Rent Supplement and the Back to Work Family Dividend. </p><p>  In addition to the various income disregards, the student grant scheme includes a number of gradations in income thresholds which allow students on different income levels to access grants at 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%. These gradations act as a safety net to ensure that students whose reckonable income is slightly above the threshold, can still benefit from grant support. </p><p>  With regard to the Student Assistance Fund I can confirm that the HEA has commissioned an independent review of policy, guidelines and practice in relation to the Fund.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with the then EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital.  Research indicates that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths.  The ban was subsequently extended to other urban areas.    </p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones.  My Department keeps the operation of the ban under regular review   . </p>  <p>   Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective.  The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.     </p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis.  The study includes- </p>  <p>  - an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels;</p>  <p>  - consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and</p>  <p>  - an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels.   </p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year.  However, it should also be noted that I plan to engage in further consultation on the matter of clean air in the coming months, commencing with a 'Clean Air Conference' hosted by my Department and the EPA in Dublin on 28 September, which will examine and discuss current and future challenges for clean air policy.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.</p><p>The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.</p><p>That report indicates that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter in some areas.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar to or higher than those in cities where smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.</p><p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels showed a slight increasing trend in the years 2008 ‐ 2010.  During this period, NO2 levels were close to the CAFE limit value in Dublin and Cork cities, due primarily to traffic congestion.  However, NO2 levels decreased from 2010-2012, and thereafter may have stabilised in 2013.  To further reduce NO2 levels in cities, we must develop and implement policies to reduce travel demand, emphasising sustainable transport modes such as cycling, walking and public transport , and improving the efficiency of motorised transport.</p><p>More recent figures from the EPA, for 2014, indicate that n o levels above the EU limit value were recorded at any of the ambient air quality network monitoring sites in Ireland.</p></reply>

Emergency calls are free of charge to callers on all telecommunications networks. The ECAS is funded through the Call Handling Fee (&ldquo;CHF&rdquo;), a fee payable by the telecommunications operator presenting the call. ECAS also manages an emergency text messaging service allowing deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired people in the Republic of Ireland to send an emergency SMS text message.  Following a competitive procurement process, the Department appointed BT Ireland to operate the ECAS initially for five years to 14 July 2015. This was extended for 2 years to 14 July 2017 following a detailed assessment of the costs and benefits of extending the current agreement and procurement of a new service. The total value of this contract including set up costs, operator salaries, accommodation and telecommunications costs is estimated at &euro;55 million over the seven year term.</p><p>The ECAS is performing to a consistently high standard and exceeding all of the performance levels set out in the Concession Agreement. It has handled over 10 million calls since it launched in July 2010 and has filtered out over 6.2 million calls allowing the emergency services to deal with genuine emergency calls. The average speed of answer for a caller to ECAS is 0.6 seconds which is one of the fastest in Europe according to a report by the European Commission <i>&ldquo;Implementation of the European emergency number 112</i>&rdquo;. Calls are passed to the appropriate Emergency Service in under 6.5 seconds on average with details of the emergency and the location of the caller.</p><p>My Department is in the process of preparing an invitation to tender (ITT) for a new concession agreement to operate the service with effect from 14 July 2017.</p><p>Details of the call volumes requested is set out in this following table:<table><tr><th></th><th>2014</th><th>2015 (to 1 September 2015)</th></tr><tr><td>Total Calls to ECAS</td><td>2,149,445</td><td>1,243,827</td></tr><tr><td>Garda</td><td>595,850</td><td>363,827</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>72,203</td><td>44,874</td></tr><tr><td>Ambulance</td><td>287,156</td><td>190,677</td></tr><tr><td>Coast Guard</td><td>7,811</td><td>5,270</td></tr><tr><td>Total Landline Calls </td><td>538,006</td><td>311,330</td></tr><tr><td>Total Mobile Calls</td><td>1,611,439</td><td>932,497</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that these figures only represent 112/999 calls to the Emergency Services and do not include other direct calls to local stations or offices.</p><p>The percentage paid by individual phone providers is commercially sensitive and is not provided in order to respect the legitimate commercial interests of the phone providers.</p></reply>

The most recent CSO Quarterly Tourism and Travel publication shows that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors (excluding air fares or ferry charges) for the first half of 2015 increased by 16.2%, compared to the same 6-month period of 2014.  There was  8.4% growth in revenue from Great Britain, 33.7% growth in revenue from North America, and 14.9% growth in revenue from Mainland Europe.  Other long-haul markets recorded growth of 2.6% in revenue .</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy &ldquo;People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025&rdquo; acknowledges that generating increased levels of overseas revenue is key for the future of Irish tourism and the Government&rsquo;s ambition is that overseas tourism revenue will reach &euro;5 billion by 2025 net of inflation, compared to &euro;3.5 billion in 2014.</p>  <p>  I have recently appointed a Tourism Leadership Group, to put in place a Tourism Action Plan that will set out the actions required in the period to 2018 in order that the overall objectives in "People, Place and Policy &ndash; Growing Tourism to 2025".  can be achieved.  I intend to publish the Tourism Action Plan in the first quarter of 2016.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out performance indicators to measure the achievements of these actions.   </p>  <p>  My Department and I also constantly monitor our national transport facilities to ensure that, given the resources available, they are achieving their greatest potential. An integrated and co-ordinated transport system is an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment. In making decisions as to future expenditure, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime or aviation transport in isolation from each other. In this context,  my Department published a comprehensive Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport in August 2015 which set out the priorities and key principles for investing in our transport network.  </p></reply>

For example, my Department supports the annual Culture Night event, which has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event, staged only in Dublin, in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is.  Culture Night 2015 had over 3,000 events in 1,500 venues.  Early feedback from the event has been overwhelmingly positive with many participating locations reporting larger turnouts than in previous years. </p><p>My Department also provides support to numerous other cultural events through the funding it provides to the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and a range of other cultural organisations.</p><p>Over the course of 2015, more than &euro;3 million per week will be invested by my Department in support of arts, culture and film in Ireland. </p><p>In addition, my Department is currently the process of developing a new National Cultural Policy. <i>Culture 2025</i>will reflect the important role that culture plays in our daily lives and will help integrate cultural policy within broader social and economic goals.  It will explore how culture can contribute to building an inclusive society, provide avenues for expression for our citizens, drive innovation and contribute to our societal growth and economic wellbeing.</p><p>The final policy document to emerge from this process will be submitted for the approval of Government and it is envisaged that the new policy will be published in early 2016.</p></reply>

Most recently in that context, my Department submitted a set of archaeological observations, with three specific recommendations in relation to the trackway, to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in connection with an Integrated Pollution Control licence application to the Agency earlier this year for peat extraction at Mayne Bog.  The form and extent of the archaeological excavation sought by my Department was directly comparable to the archaeological mitigation strategies adopted in relation to similar monuments on Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands.</p>  <p>  The archaeological investigations recommended by my Department to the EPA have since been carried out by the landowner under a separate licence granted by me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930.  The works were inspected and verified at the time by my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service. </p>  <p>  A report on the excavations has since been received and is being examined in my Department, which will liaise with the landowner in relation to any further archaeological work on the trackway that is determined from the report as being necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

The site was, until recently, in the ownership of the local authority.  In line with its statutory obligations under Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, and under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, the local authority consulted my Department during 2013 and 2014 regarding the archaeological implications of proposed works it was considering in the context of potential future development of the site. </p>  <p>  In response, my Department advised the authority of its view that the appropriate course would be to secure the preservation of any archaeological remains, by record, through an appropriate level of archaeological excavation and recording.  A programme of archaeological excavation, licensed by my Department under section 26 of the National Monuments Act 1930, was subsequently carried out.  The report on the excavation works will be considered by my Department, on receipt and will inform any future deliberations in relation to this matter, including any potential future referral to my Department relating to development impacting directly on the monument site.</p></reply>
