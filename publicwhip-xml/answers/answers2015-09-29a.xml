    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900052#WRA00700"><p>I have received a number of correspondence regarding these important historic buildings, including from the Deputy and the Cross Party Committee on Moore Street.  I believe NAMA has also received representations on the matter and have advised that these buildings were not part of the Project Jewel portfolio. </p>  <p>  The formulation and implementation of policy relating to the protection of Ireland s archaeological heritage is the responsibility of the National Monuments Service, under the Minister of Arts, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht. As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister of Arts, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht recently deemed 14-17 Moore Street a National Monument. </p>  <p>  Following that decision to deem the buildings a National Monument, I am advised that NAMA swiftly facilitated the sale of 14-17 Moore Street, by one of its debtors to the State. I am further advised that since my last correspondence with Deputy O'Sullivan on the matter, this transaction has been completed and 14-17 Moore Street are now in State ownership under the aegis of the Minister of Arts, Heritage, and the Gaeltacht.  As a result of this sale, 14-17 Moore Street no longer serve as security in relation to any NAMA loan. The contract for sale included all licenses needed to enable the State carry out the National Monument works including site access from all sides. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, whilst NAMA facilitated the transaction, the sale was ultimately a commercial matter between the owner of the properties and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as purchaser and therefore questions relating to the commercial aspects of that transaction should be addressed to those parties. </p>  <p>  The sale to the State has meant that the Moore Street National Monument has now come into public ownership and the long-term future of this historical landmark is secured. I am also aware that the 1916 Commemorative Centre is planned to be developed on the site and will be run as a public facility with access for citizens and visitors. The new Commemorative Centre will also enhance and complement the 1916 visitor facility currently being developed in the GPO.</p>  <p>  I trust the Deputy, and all those with an interest in the history of the 1916 Rising, will welcome this information.</p></reply>

According to the Central Bank, bank drafts represented 3.4% of all cheques issued in 2012, and just 1.7% in 2014. Over this time, the total number of cheques issued annually declined by around 20%, with the survey suggesting that approximately 1 million bank drafts were in issuance in 2014. Of these bank drafts, approximately 59% of the beneficiaries were consumers, 28% were SMEs, while the beneficiaries of the remainder (13%) were public sector bodies or large companies. </p>  <p>  This drop in usage would suggest that transactions which would have historically been done by bank draft are increasingly being executed electronically through Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) which is a more efficient transfer mechanism.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Special Liquidators published advertisements and wrote to all those known creditors in order to finalise their claims in the special liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited. Creditors in the UK and Ireland had until 31 March 2015 to submit their claims and those creditors in the US had until 31 May 2015 as part of this process. I understand that subordinated bondholders have submitted claims in the region of &euro;285m as part of this process</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Special Liquidators that they continue to adjudicate on claims by each creditor class. As the Deputy is aware the payment of proceeds from the liquidation, the costs and expenses of the liquidation, preferred creditors and senior unsecured creditors will all rank in priority to the holders of subordinated debt. </p>  <p>   I am advised that it will be some time before the Special Liquidators will be in a final position to advise on the likelihood of payment of proceeds from the liquidation given the ongoing adjudication process of creditor classes, including preferred creditors, other contingent creditor claims which may crystallise from litigation and the level of future receipts from the sale of the remaining assets.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900052#WRA01300"><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to tax relief in respect of rent paid, which is available at the standard rate to certain individuals renting private accommodation, which is their sole or main residence. Rent relief was introduced in 1982 to alleviate the cost of private rented accommodation for those aged 65 and over. In subsequent years, the relief was extended to all age groups. The level of rent qualifying for relief depends on an individual's marital status and age.</p>  <p>  In its 2009 report, the Commission on Taxation was of the view that in the same way as mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing; rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation and, as a result, recommended that rent relief should be discontinued.  The relief was abolished in Budget 2011, such that it is no longer available to those that commenced renting for the first time from 08 December 2010. Thus there is a considerable cohort of rental tenants that are currently not entitled to rent relief.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the impact that immediate withdrawal of rent relief in its entirety would have on those already in receipt of it, a decision was taken to gradually phase out the relief. The amount of rent that can be relieved is reducing on a gradual basis, culminating in the total withdrawal of the relief for the year 2018 and subsequent years. Tax relief at the standard rate continues to be available on a range of rental amounts depending on age and marital status. The current maximum amounts of rent relievable are &euro;2,400/&euro;1,200 per annum for a married couple/individual over 55 years of age and &euro;1,200/&euro;600 for a married couple/individual under 55 years of age.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of this relief was &euro;37.9 million, with 153,100 claimants.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to review the original decision in this matter, as I believe that any increase or reintroduction of such relief would end up being priced into the rents demanded by landlords, and thus provide no benefit to tenants. </p></reply>

Profits are recovering, balance sheets have been restructured and we have started the process of returning cash to the taxpayer following the huge investments that were made over the 2009-11 period. </p>  <p>  In relation to AIB, the State received a cash dividend of &euro;280m in relation to its holding of &euro;3.5 billion of 2009 Preference Shares for the first time in 2015. The State also received interest on its &euro;1.6 billion holdings of Contingent Capital Notes (CoCo) of &euro;160m. The CoCo is scheduled to mature in July 2016 at which point the State will receive  its final interest payment of &euro;160m and redemption proceeds of &euro;1.6 billion in capital. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Preference Shares, at present we are assuming a further cash dividend of &euro;280m to be received in May 2016 however, as the Deputy will be aware, work is continuing in relation to potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time. These decisions include considerations around the potential restructuring of the Preference Shares. Any decision in relation to the capital restructuring will have an impact on the expected returns from AIB in the coming year. While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer through our remaining shareholding in the bank. I have already confirmed that I will not take any decision in relation to the sale of ordinary shares in AIB in advance of the upcoming election.</p>  <p>    In relation to PTSB, in 2015 the State recouped &euro;509 million in capital receipts from the sale of shares (&euro;98m) and the repurchase of the Contingent Capital Notes or CoCos (&euro;411m) bringing the total capital receipts to c. &euro;1.8 billion since our investment in 2011-2012 and our current shareholding to 74.92%.  I have no current plans to sell any of the State's ordinary shareholding in PTSB.  </p>  <p>  In relation to future ordinary dividends in respect of our outstanding shareholdings in each of the banks, these are a matter for the boards of those institutions having regard to their financial performance and outlook along with their on-going capital and regulatory requirements.  </p></reply>

Following enactment, different parts of the 2012 Act have been commenced in  tranches at different times. This approach was taken, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and so has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. </p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

National debt interest expenditure for 2015 was projected in April at just over &euro;7.1 billion, a reduction of over &euro;300 million or 4.4 per cent on the 2014 outturn. Notably, this will be the first year-on-year reduction in National debt interest expenditure since 2008 and is largely due to the early repayment of the more expensive portion of loans from the IMF and its replacement with cheaper, market based funding. </p><p>National Debt interest expenditure in the first eight months of 2015 was just over &euro;4.5 billion.  This represented a year-on-year decline of &euro;306 million or 6.3 per cent primarily because of the reduction in interest payable to the IMF arising from the early repayments.

Some of the potential products include lower standard variable rates for existing and new customers, competitive fixed rate products and lower variable rates taking account of loan to value for new and existing customers. </p>  <p>  At the subsequent set of meetings which concluded last week I discussed a number of topics with the banks, including a review of the progress that has been made on this issue. The reality is that the majority of the lenders have now put options in place to allow borrowers to reduce their monthly repayments.   </p>  <p>  I would therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their particular circumstances or consider moving to another bank if the offer is not satisfactory. </p>  <p>  Central Bank research suggests that 21% of existing PDH variable rate mortgage customers could save by switching their provider. I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose existing customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge such customers. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p></reply>

The documents cover the period from 2003 to 2011. The published documentation is very extensive and includes materials relating to 42 Irish entities (that is, Irish companies or Irish subsidiaries or branches of foreign multinationals).  </p>  <p>  Following the revelations the Revenue Commissioners decided to look at the material relating to the Irish based entities and enquire into the circumstances of the transactions to see if they could ascertain whether the Irish tax system was being abused in any fashion (either by way of tax evasion or tax avoidance or to see if the transactions gave rise to any tax policy concerns that might need to be addressed through legislative action).</p>  <p>  I understand that Revenue reviewed the documentation on the ICIJ website and issued enquiry letters to every Irish entity mentioned in the documentation. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently examining the relevant transactions, the responses received from the Irish entities and any tax issues arising. When this examination is finished, Revenue will decide on what further action is necessary (for example, if a Revenue audit is appropriate in any of the cases). </p>  <p>  In addition, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they propose to write to my Department and provide it with a high level outline of the outcome of their enquiries, with a particular emphasis on highlighting any tax policy issues for Ireland that might be identified. </p>  <p>  Naturally, Revenue, for confidentiality reasons, will not be in a position to provide me with specific details in respect of individual companies. However, I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they will provide sufficient anonymised descriptions of the types of transactions involved and the possible impacts, if any, that such transactions could pose to the Irish tax system. </p>  <p>  The ICIJ documentation relates to certain (not all) tax rulings provided by the Luxembourg tax authorities up to the year 2011.

Discussions on this proposal are now at an advanced stage and Ireland fully supports the proposal. Part of the proposal is for a look back period of 5 years to apply. In other words, the directive would apply to cross border tax rulings made in the 5 year period immediately before the Directive comes into force. </p></reply>

No 147 of 2013) as having "significant pyritic damage".   </p>  <p>  Revenue administers applications for exemption from LPT for residential properties that have been certified as having "significant pyritic damage". The property owner is specifically required to support a claim for the exemption by submitting a certificate, to Revenue, issued by a competent person as detailed in I.S. 398  Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material   Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol, published by the NSAI. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a review of the operation of the Local Property Tax (LPT) earlier this year. The Review was carried out by Dr Don Thornhill who chaired the Inter-Departmental Group on the Design of a local property tax in 2012. While Dr Thornhill's current review focussed mainly on the issue of property price developments, it also considered and made recommendations on a limited number of other issues relating to the efficient and effective operation of LPT. I considered it appropriate that Dr Thornhill's review included the operation of the pyrite exemption for Local Property Tax.</p>  <p>  It was made clear during the passage of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act in 2013 that the exemption would be restricted to properties with significant pyritic damage, and that not all damaged properties could avail of the exemption. Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government in relation to testing/certification and the NSAI protocol were published in May 2013 and these restricted the LPT exemption to properties with 'significant pyritic damage' where such damage had been proven by the appropriate testing and subsequently certified. </p>  <p>  Before its establishment, it would have been envisaged that the Pyrite Remediation Board (PRB) would have remediated those properties that would have qualified for a LPT exemption and that the requirement to have the level of pyrite damage verified and certified would be a pre-condition for remediation. However, it transpired that only properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are being accepted for remediation by the PRB. Also, I understand that the PRB is not testing and certifying all properties that are being remediated. This gives rise to two issues; firstly, properties with a damage condition rating of 1 (with progression) are not being accepted for remediation by the PRB and, secondly, not all properties that are accepted for remediation are tested and certified. A property owner who might have only a damage condition rating of 1, or 1 (with progression established by a second test), and who wants to claim the LPT exemption has to spend &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 on testing and certification. Properties with a damage condition rating of 2 are accepted for remediation but are not eligible for the LPT exemption unless as they have the required certificate. </p>  <p>  The outcome of  Dr Thornhill's Review has been presented to me in report form and is currently being considered and will be published on Budget day.  I will outline my response to this very important issue on Budget Day.</p>  <p>  Any resolution to the pyrite issues may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) and/or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013. If legislative change is required, then I will examine the possibilities for its advance application on an administrative basis with the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that the statutory regime pursuant to which the CCMA was made has since been updated, as indeed has the version of the CCMA which was applicable in this case. The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.</p>  <p>  Where breaches of any regulatory requirements occur, firms and/or individuals can expect vigorous investigation and follow through by the Central Bank. The Central Bank regularly conducts themed inspections to ensure compliance with all of its codes of conduct, including the CCMA.  Breaches of regulatory requirements are dealt with using appropriate supervisory powers, including Administrative Sanctions powers, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  There is no legal issue, therefore, over whether or not regulated entities are to comply with this statutory code.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  The precise issue that arose before the Courts was the extent to which non-compliance with the CCMA could be adjudicated by the Courts in a repossession case between a lender plaintiff and a borrower defendant.  In that regard, the Supreme Court found that where a breach of the CCMA involves a failure of the lender to abide with the moratorium referred in the CCMA, but in no other circumstances, non-compliance with the CCMA affects a relevant lender's entitlement to obtain an order for possession.  Following on from this, a breach of any other aspect of the CCMA does not in itself adversely affect a lender's contractual right to possession in the circumstances of mortgage default.   </p>  <p>  The Supreme Court found that the CCMA prohibited lenders from seeking an order for possession where the moratorium was not complied with but that it did not prohibit the seeking of an order for possession in other circumstances. The Supreme Court has therefore ruled that where the Code of conduct prohibits the seeking of an order for possession the Courts will enforce that prohibition. To quote from the judgement of the Supreme Court:</p>  <p>  "A financial institution which, entirely ignoring the provisions of the Code in that regard, simply went ahead and sought possession as soon as it was legally entitled so to do would be doing the very thing which the Code is designed to prevent. For a court to entertain an application for possession which was brought in circumstances of clear breach of the moratorium would be for a court to act in aid of the actions of a financial institution which were clearly unlawful (by being in breach of the Code) and in circumstances where the very act of the financial institution concerned in seeking possession was contrary to the intention or purpose behind the Code itself."</p>  <p>  Where the code does not so prohibit and where it is not illegal for an order of possession to be sought then it is not a matter in which the Courts will intervene: It should be noted that the purpose of the CCMA is primarily to regulate the behaviour of the lenders concerned and it is principally a matter for the Central Bank to enforce the code and to regulate that behaviour rather than for the Courts. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the Supreme Court decision has in fact recognised that the CCMA forms part of the law and that a regulated financial institution is obliged, as a matter of law, to obey it. However, it should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.  </p>  <p>  The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory right to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.  If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.  Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,  insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.  Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the genuine concerns Deputies may have regarding the implications of the particular decision for borrowers in genuine difficulty with a mortgage on their own home.  While the full implications of the decision can be considered further, I think the effect that most concerns Deputies (that banks would not be obliged to consider any alternative repayment arrangements to address a mortgage difficulty), can be practically addressed by the Central Bank utilising its existing powers.  In any event the recent changes to the Land and Conveyancing Act and the Personal Insolvency Act has given a statutory right to a borrower to propose a sustainable solution to creditors, or failing that a court, as an alternative to repossession.</p></reply>

Achieving these growth rates is contingent upon many factors including trading partner growth and continued improvements in competitiveness. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Spring Economic Statement, the Government is using all policy instruments available to build sustainable public finances, improve access to credit and reform the income tax system. A carefully targeted capital investment plan will be used to alleviate supply side bottlenecks and barriers to growth. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will also contribute in this regard.   We have laid the foundations for a solid recovery with strong gains in our international competitiveness. We are also stimulating employment growth through the Action Plan for Jobs and ensuring that as many of those jobs as possible are filled by the unemployed though the Pathways to Work programme which provides work experience , education and training for the jobs of tomorrow. </p>  <p>  We can now clearly see an economy that is moving up a gear but I am conscious that economic recovery has not filtered through to all. The recently announced Village and Town Renewal Scheme is being introduced as part of a concerted effort to support the development and revitalisation of an integrated economy spread evenly throughout the country. A budget of &euro;30m over 5 years from 2016  is a component of a broader approach to rural development but also to improve the environment of rural dwellers in a way that will increase their quality of life and simultaneously support potential economic activity in their area. </p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead. But crucially, this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices. That is what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

The Government recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide these vital services to their members and  to ensure the stability of the sector into the future.  These measures include: </p>  <p>- the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;</p>  <p>- the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012;</p>  <p>- the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board ReBo;</p>  <p>- the establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable;</p>  <p>- the availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo; and</p>  <p>- the availability of &euro;250 million for resolution purposes.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo) is currently progressing its work plan re the restructuring of credit unions and to date has provided assistance in 21 completed mergers involving 50 credit unions.  The ReBo Board has approved a further 11 mergers, involving 23 credit unions in projects which will complete shortly.  A further 120 credit unions are being assisted at various stages in the restructuring process.  In total ReBo is currently engaged with 193 credit unions at varying stages of the restructuring process with a combined asset value of &euro;9.2 billion. </p>  <p>  Credit union strategy is a matter for credit unions themselves and is specifically provided for in Section 17 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.  The setting of strategy for a credit union is a function of the board of directors and Section 17 provides that this should be carried out in close co-operation with a credit union's management team.  However, I am always open to considering new proposals in relation to credit unions, particularly those that would see the development of the credit union business model and an increase in income for the sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework.  As set out in its feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  The safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector as a whole are priorities for this Government and I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted the Governments' recognition of the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement.</p></reply>

I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose existing customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge such customers. </p>  <p>  Competition is the best way to achieve a sustainable long term solution to the issue of high mortgage repayments and the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives in order to promote competition in the market.  For example, it introduced the changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 for new entrants.  This section regulates fees and charges and the changes mean that it does not apply for the first three years of operation of new entrants to the Irish banking sector.  It is anticipated that new entrants will enter the mortgage market and bring welcome competition to this sector. </p></reply>

The Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality where 0 represents a situation where all households have an equal income and 1 indicates that one household has all of national income.  According to the CSO, the Gini coefficient for household disposable income in Ireland was 31.3% in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. This compares to 31.7% in 2004 and the Gini coefficient has remained within a narrow range over 2004 to 2013.  In international terms, the Gini coefficient for disposable income in Ireland was marginally below the euro area average in 2013.</p>  <p>  Regarding wealth inequality, comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, was published by the CSO in early 2015. This is the first time such data has been collected.  The same data has been collected across the entire euro area according to a standardised methodology.  These data indicate that wealth inequality in Ireland for 2013, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, is lower than the euro area average.  The results also show that wealth is less concentrated at the top of the distribution here than the euro area average.  Central Bank analysis of these data also indicates that while wealth inequality has increased since 2011, it is lower than in 2006, the earliest period for which data are available.</p>  <p>  As regards Budget 2016, the Deputy will be aware that it is not the practice of the Minister for Finance to discuss in advance any measures which may be under consideration.</p></reply>

This report concluded that NAMA has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives; and based on its performance and financial projections in light of the strength of current investor interest in Ireland, NAMA is well positioned to achieve its overall objectives and so continues to be necessary.  </p><p>In the context of that review and as reiterated in his opening address to the Public Accounts Committee on 18 December 2014, the NAMA Chief Executive stated that NAMA aims to redeem a cumulative 80% (&euro;24 billion) of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2016 and that it hopes to have redeemed all of its Senior Bonds by the end of 2018 - two years ahead of NAMA's previous target of 2020.  He stated that these targets are predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio.  To date, NAMA has redeemed &euro;19.35bn, that is 64% of  the &euro;30.2 billion Senior Bonds issued. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that, entirely consistent with its objectives, the NAMA Board has undertaken to protect its ability to exercise a sufficient level of control to ensure the timely and coherent delivery of key Grade A office space within the Dublin Docklands SDZ and Dublin's Central Business District and more generally to maximise the delivery of residential housing units in areas of most need.</p><p>As set out in the NAMA Act, one of the specific purposes of NAMA is to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it.  I fully endorse the NAMA Board's strategy to take advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions by increasing the flow of assets to the market.</p><p>Given that these commitments were made by NAMA only in July 2014, it is too early to speculate as what date in the future NAMA will have made sufficient progress on its objectives as to warrant consideration of its dissolution.  I will be obliged to conduct another Section 227 review as of year end 2017 and will again take the opportunity to assess whether NAMA continues to be necessary at that point.</p><p>As regards accountability, it is again important to point out that NAMA is already subject to a high level of public accountability compared to other commercial bodies, including commercial bodies in the State sector.</p><p>In carrying out its functions the Board of NAMA must comply with its obligations under the NAMA Act.  The NAMA Board comprises seven members, five of whom, including the Chairman, were Ministerial appointments.  The Chief Executive of NAMA and the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) are ex-officio members of the Board.  The terms of office of Board members range between three and five years and no appointed member is eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms.</p><p>The NAMA Act (Section 18) sets out the principal responsibilities of the Board, which are</p><p>- to ensure that NAMA discharges its functions efficiently and effectively;</p><p>- to set strategic objectives and targets for NAMA;</p><p>- to ensure that the appropriate systems and procedures are in place to achieve the strategic targets and objectives;</p><p>- to take all reasonable steps available to it to achieve those targets and objectives.</p><p>The Board has also established four statutory committees, under Section 32 of the Act, to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities and obligations: Audit Committee, Credit Committee, Finance and Operating Committee, Risk Management Committee. </p><p>NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The level of disclosure in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements is comprehensive and professional.  I would encourage anyone interested in the workings and performance of NAMA who have not yet read these reports to take the time to do so as they are a rich source of information regarding NAMA's performance. </p><p>NAMA is also required to report to me on a quarterly basis giving detailed information about its loans, its financing arrangements and its income and expenditure. These reports, which also include other information specified under Section 55 of the NAMA Act, track NAMA's progress on a quarterly basis.  I am obliged to lay these reports before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis. </p><p>In addition, under Section 53 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is also required to submit to me an Annual Statement by 30 September each year setting out its proposed objectives for the following financial year, the scope of activities to be undertaken, its strategies and policies and its proposed use of resources.  I am obliged to lay these statements before the Oireachtas and I endeavour to do so on a timely basis. </p><p>NAMA's accounts are comprehensively audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. For large parts of the year - typically between September and MayC&amp;amp;AG staff are based in the Agency, performing their audit function, with unrestricted access to all its records and files.  If there is concern about a specific aspect of NAMA's work, it is within the power of the Comptroller and Auditor General to scrutinise any aspect of it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already produced three special reports on NAMA's activities and they have been broadly positive in their assessment of how NAMA is managing its complex business.  I note that as part of its upcoming third Section 226 triennial review of NAMA, the C&amp;amp;AG has confirmed that it will perform a value for money review on various NAMA sales transactions. </p><p>The Chairman and Chief Executive are also accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) and other Oireachtas committees and to give evidence to those committees whenever required to do so - and most recently attended the PAC on 9th July 2015.  I understand NAMA are scheduled to appear before the PAC again on the morning of October 1st.  Transcripts of these appearances are available from the Oireachtas website.  Furthermore, there have been numerous Parliamentary Questions addressed to me on NAMA-related issues and the associated replies are on the Oireachtas record. </p><p>NAMA also recently became subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, 2014 on 14th April 2015.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, NAMA operates a dedicated email address, , to enable TDs and Senators to raise any matter directly with the Agency.  I would encourage the Deputy, and indeed any member of the Oireachtas with a NAMA-related query, to avail of the email service.  I am assured by NAMA that all matters which are brought to its attention via this forum are fully, and promptly, responded to.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I do not accept that there is a need to make NAMA more accountable than is already the case.</p></reply>

This comes on the back of a similar increase of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter.  As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up over 3 per cent in the first half of this year and investment up over 20 per cent.  In fact, last year domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began.  This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs rich and tax rich.  The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by almost 14 per cent and imports up by 16 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had eleven successive quarters of solid annual employment growth.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.</p>  <p>  However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon the implementation of the right policy mix. The Spring Economic Statement sets outs a strategy designed to maximise the potential of the economy through a number of growth enhancing initiatives in the areas of taxation, access to finance and debt reduction. These initiatives along with a number of sector specific interventions will help ensure a sustained recovery over the rest of the decade.</p></reply>

This means that 120,000 people seeking asylum will be relocated to other EU Member States from Greece, Italy and any other State which may be hit by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries.  In a clear demonstration of solidarity with our EU partners, Ireland has committed &ndash; subject to Oireachtas approval - to opt in to this decision on relocation, as we have also committed to do in regard to the  previously agreed programme to relocate 40,000 people.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be seeking the approval of the Oireachtas for the exercise of the opt-in and officials in her Department are following up with the relevant EU authorities on the next practical steps involved.  </p>  <p>  The following day, 23 September, there was an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on the crisis.  There is broad agreement that a comprehensive approach is required to this complex issue, one which addresses both immediate humanitarian needs and the various factors which contribute to huge flows of people.  Progress is being made on many of the measures agreed at the April and June meetings of the European Council, including on reinforcing internal solidarity within the Union, developing &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; (specific locations for the processing of asylum appeals) and increasing co-operation, with or support for, those countries from which most migrants originate or through which they pass. Increasing our support for the UN and other agencies working with refugees and displaced persons is another priority.  Targeting criminal people-smuggling operations is also key.  Seeking to end the conflict in Syria itself &ndash; and creating conditions to allow for those in exile to return &ndash; obviously remains fundamental.</p>  <p>  Clearly, however much more remains to be done to implement these decisions and develop them further.  Justice Ministers will be working on a range of further proposals recently made by the European Commission and the European Council will return to the issue of migration at its scheduled October meeting.  In addition, Heads of State and Government will meet with our African counterparts in Valletta in early November, with a view to agreeing a Declaration and an Action Plan that would support initiatives to tackle the migration crisis more broadly.</p></reply>

It enables social welfare customers in receipt of certain payments to pursue full-time education courses and to continue to receive income support in the form of an allowance.  The BTEA is paid for the duration of the course of study, subject to the customer continuing to meet the conditions of the allowance and remaining eligible for DSP payment.  The allowance is paid weekly and replaces the customer&rsquo;s qualifying payment.  In general, most customers will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by SUSI. </p>  <p>  The operation of the BTEA has been comprehensively revised over the past two years and there are no plans to further revise the current arrangements given the value of income support already provided.  BTEA, similar to Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills/SUSI does not provide additional funding for participation on a course of study.  Some &euro;150 million has been provided in 2015 to meet the cost of allowances paid by Department of Social Protection which represents a considerable investment in supporting some 23,000 customers in the past year to acquire skills to re-enter the labour market. </p></reply>

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year, of which almost 4,300 are in Dublin, showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.</p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  Tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate. </p>  <p>  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,000 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans to extend this arrangement to Galway city.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss these measures are implemented as appropriate. Persons in receipt of rent supplement at risk of losing their tenancy are advised to contact the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service without delay.</p>  <p>  I am keeping this matter under close review.</p></reply>

Participation on JobBridge is wholly voluntary and is open to all jobseekers who meet the qualifying criteria, irrespective of their skill levels.  </p><p>JobBridge caters for new entrants to the labour market following education or training, and also unemployed workers whose existing skills are not appropriate for the types of jobs that are emerging in post- recession Ireland.  It offers an opportunity both for people with very low levels of education or skills who do not wish to return to school or college and those who have gained very high levels of education, but who need some practical work experience under their belt to compete effectively in the labour market.  To date, JobBridge has attracted voluntary participation from over 42,000 jobseekers and has encouraged over 17,000 host organisations to offer work experience opportunities to them.</p><p>In order to provide a JobBridge internship however, a host organisation must agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  These conditions include the requirements that the internship not be used to displace full-time paid employment and that the host organisation does not offer an internship in the same area of activity that they have made an employee redundant.  The Department has a robust screening and monitoring process in place, and each host organisation must agree to the Terms and Conditions at the outset of the scheme process, before their application will be validated.  </p><p>The Department also undertakes on-going monitoring of internships to ensure compliance.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and conducting random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship.  In cases where any breaches of the scheme are uncovered, remedial action is taken immediately.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found only minimal instances of displacement.  </p><p>The Department fully investigates any allegations of non-compliance. If the Deputy is aware of alleged instances of displacement he should inform the Department immediately by e-mailing so that they may be fully investigated.</p></reply>

These include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the respite care grant.</p><p>Total expenditure by the Department on carers has increased from just under &euro;752 million in 2010 to almost an estimated &euro;822 million in 2014. This is an increase of &euro;70 million or just under 10%. The overall number of caring recipients has increased from just over 76,000 in 2010 to almost 84,000 recipients in 2014. This is an increase of 7,815 recipients or just over 10%. These increases demonstrate very clear evidence that, despite the need to stabilise Government finances, the welfare system continues to play a very positive role in protecting, family carers in our society.</p><p>In relation to payment rates, the Government has protected core weekly social welfare rates generally during its period in office, and there are no plans to reduce weekly rates of carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or the respite care grant. The appropriate rates of welfare supports in the year ahead, including payments to be made to carers, will be considered by Government as part of its deliberations on the next Budget. The means assessment for carer&rsquo;s allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system and I have no plans to make any changes in that area.</p><p>Carers can engage in employment, education or training, outside the home, for an aggregate total of 15 hours per week. This strikes a reasonable balance between giving carers the opportunity to engage with wider society and to maintain, where possible, a connection with the world of work and education, and meeting the requirement that carers are required to be providing full-time care and attention to a recipient of care.</p><p>When the caring role ends, due to the loss of a loved one or due to a permanent admission to a care home, working age carers may apply through the appropriate Intreo office, for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and receive assistance in developing a personal progression plan identifying appropriate actions to facilitate a return to work.</p><p>Currently, carer&rsquo;s benefit and carers allowance continue to be paid for a period of 6 weeks following the death of a recipient of care, and any change in these transition arrangements to extend the grace period can only be considered in the context of budgetary deliberations by government.</p><p>The respite care grant (RCG) is an annual payment of &euro;1,375 for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. The payment is made regardless of the carer's means but is subject to certain conditions, one of which is that the period of full-time care and attention must last for at least six months (which must include the first Thursday in June when the payment is made automatically to recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance/benefit and domiciliary care allowance).</p><p>This year, RCG was paid to over 70,000 clients at an estimated cost of over &euro;124 million for the full year, and I should point out the grant, with no requirement to satisfy a means test, is not available for any other social welfare group nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.</p><p>Other supports from the Department for carers include free travel for recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance and, if they are living with the person they are caring for, the household benefits package.</p><p>Credited contributions (credits) are designed to protect the social insurance entitlement record of people, including carers, who are not in a position to make PRSI contributions.</p><p>Credits are awarded to recipients of carer's allowance/benefits in the following circumstances: </p><blockquote>-if the claimant was employed and paid PRSI contributions prior to receiving carer's allowance s/he may be entitled to credits. If, however, there is a gap of two years in the claimant's insurance record, credits are not valid until at least 26 PRSI contributions have been paid <br /><br />-if the claimant was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance (provided s/he has at least one paid Class A PRSI contribution), jobseeker's benefit or illness benefit immediately prior to claiming carer's allowance. </blockquote><p>In addition, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. This is achieved by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p><p>The habitual residence condition (HRC), as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions, guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not qualified for these payments in Ireland. The purpose of this condition is to safeguard the social welfare system, by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland. Staff are trained in the application of the relevant HRC factors  in the case of carers and there are  no plans to change the HRC requirement at this time.</p></reply>

Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible.  In this regard, the Department has had major success in clearing backlogs especially in the disability related schemes.  It is acknowledged that carers allowance applicants have been experiencing longer processing times over recent months, due in the main to an increased volume of claims. To address this, the Department has assigned additional resources to ensure that the processing time in carers allowance claims is reduced over the remainder of 2015.</p>  <p>  When a claim is awarded and put into payment the Department issues an automatic notification to Revenue, covering the type and amount of the payment involved.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.143.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900054#WRC02700"><p>The bereavement grant was a once-off payment based on PRSI contributions paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  The person on whose insurance record the claim was based was the deceased, or their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.  The overall concern in recent Budgets has been to protect primary social welfare rates. Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of approx. &euro;22 million.  This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant as there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than that which was provided by the bereavement grant, including &ndash; </p>  <p>  -  The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension which is a weekly payment, based on contributions or a means test. </p>  <p>  -  The widowed or surviving civil partner grant, which is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. </p>  <p>  -  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment to qualified people for six weeks following a death.</p>  <p>  -  Guardians payments where someone is looking after an orphaned child. </p>  <p>  -  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.  The Department official will also consider if a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union.</p></reply>

Free travel is also available on cross border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  Customers aged 66 years and over can travel for free on journeys within Northern Ireland.  There are currently approximately 836,000 customers in receipt of free travel at an annual cost of &euro;77 million per annum. </p>  <p>  The free travel scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State. Applicants who are under age 66 must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme.  The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  The Government will finalise its consideration of the Budget in the coming weeks and the outcome of this process will be announced on Budget Day.</p></reply>

These schemes are administered locally by local development companies, Local Authorities and local not-for-profit sponsor groups.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">The primary objective of these interventions is to support jobseekers, people with disabilities and other categories of customers in receipt of a social protection payment to receive training, work experience and/or income support.  Various community services and activities are also directly and indirect supported by those who are engaged.  The interventions play an important role in upgrading the skill level of participants and provide an important link to the labour market by maintaining the work readiness of participants. T&uacute;s and gateway were introduced as a direct response to the growth in the level of unemployment during the financial crisis while number on community employment expanded.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment falls, the Department recognises the need to adapt these schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.  While the Department has no plans for a single scheme, it must however reflect the changing circumstances and underlying rationale and resource commitments for the number of interventions now being delivered.  The Department will continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.  Some &euro;553m was allocated for the operation of these interventions in 2015 supporting around 39,000 people in work and training placements.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I remain committed to ensuring the ongoing recognition and support of the strong social inclusion</font>and community benefits that accrue from these schemes.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing approx. 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;168 million this year for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  While the decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was a difficult one it provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approx. &euro;237 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 415,000 customers. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s clients and particularly those who are living alone.  In Budget 2015, I was able to increase the rate of the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 per week.  The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the telephone allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  The Government will finalise its consideration of the Budget in the coming weeks and the outcome of this process will be announced on Budget Day.</p></reply>

To this end, the Department provides a wide range of work related supports, which in 2015 will cost an estimated &euro;37 million solely for persons with a disability. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s commitments to facilitating increased participation in employment for persons with a disability are reflected in the Comprehensive Employment Strategy. In addition, under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy an interdepartmental group will be established, under an independent chair, to review and make recommendations on 'making work pay' for people with disabilities through examination of the complex interactions between the benefit system, the additional costs associated with work for people with disabilities, and net income gains in employment.</p><p>In addition, a young person with a disability is at all times free to avail of the Intreo service on a voluntary basis and a complete range of activation supports for people with disabilities is available at Intreo Centres. The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in the Momentum programme. </p><p>Under the Youth Guarantee the main innovation in dealing with young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments relates to earlier engagement with this group than is normal under the general activation arrangements for unemployed people through INTREO. This will mean that young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments will be referred to a caseworker, and be engaged with more systematically in terms of their rights and responsibilities, at an earlier date than older unemployed people. For such young jobseekers, engagement with activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory. </p><p>The current situation in respect of young people with disabilities who present at a DSP office needing activation/intervention type supports is that they are they are already referred immediately to a caseworker within Intreo or at the Local Employment Service (LES). For such young persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis.</p><p>A caseworker working with a young person with a disability can arrange access for that young client to the full range of services and programmes that are available to young people on jobseekers&rsquo; payments. This includes access to programmes such as JobBridge, the Back to Education Allowance, and Solas training for unemployed people. </p><p>In addition, however, the caseworker can arrange access to a range of other services and supports that are specific to people with disabilities and are not available to other young jobseekers. These include:-</p><p><b>EmployAbility</b></p><p>EmployAbility is an open labour market initiative providing disabled people with supports to help them access the open labour market. It is implemented by sponsor organisations (EmployAbility) on behalf of DSP who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate objective is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support. </p><p>The Supported Employment Service under EmployAbility is an employment and recruitment service to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the open labour market. This Supported Employment Service provides a range of supports to employers and people with a disability, through Job Coaches. The range of supports includes:</p><p>-Individual Needs Assessment </p><p>-Vocational Profiling and Career Planning </p><p>-Individual Employment Plan </p><p>-Job Sourcing and Job Matching </p><p>-On-the-Job Support and Coaching </p><p>-Advice and Support to Employers </p><p>-Follow-up Support and Mentoring to both Employers &amp;amp; Employees.</p><p><b>The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)</b></p><p>The purpose of this demand - led programme is to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market. WSS provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.  The Scheme is structured in three strands.  The employer can benefit from one or all, simultaneously. </p><p><i>Strand I subsidy</i>- is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a disabled person, in comparison to a non-disabled peer.  An employee must work a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 hours per week.The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and is based on the number of hours worked, giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on 39 hour week.  </p><p><i>Strand II</i>- is based on the total number of disabled employees in a company, an employer can apply for a grant to cover additional costs ranging from an additional 10% for 3-6 employees to a maximum of 50% of the wage subsidy for 23+ disabled employees.</p><p><i>Strand III</i>- is where 30 or more disabled people are employed, employers can avail of a grant of &euro;30,000 per annum to assist with the cost of employing an Employment Assistance Officer.</p><p>Unlike other recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus, WSS is payable indefinitely as long as the disabled person remains in the employment concerned. New Applicants for WSS who are currently on Disability Allowance may apply for DA Disregard in conjunction with the WSS provided the minimum 21 working hours per week WSS threshold is maintained.</p><p><b>Disability Support/Awareness</b></p><p>A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under this heading. </p><p>A. Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant</p><p>B. Job Interview\Personal Reader Grant </p><p>C. Employee Retention Grant Scheme. </p><p>D. Disability Awareness Support Scheme</p><p><b>Community Employment</b></p><p>The CE eligibility requirements for people with disabilities are not as demanding as for other Job seeker groups so as to encourage participation. Those on job-seekers&rsquo; payments generally must be aged over 25 and on a payment for a year or more.  Effectively a person in receipt of DA who is aged 18 or over can be in receipt of their payment for 1 week and be eligible for CE. </p><p><b>Specialist Training Providers</b></p><p>Apart from having access to the full range of training programmes for unemployed people provided through Solas, people with disabilities also have access to Specialist Training Programme provision specific to their needs.</p><p>Key additional features of specialist vocational training, as compared with programmes for the generality of unemployed job-seekers, include:</p><p>-additional training duration</p><p>-adapted equipment</p><p>-transport arrangements</p><p>-enhanced programme content</p><p>-trainer-learner ratio</p><p>-qualifications of staff</p><p>-additional opportunities for assessment</p><p>-individualised approach.</p><p>In the light of the enhanced existing arrangements already in place for young people with disabilities, it was not necessary to make further adjustments in the context of the changes being made to the treatment of young recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments under the youth guarantee implementation plan.</p><p>Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to develop and evaluate options for the further extension of employment services to people not on the live register and to improve the promotion/communication of existing activation options for this group, and young people with disabilities will be considered in that context. The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in future initiatives of  the Momentum programme.</p></reply>

Over 13,700 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year, of which almost 4,300 are in Dublin, showing that significant numbers are being accommodated under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients.</p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants. Staff in the Community Welfare Service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power (provided for under Article 38 of Statutory Instrument 412 of 2007) to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness. Tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate using the statutory discretion as outlined in the correspondence supplied by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  This flexible approach has already assisted approximately 4,000 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special Protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans to extend this arrangement to Galway city. The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss these discretionary measures are implemented as appropriate. Persons in receipt of rent supplement at risk of losing their tenancy are advised to contact the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service without delay.</p>  <p>  I am keeping this matter under close review.</p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided an annual saving of approx. &euro;22 million.  This allowed the Department to protect other more fundamental social welfare payments such as the State pension.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reinstate the bereavement grant as there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than that which was provided by the bereavement grant &ndash; </p>  <p>  - The widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pension which is a weekly payment, based on contributions or a means test. </p>  <p>  - The widowed or surviving civil partner grant, which is a once-off payment of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child. </p>  <p>  - A number of social welfare payments, including State pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, continue in payment to qualified people for six weeks following a death. </p>  <p>  - Guardians payments where someone is looking after an orphaned child. </p>  <p>  - A special funeral grant of &euro;850 where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  The assistance is toward the costs of the necessary basic requirements for a dignified funeral.  However, there is no automatic entitlement to such a payment.  An ENP is a means tested payment payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies, etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial costs.

Despite pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million. </p><p>The programme is in place to provide support to disadvantaged children and priority is given to schools which are part of the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiative for disadvantaged schools, &lsquo;Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools&rsquo; (DEIS). The additional funding provided in 2015 is being used to increase payments to existing DEIS schools with a particular focus on the provision of funding for breakfast clubs which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels. The Department is at present processing applications for the current school year.  </p><p>The cost of extending the scheme to additional schools or food clubs can only be quantified where more specific information is available such as the number of disadvantaged pupils participating. The Department is not in a position to provide a breakdown of the cost of food clubs to local groups and voluntary organisations which operate their own school meals projects.  Details of the various food clubs available under the scheme and the maximum daily rate per pupil are provided in the attached tabular statement.  </p><p>Based on the 2015 budgetary allocation of &euro;39 million, the additional annual cost of expanding the school meals programme by 15% is &euro;5.85 million, at a cost of approximately &euro;2 million in the first year covering the school term from September to December. Any changes to social welfare schemes can only be considered in a budgetary context. </p><p><b>School Meals Food Clubs</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Meal</th><th>Maximum <br /><br />Rate of Payment <br /><br />(per child per day)</th><th>Examples of Food to be Provided</th></tr><tr><td>Breakfast/Snack</td><td>&euro;0.60</td><td>Cereal, Toast, Scone, Fruit, Yogurt, Milk, Unsweetened Juice-2 Items must be provided</td></tr><tr><td>Lunch</td><td>&euro;1.40</td><td>Filled Sandwich/Roll or Soup &amp;amp; Roll or Salad Plate, plus 2 other items (e.g. Milk, Unsweetened Juice, Fruit, Yogurt)</td></tr><tr><td>Dinner</td><td>&euro;1.90</td><td>Meat, Potatoes &amp;amp; Vegetables or Chicken Curry or Spaghetti Bolognaise, plus a drink (Milk, Unsweetened Juice, Water)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy, initiated in 2012. The 2015 update of the strategy focuses especially on provision of services, and on provision of new places, or reserved places on existing programmes, for the long-term unemployed and the youth unemployed. These programmes are therefore an important element in the overall policy approach.</p><p>Data on participation on the main activation programmes are published each month by the CSO. The data for July 2015 are reproduced below.  There were 67,246 people availing of these programmes in July, which is an increase of 2,630 (4.1%) persons compared with the same month in 2014. The numbers on the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) increased by 1,628 over the same period and includes 2,731 participating on Momentum full-time courses (437 in July 2014) and 107 participating on Springboard/ICT Skills Programme. It should be noted that participation on the BTEA tends to be at a seasonal low in summer, and to rise substantially during the academic year.<table><tr><th><b>Programme</b></th><th><div><b>Participants at Jul-15</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Back to Work allowance scheme &ndash; Employee strand.<sup>1</sup></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise allowance scheme &ndash; self-employed strand.</td><td><div>11,739</div></td></tr><tr><td>Short-term Enterprise Allowance<sup>2</sup></td><td><div>486</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total - Back to Work schemes</b></td><td><div><b>12,225</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>Part-time Job Incentive </td><td><div>358</div></td></tr><tr><td>T&Uacute;S - Community Work Placement Initiative</td><td><div>8,014</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge -National Internship Scheme</td><td><div>4,969</div></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway (2013)</td><td><div>2,258</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Other Activation Programmes</b></td><td><div><b>15,599</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)<sup>3</sup></td><td><div>5,000</div></td></tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance<sup>4</sup></td><td><div>4,976</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total - Back to Education Courses:</b></td><td><div><b>9,976</b></div></td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment Schemes (excluding Supervisors)</td><td><div>22,913</div></td></tr><tr><td>FAS (Solas) full time training for the unemployed </td><td><div>6,533</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL</b></td><td><div><b>67,246</b></div></td></tr></table></p><p><sup>1</sup>This scheme was closed to new applications from 1st May 2009.</p><p><sup>2</sup>This scheme was introduced from 1st May 2009.

The Government recognises this and has put in place a number of measures to ensure that credit unions can continue to provide these vital services to their members and to ensure the stability of the sector into the future. These measures include: </p><p>-the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions;</p><p>-the publication of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012;</p><p>-the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring BoardReBo;</p><p>-the establishment of a stabilisation levy to support credit unions that are undercapitalised but are otherwise viable;</p><p>-the availability of &euro;250 million for voluntary restructuring of credit unions facilitated by ReBo; and</p><p>-the availability of &euro;250 million for resolution purposes.</p><p>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.</p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p><p>Credit union strategy is a matter for credit unions themselves and is specifically provided for in Section 17 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.

Following enactment, different parts of the 2012 Act have been commenced in tranches at different times. This approach was taken, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and so has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates.</p>  <p>  I have not yet signed a commencement order for the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which covers the following areas: reserves; liquidity; lending; investments; savings; borrowing; systems, controls and reporting arrangements; and services exempt from additional services requirements.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.  </p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. </p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles, it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members.  </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

Typically, this does not involve the shift of substantive activity to Ireland or liability for tax. However, it does mean that corporate income on worldwide activity is recorded as a credit (an income inflow) on the Irish current account, improving the balance. These such companies are regularly referred to as &quot;re-domiciled PLCs&quot;.</p><p>Central Statistics Office (CSO) estimates of the net effect on primary income in the current account of the Irish Balance of Payments of these re-domiciled PLCs are set out in the table below.

I have been informed by the Central Bank that where individual credit unions intend to establish such a fund, the Central Bank would expect the credit union to take account of the need to ensure the protection of the funds of its members. </p>  <p>  The remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank.  While section 44 will not in itself be changed, the power to make regulations in relation to investments in projects of a public nature is specifically referenced in legislation and therefore such investments could be facilitated by future regulations, where appropriate, when there are specific proposals put forward by the credit union sector. While to date the Central Bank has not received any specific proposals regarding investment projects of a public nature, the Central Bank informs me that it is willing to consider such proposals including the type of regulations that would be required to facilitate such proposals. </p>  <p>   In relation to dormant accounts, the Dormant Accounts Act, 2001 (as amended) provides for accounts in credit institutions to be transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund when an account has been dormant for 15 years. Credit unions are currently not subject to the dormant accounts legislation. Accordingly, accounts in credit unions that have not been reclaimed by the owners for at least 15 years are not transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 (as amended) does not make reference to Dormant Accounts. Dormant accounts in credit unions, and the practices surrounding them, are governed by Rule 22 of the Standard Rules for Credit Unions published by the Irish League of Credit Unions.</p></reply>

Following enactment, specific sections of the 2012 Act have been commenced at different times. This approach was agreed with credit union stakeholders, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and this has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.  These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. </p>  <p>  The remaining sections of the 2012 Act relate to: Reserves; Liquidity; Lending; Investments; Savings; Borrowing; Systems, Controls and Reporting Arrangements; and Services Exempt from Additional Service Requirements. The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.  </p>  <p>  Under the regulations credit unions will continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years. In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years). Approval will be subject to conditions set by the Central Bank. As indicated in CP88, the Central Bank is reviewing the conditions that currently apply for credit unions to be approved to extend their longer term lending limits.  </p>  <p>  The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.  I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted and provided with additional information on its application criteria regarding the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry of Credit Unions will provide an application form and an explanatory notes to assist credit unions in making an application. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.  It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period.  Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. </p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

However, a property that is derelict to such an extent that it is not suitable for occupation (or not actually occupied) is not taxable. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is up to a property owner to 'self-assess' as to whether a property is liable or not. This means that, in the case of LPT, there is normally no requirement on the owners of derelict property to declare such structures as taxable, unless the property owner receives a notification and/or valuation estimate from Revenue. </p>  <p>  In such circumstances the onus is on the property owner to inform Revenue that the property is derelict and unfit for habitation. The property owner may also have to provide supporting documentation to Revenue to back up his or her claim. Depending on the circumstances of the case, Revenue may or may not agree that a particular property is not liable to LPT.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed to me that while it is not possible to provide a prescriptive set of criterion for derelict properties, it advises property owners as a general rule to take account of the structure of the building including whether it has a roof, windows and sanitary facilities. However the lack of utilities such as water or electricity does not necessarily mean a residential property can be regarded as derelict. </p>  <p>  Where a derelict property is renovated to a habitable level, it becomes a 'relevant residential' property for LPT and is liable from the following valuation period. For example, if a property is renovated between 1 May 2013 and 1 November 2016, the first valuation period, then it becomes liable for LPT from 1 January 2017 onwards. </p></reply>

This is a very important initiative, which will mean that NAMA will bear the upfront capital cost of delivering Part V housing on estates that it funds and that such housing will be delivered on site in line with Government policy aimed at ensuring greater integration in housing. </p>  <p>  The 6,500 residential properties made available by NAMA for social housing represents the totality of vacant residential properties within NAMA's portfolio that were potentially suitable for social housing.   The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market and in that way have contributed to increased market supply.  NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities. The remaining properties made available by NAMA were ultimately deemed unsuitable by local authorities based on criteria such as their location and on wider planning and housing policy considerations or they were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers during the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm their suitability. </p>  <p>  In addition to this initiative, NAMA is funding the construction of new residential properties to help meet demand in the major urban centres.  NAMA has, in this respect, committed to funding the construction of 4,500 new properties in the Dublin area in the three years to end 2016 and is firmly on track to achieve this target.  Last year, NAMA funded the construction of nearly 50% of all new residential properties built in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that approximately 7,599 acres of residentially zoned land secure its loans, however a proportion of this is in areas where there is limited or no demand for new supply whilst, within the main urban centres, residentially zoned land may not be suitable for development in the short to medium term for a number of reasons including infrastructure deficits and other issues.  NAMA has an active land strategy in place for every acre of residentially zoned land in areas where there is demand.  Reflecting this, in Dublin NAMA has an exposure through its loans to approximately 30% of zoned residential land but is currently funding more than 40% of new housing output. </p>  <p>  As a member of the Dublin Housing Task Force, NAMA has identified all the Tier 1 lands (i.e. sites with potential to deliver more than 20 units) on its books with residential planning already in place.  These, along with all other non-NAMA Tier 1 sites in the Dublin area, have been published via an interactive map on the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government website. This action has brought greater transparency to the Dublin market by publically providing detailed information on sites with development potential.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, as part of its contribution to address emerging residential supply shortages in the Greater Dublin area, NAMA established a dedicated Residential Delivery team to coordinate and drive the delivery of this commitment and assess the potential for delivery of additional units thereafter.</p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA is currently focused on doing all that is necessary to bring sites in its portfolio to a shovel-ready state and has active strategy in place for every acre of residentially-zoned land within its portfolio. That includes assessing commercial viability and facilitating debtors and receivers in the preparation and submission of planning applications.    </p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that they offer a range of service channels which are adapted to meet the changing demands of taxpayers. Over the last number of years the provision of high quality self service, electronic and telephone service channels has resulted in reduced demand for 'walk in' counter services by taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Between 2008 and 2014 there was a 61% reduction in 'walk in' callers to the Tallaght Revenue Information Office (TRIO). Having regard to the changing nature of the demand for service, the Revenue Commissioners introduced an appointments service in the TRIO in July of this year. A dedicated telephone line for the purposes of making appointments is operated Monday to Friday from 09:30 to 16:00 and appointments are facilitated in the TRIO Wednesday to Friday from 09:30 to 13:00. If, during the course of the initial telephone conversation, the Revenue official identifies a more efficient and cost effective means for the taxpayer to carry out their business they will advise and assist them in this regard. A taxpayer who elects to carry out their business through the appointments service is facilitated at a time and on a day which suits them. </p>  <p>  Since its introduction the appointments service in TRIO received 2,667 phone calls up to the 22 September 2015. Of these only 223 (8%) taxpayers elected to make an appointment. 92% of callers had queries which were either dealt with immediately or handled via other service channels. </p>  <p>  Revenue have advised me that the appointments service in the TRIO continues to be subject to ongoing close monitoring and review and taxpayers will continue to be provided with a flexible and responsive service commensurate with demand.</p></reply>

I also met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the interest rates being charged to Irish customers were too high. Furthermore, I stressed to the banks that they should treat new and existing customers in a fair manner. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. </p><p>I have recently concluded a further series of meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers to reduce their monthly repayments. I am pleased to see that the majority of lenders have offered their new reductions and products to both new and existing customers.</p><p>I would therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their particular circumstances or consider moving to another bank if the offer is not satisfactory. </p><p>Central Bank research suggests that 21% of existing PDH variable rate mortgage customers could save by switching their provider. I expect that if financial institutions are convinced that there is a threat that they will lose existing customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge such customers. Competition rather than legislation represents most sustainable long-term solution to this problem. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website <i>www.consumerhelp.ie</i>is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.</p><p>Legislation could have significant negative implications for competition and reduce the offerings available to new and switching customers.</p></reply>

Following the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) this changed with a number of supervisory responsibilities and decision making powers moving to the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>  <p>  The core objectives of the Bank in supervising Credit Institutions are: </p>  <p>  - to foster a stable banking system; </p>  <p>  - to provide protection to depositors with individual credit institutions </p>  <p>  As appropriate, the Bank's powers in respect of loan loss provisioning are limited to those prudential powers conferred on the Bank by the European Communities (Capital Adequacy of Credit Institutions) Regulations 2006 (i.e. the regulations transposing the European Capital Requirements Directive (CRD III)) and the European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulation 2014 and its other general supervisory powers.  </p>  <p>  Under Regulation 70 of the 2006 Regulations, the Bank was obliged to require any credit institution that did not meet the requirements of the 2006 Regulations to take the necessary actions or steps at an early stage to address the situation. Such measures included requiring credit institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets, in terms of own funds requirements; obliging credit institutions to hold own funds in excess of the minimum level set out in Regulation 19; and requiring credit institutions to use net profits to strengthen the capital base. The Bank has comparable powers under Regulation 92 of the European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulation 2014. </p>  <p>  As the prudential regulator, the Bank aims to ensure that credit institutions are adequately capitalised at all times. It regards the issue of losses on loan portfolios as very important and aims to ensure that banks hold adequate capital in respect of such losses.  The Bank has not outsourced its responsibility for identifying losses at credit institutions. Under the Regulations, the Bank has the power to set overall capital adequacy standards and, depending on the circumstances, may rely on those powers to increase capital in the event provisions are assessed as inadequate. </p>  <p>  The Bank availed of this power under Regulation 70 in the case of the credit institutions subject to the Bank's Prudential Capital Assessment Review. A similar approach underpinned the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) approach under the 2014 Comprehensive Assessment exercise. I would expect the Bank to utilise such powers in any cases where it assesses a bank's provisioning to be inadequate.</p>  <p>  The Bank has limited ability to influence provisioning practices within the confines of the existing accounting framework although it did publish Impairment Provisioning and Disclosure Guidelines in December 2011 which were revised and reissued in May, 2013.  However, the Bank does not have legal power to require credit institutions to reclassify assets and/or to increase their provisioning level beyond that required under IAS 39 for financial reporting purposes to shareholders. </p>  <p>  The European Communities (Credit Institutions: Accounts) Regulations 1992 contain specific requirements regarding the preparation of accounts by credit institutions and in principle, the Bank has power to bring proceedings in relation to a breach of those requirements. However, in respect of prosecuting credit institutions that fail to provide adequately for loan losses in their accounts, the power conferred on the Bank under Regulation 15 is of a very circumscribed nature, where the credit institution in question complied with either local GAAP or IFRS in preparing its accounts. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has no enforcement role regarding obligations imposed by the Companies Acts in respect of the maintenance of proper books of account and the preparation and publication of accounts which is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Neither has the Bank a role in enforcement of accounting standards which is a matter for the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA).</p></reply>

Settled case law requires that such exemptions be strictly interpreted and narrowly applied so as not to create or increase divergence of VAT treatment in the EU Member States. As the kinds of products listed in your question were not zero rated in 1991, the standard rate applies and there is no scope to apply the zero rate.</p>  <p>  The details attached suggest that non-Irish suppliers of such products may not be applying the correct VAT rate; if the Deputy has such information I suggest that he pass it to the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

However, there are general reliefs and exemptions that might be available in the type of situation envisaged.</p><p>For the purposes of CAT, the position is that the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the maximum tax-free threshold known as the &quot;group threshold&quot; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.</p><p>There are, in all, three separate group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p><p><b>Group A: &euro;225,000 -</b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p><p><b>Group B: &euro;30,150- </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. </p><p><b>Group C: &euro;15,075-</b>applies in all other cases.</p><p>Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same group threshold are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit. Tax at the rate of 33% is payable on any excess received over the relevant tax-free threshold.</p><p>Apart from the tax-free group thresholds available to a beneficiary, there is also a full tax exemption where a dwelling-house is received by way of a gift or inheritance in certain circumstances.</p><p>The main conditions attaching to the dwelling-house exemption are that the beneficiary must have lived in the dwelling-house for a minimum of three years prior to the receipt of the gift or inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling-house.</p><p>This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of gift or inheritance tax when it is transferred. The exemption is available to any beneficiary who meets the conditions for the exemption, irrespective of whether or not they are related to the disponer, and irrespective of the value of the property being acquired.</p><p>Where a person has a CAT liability, he or she has a statutory entitlement to pay this liability by monthly instalments over a period of up to five years.  Instalments are subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period of time in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. In cases of hardship, Revenue also has the discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as they think fit. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the inheritance involved.</p></reply>

However, I have not yet made any decision under Sections 32D and 32E on the 2015 levies that will be applied by the Central Bank.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Central Bank had consulted industry on the proposed 2015 levies which I understand would have in some cases amounted to a significant increase on 2014. The Bank attributed the proposed increase to both a proliferation of legislative regulation/regulatory activity and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 coupled with current low yields on the bond market.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has acknowledged the potential impact that the volatility of pension costs would have on individual levies and, as a consequence, it is considering the possibility of spreading current service pension costs over an extended period, thereby mitigating the impact on the proposed 2015 levies.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. The Government's priority is to ensure that the regulator is sufficiently resourced to fulfil its important role and staff costs (including pension costs) are a key component of this effective regulatory regime. This is something that I will be taking into consideration in my deliberations on this matter.</p></reply>

Calculated on this basis, general government expenditure rises to 44.4%. This is marginally below the EU average identified above and in the middle of the distribution of values for all EU countries.</p>  <p>  In terms of allocating the fiscal space available between expenditure and revenue, a careful balance must be struck between accommodating current expenditure pressures and encouraging growth in the economy over the medium term to ensure that the economy will be in a position to support future demographic pressures as they arise.</p>  <p>  I believe that the right balance can be achieved by allocating the available resources equally between expenditure on public services and tax measures to encourage economic growth. As part of the tax package, I intend to continue to make it more attractive to return to work, to stay in work and to ensure that work rewards individuals adequately. I plan to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners in the upcoming budget and subsequent budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space.</p></reply>

Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State, deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets. The Agency seeks to achieve this in every instance and, therefore, when a debtor "exits", NAMA will have determined that NAMA has fulfilled its requirements under Section 10 of the Act in securing the best achievable financial return for the State.</p>  <p>  In addition, I wish to advise the Deputy that the use of property-related tax breaks has been significantly curtailed in recent years. Section 17 of the Finance Act 2012 was enacted with the intention of reducing the legacy of property reliefs in line with Government policy to develop a fairer tax code. The provisions of section 17 (now contained in Chapter 4A of Part 12 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) apply to the various accelerated property and area-based capital allowance schemes. With effect from the beginning of 2015 any unused accelerated capital allowances, which are carried forward beyond the tax life of the expenditure on the building or structure to which they relate, are immediately lost. This essentially means that if the tax life has ended at any time up to the end of 2014, then the unused allowances are lost in 2015.  On the other hand if the tax life is due to end later than 2014, the allowances are lost after the end of the tax life of the expenditure. Additionally, these measures apply solely to passive investors. Persons who are actively engaged in their respective trades are not affected.</p>  <p>  By comparison to older property-related tax breaks, the Living City Initiative was constructed so that it would be available to owner-occupiers and not developers.</p>  <p>  Queries with regard to development levies are a matter for the relevant local authorities and my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly T.D.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the tax system cannot target specific taxpayers in the way that the Deputy is suggesting.</p></reply>

This represents more than &euro;566 million worth of works involving some 5,975 contractors. The potential total cost to the Exchequer in respect of these properties is approximately &euro;38.26m. The incentive generates employment in the tax compliant construction sector and provides support for homeowners and landlords for building works.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides tax relief by way of an income tax credit on the repair, renovation or improvement works on principal private residences or rental property carried out by tax compliant contractors. In addition to providing an income tax relief, the HRI also aims to support tax compliance in the building industry by moving activity out of the shadow economy into the legitimate economy.</p>  <p>  Seeing the success of the measure, and to provide some certainty to the sector, I have announced my intention to extend the HRI for a further year, until 31st December 2016. This will allow extra time for homeowners and landlords to make the necessary changes to their properties, and provide additional support to the construction sector for another year.</p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to a proposal to amend the scheme, I would point out that this is an income tax relief, not a grant, and therefore individuals who have no income tax liability will not be eligible for this incentive. In order to assist those who are only liable for small amounts of tax, the relief is granted over the two years following the year in which the contractor is paid for the work. Where the credit cannot be used in these two years due to insufficient income tax, then the relief may be carried forward to the following year and each subsequent year until the relief has been used in full.</p>  <p>  For individuals who do not have any income tax liability, such individuals may be able to avail of other incentive schemes such as those administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. For example, the SEAI operate cash grants for certain works under the Better Energy Homes Scheme. In addition, they operate the Warmer Homes Scheme, under which work such as attic insulation can be carried out free of charge to qualifying individuals.</p></reply>

Subject to these caveats, it is very tentatively estimated that the cost of introducing a &euro;5m cap and 15% CGT rate for individuals could cost in excess of &euro;100 million in a full year. This assumes that the reduced rate would apply in respect of all quoted and unquoted shares, commercial property disposals by proprietary directors and self-employed individuals and also agricultural land disposals by farmers. This estimate assumes no behavioural impact.</p></reply>

This comes on the back of an increase of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In the Spring Economic Statement, published in April of this year, my Department forecast that the economy would grow by 4 per cent in 2015 and 3.8 per cent in 2016. On the basis of strong quarterly national account results for the first and second quarters of this year, I expect these projections to be revised upwards in the macroeconomic forecasts which will be published with the Budget in mid-October. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up over 3 per cent in the first half of this year and investment up over 20 per cent. In fact, last year domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by almost 14 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had eleven successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that the economy can grow by around 3 per cent per annum on a sustainable basis.   However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon the implementation of the right policy mix. As set out in the Spring Economic Statement, the Government is using all policy instruments available to build sustainable public finances, improve access to credit and reform the income tax system. A carefully targeted capital investment plan will be used to alleviate supply side bottlenecks and barriers to growth. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which I established will also contribute in this regard.   The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements, wage and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved to continue to attract foreign direct and indigenous investment.</p>  <p>  In summary, I am confident that significant economic progress can be made in the years ahead. But crucially,  this is contingent upon implementing appropriate polices. That is what the Government intends to do. </p></reply>

Investors in project-specific bonds would require higher yields than standard Government bonds to reflect lower liquidity. Such project-specific bonds, if issued by Government, would also be on the Government's balance sheet.</p>  <p>  However in the case of a Public Private Partnership (PPP), where the State selects a private consortium to Design, Build, Finance &amp;amp; Operate State infrastructure, that private consortium can issue project-specific bonds. Such bond issuance may be deemed to be outside of General Government provided that the necessary risks are contractually transferred to the private sector in accordance with Eurostat rules. The latter type bonds are considered by investors to carry significantly more risk than standard Government issued bonds and consequently require higher yields to reflect the risk profile. </p>  <p>  I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the recently announced joint venture between the Irish Strategic Infrastructure Fund (ISIF) and KKR Credit. The joint venture, named  Activate Capital  will invest in the development and construction of housing, with &euro;500 million of financing, which will assist in normalising the sector and addressing the housing shortfall. The venture will be a &euro;500 million vehicle and will be financed through a &euro;325 million investment from the ISIF (its biggest single investment to date) and &euro;175 million investment from KKR. This is good news for jobs, growth, potential house purchasers, and the construction sector. This joint venture will be an important source of funding for increasing the supply of medium to large housing developments. </p></reply>

This commitment was delivered in Budgets 2012, 2013 and 2014, which was critical in ensuring that income tax did not act as an excessive impediment to the recovery.    </p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government has been very clear in relation to its tax policy intentions.  The Statement of Priorities issued by Government in July 2014, included a commitment for an income tax reform plan to be delivered over a number of budgets, to reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.   The first stage of the plan was given effect in Budget 2015, when a suite of Income Tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) measures were introduced.   These changes to the income tax system ensures that all those who paid income tax or USC in 2014 are seeing a reduction in their tax bill for 2015.   This marked the end of the consolidation period.   </p>  <p>  Finally, as I have stated many times in the house, it is intended that the fiscal space available in Budget 2016 will facilitate the continuation of this plan. </p></reply>

To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit facilities from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.</p><p>Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016, including lending to the SME sector.  My Department collates and examines, on a monthly basis, granular data on the funding of the activities of SMEs from both AIB and Bank of Ireland, the wider banking sector and increasingly the non-bank funding sector. In addition, AIB and Bank of Ireland meet my officials on a quarterly basis to keep them abreast of issues pertaining to the SME sector. This facilitates the Department and the Credit Review Office in monitoring progress against agreed annual SME lending plans and ensuring that new lending to SMEs continues to increase as a percentage of total sanctioned lending.I will keep this area under close scrutiny to ensure that the SME sector can access an adequate flow of credit to support the recovery of the economy.</p><p>The SME State Bodies Group chaired by my Department are responsible for the Finance for Growth commitments in Action Plan for Jobs.  In 2014, there was strong emphasis on broadening the range of bank and non-bank finance mechanisms available to SMEs.  The APJ 2014 included an integrated action plan that included a series of measures designed to;</p><p>- Increase new lending </p><p>- Increase participation in Government sponsored initiatives</p><p>- Develop new sources of funding</p><p>- Increase awareness of Government measures and initiatives to support SMES and </p><p>- Enhance the financial capability of SMEs.</p><p>In seeking to build on the progress to date and to maximise the benefits to SMEs of the evolving financial landscape in Ireland the focus in 2015 has been to implement a series of actions in the following areas:</p><p>- Support and influence the effective implementation of major policy initiatives to ensure that the maximum benefits are afforded to SMES</p><p>- Continue to raise awareness and understanding amongst SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full suite of State business supports that are available</p><p>- Ensure that the LEO network is a key conduit in providing information, support and advice to small businesses on access to finance issues and strengthen the linkages between enterprise capacity building, accessing finance and business guidance</p><p>- Deepen our engagement with international funding institutions</p><p>- Facilitate and support the development of a more diverse range of financing options for SMEs</p><p>The Government's aim for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is for it to enhance the range and profile of SME finance providers in Ireland. The SBCI has been established to last into the long term and has been mandated to consider the needs of the SME sector in particular in all of its affairs. Already the SBCI's partnership with AIB has resulted in a 2% reduction in that bank's standard interest rate offering to SMEs.From 9 March to the end of June, some &euro;44.6 million across 1,626 SBCI loans have been extended to the SME market.</p><p>The average loan size is &euro;27,500.  The SBCI will continue to work with existing and new providers to develop specific funding products for the needs of SMEs and will also support new entrants to the SME funding markets so as to increase competition and enhance choice. The SBCI is currently in discussions with other banks and a number of non-bank providers of finance to provide products such as invoice discounting, leasing and asset based finance in order to broaden the funding options available to the SME sector and to support those providers with SBCI monies.</p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund. This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness.</p><p>The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer, John Trethowan and his team, have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.  Further details are available at .  </p><p>The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently the Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit with a view to taking appropriate actions as warranted to ensure that SMEs in Ireland have the opportunity to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation. </p></reply>

The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.  </p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at .  Among the key findings of the review was that while fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years, net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their European peers. </p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers. The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) also lists the various charges imposed by financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions .  The revised Payment Services Directive (known as PSD2) is currently being finalised at EU level and it is expected that Member States will be required to transpose the Directive by 2017. Among its other objectives, PSD2 is expected to promote competition, meaning increased choice and better conditions for consumers and businesses.</p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking. Individuals' use of their bank account will be specific to each individual and I would strongly encourage people to look at this comparison site with their specific circumstances in mind in order to decide which institution offers the best product for their pattern of account usage. </p><p>On interest rates, Central Bank data contained in the Retail Interest Rates Statistical Release show that the rate on new floating rate loan agreements for house purchase (which includes renegotiations), was 3.35 per cent at end-July 2015, representing a decrease of 3 basis points over the month. The equivalent euro rate was 2.04 per cent.  The Deputy will be aware of the actions that I have taken in this area recently and that themajority of the lenders have now put options in place to allow borrowers to reduce their monthly repayments.</p></reply>

This is important for both our economy and the ongoing development of excellent relations between Ireland and the UK. It is the Government's stated position as well that the EU itself is stronger and more effective with the UK as a member.</p>  <p>  The UK's continuing membership within the Union is therefore a strategic objective for the Government.  We are accordingly monitoring developments in the relationship between the UK and the EU very carefully in order to best understand the different interests at stake.  </p>  <p>  My Department is focusing, in particular, on the economic and financial issues involved. In this regard, the ESRI has undertaken research, under the Department of Finance/ESRI research programme agreement, on the macroeconomic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of joint membership of the EU. This includes trade and investment aspects of our relationship, including financial services.  The research will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The UK Government is now committed to holding a referendum on its membership of the Union before the end of 2017 and we fully respect that this is an issue for the British electorate to decide.  However, our hope is that they will vote to remain in the European Union. The Government intends to play a constructive role when it comes to negotiations within the EU on the terms of British membership. We will support any reasonable proposals for reform of the functioning of the Union, while at the same time making clear where we believe that specific proposals are undesirable or unachievable. </p></reply>

The level of undisputed debt (excluding appeals) is the lowest among OECD countries, having fallen from 3.7% of net collection in 2011 to 2.1% in 2014.  The cost of tax administration in Ireland, estimated at 0.85% of collection, is in the mid range of OECD countries.  Compliance measures also place Ireland among the best performers internationally.</p>  <p>  There is no indication that the Revenue Commissioners are generally under-resourced, or that a general increase in staffing would improve upon already excellent results.  Revenue however needs additional resources from time to time to address shortfalls in skill and numbers in particular areas, to improve the efficiency of administration, or to support targeted initiatives to tackle evasion.  Such issues are dealt with in the normal manner in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and proposed initiatives are included in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2014, which lists a range of possible savings and compliance improvements along with their associated costs of implementation.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the need to maintain the capacity of Revenue at the highest levels, and to that end the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was able to provide significant additional resources in 2015 in the areas of information technology, increased audit and compliance staffing, and specialist skills in international taxation and data analytics. </p>  <p>  In the event that the Revenue Commissioners make specific proposals in the future for additional resources to tackle non-compliance and tax evasion, any such proposal will be considered by me and by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

NAMA has a well-established overriding commercial  mandate to recoup the best return for the Irish taxpayer and this has not changed. However, that does not mean that NAMA does not carry out objectives, such as facilitating the delivery of residential and social housing, which are entirely consistent with its existing purpose and objectives.</p>  <p>  At the outset, it is important to note that NAMA does not build houses itself, rather it works with its existing debtors to agree development plans, secure/alter planning permission and fund the debtor's delivery of units.  Through these efforts NAMA are helping to increase the value of the security supporting the loans of its debtors and so improving NAMA's ultimate recovery on these loans.</p>  <p>  In this regard, NAMA continues to work closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State for Housing and Planning in relation to the delivery of residential housing, including social housing, and all parties are committed to the maximum possible delivery of residential units.  </p>  <p>  As at mid-September 2015, I am advised that NAMA had identified over 6,500 residential properties as potentially suitable for social housing.  I am further advised that demand has been confirmed by local authorities for over 2,500 properties, of which 1,518 have been delivered for social housing use. NAMA also expects the end 2015 target of 2,000 social housing units will be achieved.</p>  <p>  The 6,500 residential properties made available by NAMA for social housing represents the totality of vacant residential properties within NAMA's portfolio that were potentially suitable for social housing.  The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market and in that way have contributed to increased market supply. </p>  <p>  NAMA has no role in terms of determining the take-up of properties that it has made available for social housing as this is a matter for local authorities. The remaining properties made available by NAMA were ultimately deemed unsuitable by local authorities based on criteria such as their location and on wider planning and housing policy considerations or they were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers during the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm their suitability. </p>  <p>  All applicants for residential development, irrespective of who the funder is, must comply with the relevant planning and housing policy, including Part V policy relating to the provision of social housing which the Deputy referenced. As Minister for Finance, I do not have role in relation to the application of the Part V policy in respect of any individual development. </p>  <p>  NAMA has indicated that Part V units within new residential developments funded by it could be delivered through its social housing SPV, NARPS.  This would mean that the upfront capital cost of constructing such units would be borne by NAMA.  This may reduce the funding burden otherwise placed on financially constrained local authorities.  These units then could be leased under long term leasing arrangements for social housing.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, NAMA is also playing a key role in providing support to the wider residential market by boosting supply. With exposure to less than one-third of Dublin's residential development land, NAMA funding delivered 40% of the 3,259 new housing units in Dublin in 2014 and in the first half of 2015 funded the delivery of 50% of new output in Dublin.</p>  <p>  As a member of the Dublin Housing Task Force, NAMA has identified all the Tier 1 lands (i.e. sites with potential to deliver more than 20 units) on its books with residential planning already in place.  These, along with all other non-NAMA Tier 1 sites in the Dublin area, have been published via an interactive map on the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government website. This action has brought greater transparency to the Dublin market by publically providing detailed information on sites with development potential.</p>  <p>  In April 2014, as part of its contribution to address emerging residential supply shortages in the Greater Dublin area, NAMA established a dedicated Residential Delivery team to coordinate and drive the delivery of this commitment and assess the potential for delivery of additional units thereafter.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that NAMA also has security over 156 or 17% of the 992 unfinished housing estates in the country   down from 268 of 1,258 at end 2013. This substantial reduction in the number of unfinished housing estates within the NAMA portfolio reflects the impact of funding to debtors and receivers to undertake remedial works in line with Site Resolution Plans agreed with local authorities. NAMA also inform me that the Agency has advanced funding in excess of &euro;5m for site resolution works on unfinished housing estates in which it has an interest as a secured lender.</p>  <p>  With all of the above in mind, it is clear that NAMA is making a significant contribution to social and residential housing and a re-purposing of the Agency is not required in order for this to continue.</p></reply>

However, the position has always been that following the completion of their term of appointment, if any Secretary-General is employed elsewhere in the Public Service, the general rules of abatement apply to their pension. This means that pension is abated so that the rate of pension, when added to the rate of pay or fee for the subsequent work, will not exceed their former rate of salary uprated to current values. This position was reinforced when I reviewed the TLAC terms in October 2011 and the effects of abatement were further extended by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 to cover all public servants regardless of where in the Public Service they were re-employed.</p></reply>

The Equality Tribunal has jurisdiction to investigate and decide upon complaints of discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts and the Pensions Acts. The Equality Tribunal also provides a statutory mediation service.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that the average waiting time for a hearing of a complaint under the Employment Equality Acts is currently approx. 12 months. However, in cases where the complainant and respondent opt for mediation, a mediation hearing is arranged within approx. twelve weeks of the initial lodgement of the complaint. </p>  <p>  The Equality Tribunal has recently been endeavouring to put measures in place in order to reduce the current waiting time for a hearing. These measures include the training and appointment of a number of Rights Commissioners and persons from the external panel of WRC Adjudication Officers as temporary Equality Officers.  These measures have resulted in the reduction of the waiting time for a hearing in equality cases from 22 months in May, 2015 to 12 months at end September, 2015.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the Equality Tribunal to reduce backlogs and waiting times for hearings, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable. This is one of the reasons why I am implementing a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. </p>  <p>  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost-effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.</p>  <p>  From 1 October, 2015, a new two-tier Workplace Relations structure will be established comprising two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five (i.e. the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court). We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p>  <p>  The WRC Adjudication Officers will comprise a diverse panel of adjudicators which will include experienced industrial relations and HR practitioners, employment lawyers and civil servants with appropriate skills/qualifications. This will include the current cohort of Rights Commissioners and Equality Officers along with an externally recruited panel of suitably qualified and experienced persons. The 19 Adjudication Officers, selected for appointment following an open competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service in December last year, have undergone intensive training and are now available for assignment. These Adjudicators, together with the pre-Establishment Day cohort of Equality Officers and Rights Commissioners who have been appointed as WRC adjudicators, will be working to provide efficient and effective adjudication on complaints and disputes. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the waiting time for a hearing under the equality legislation will be reduced by a further three months by the end of 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.533.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900061#WRK02600"><p>The Action Plan for Jobs is having a positive impact on employment in the economy, since the first Plan was launched in early 2012. As of Q2 2015, there were an additional 126,000 at work in the economy since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs, which achieved and exceeded the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 extra at work by 2016. The services sector made the largest contribution to the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s target of 100,000 more at work. Following a number of years of decline in employment from 2007, I am pleased to report that the manufacturing sector has also recorded increases in job numbers since 2011. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made by Government in supporting job creation and in reducing unemployment rates in all regions of the country, including Dublin. By Q2 2015 the number at work in Dublin had risen to 591,800, an additional 88,000 from Q1 2012. As of Q2 2015 the unemployment rate in Dublin was down to 8.1% from 13.1% in early 2012. The number of unemployed in Dublin has reduced from 75,800 in early 2012 to 51,800 in Q2 2015 according to the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey. </p>  <p>  While progress has been made, this Government is not complacent about the challenge of achieving sustainable full employment over the medium term, in all regions including Dublin. As part of the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs we launched the process for developing Action Plans for every region and the work on the preparation of the Dublin Action Plan for Jobs is currently commencing. Two areas of particular focus will be how we can generate future entrepreneurship and investment in manufacturing and services sectors of the economy.  </p>  <p>  Arising from the strategy for the manufacturing sector &lsquo;Making it in Ireland: Manufacturing 2020&rsquo;, prepared by Forf&aacute;s and the report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs Skills Report on the skills needs for the sector, both of which I launched in 2013, there are now a range of initiatives being progressed by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the Government&rsquo;s jobs targets. In recent weeks I launched a new guide for manufacturing enterprises on the supports available through the state bodies and agencies to support new and existing employment. </p>  <p>  Manufacturing was a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and is a key focus in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs and also in the regional Action Plans for Jobs, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting indigenous companies and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative. The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations. These initiatives are important to growing and sustaining the competitiveness of existing enterprises, to sustaining employment and to attracting new investment. </p>  <p>  For both manufacturing and services sectors, skills and talent development and attraction are critically important. We have a good skills base on which to grow our manufacturing and services sectors and as the economy recovers there will be further opportunities for the unemployed. My Department and its agencies has a Protocol in place with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that where new job openings are available, that there is an efficient and timely matching between those unemployed and skills required by enterprise and that appropriate training or development is available. The Apprenticeship Council has also recently announced a number of new apprenticeships to meet the current and future skills needs of manufacturing and services sectors. These new apprenticeships will also provide a range of opportunities for the long terms and youth unemployed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.536.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900061#WRK02800"><p>The games sector experienced considerable growth in Ireland in recent years, with many of the sector&rsquo;s largest global players having established operations in Ireland. The games sector in Ireland encompasses a broad breadth of areas for example the Irish operations of Activision and Culture Translate demonstrate the capabilities that exist in games localisation.  The indigenous game studios demonstrate the games development, platform development/porting capabilities in Ireland (e.g. Digit, Six Minute Games).  The strengths in technology development/middleware are evidenced by Havok (Intel), Swrve, and DemonWare (ActivisionBlizzard).  The operations of Riot, Webzen, and Red5Studios highlight the broader publishing capabilities here.  And, the customer service &amp;amp; community management activities in EA, Blizzard, Riot and Zynga demonstrate the ability of Ireland to support multilingual, pan-European, high end customer support activities.Ireland has produced exciting start-up companies some of which have had a major impact within the global industry, including Havok (Intel) and Demonware (ActivisionBlizzard) and Ireland continues to have a hotbed of very early stage start-ups and independent games designers, with new entrants every year.</p><p>Tracking of employment in the games industry and related activities is difficult to assess definitively due to data classification limitations in official statistics, and also the small scale of many of the independent Irish owned operations. Analysis undertaken by Forf&aacute;s in 2011 estimated that total employment in the sector stood at around 2,200 having experienced a five-fold increase from a low base of an estimated 400 in 2004. This was driven mainly by rapid growth in foreign direct investment in the sector over the period, particularly in activities such as customer and technical support, community management and games localisation.</p><p>In tandem with this growth, there has also been considerable expansion within the broader consumer internet sector (including social media and mobile internet) to which a large part of the games industry is inextricably linked. Ireland now has a very strong Internet and social networking cluster in existence &ndash; thanks to significant investments in EMEA Operations Centres from leading companies such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, eBay, PayPal, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, etc. A wider base of related activities can also be considered part of the games ecosystem, although it is difficult to assess the degree to which these are connected to the industry in Ireland; these activities include: software development, financial services, online gambling, information security, animation &amp;amp; film production, and creative arts (music, art, literature).</p><p>The talent base associated with this broad range of activities is a significant attractiveness factor in new games sector enterprise investments. Ireland also possesses a long history and tradition in technical and creative content development, through our innate storytelling abilities seen through the success of our animation industry to the international recognition of Ireland today as a centre of excellence for technology investment. Investment in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband/internet infrastructures also has had a strong role to play in underpinning new activity in the games sector in recent years.</p><p>Since 2011, there have been a number of new investments by foreign owned games companies, the most recent being Kama Games, a global developer and publisher of social games for mobile platforms which is headquartered in Dublin who announced an expansion of up to 100 jobs over the next 3 years (announced July 2015).  Others have departed the scene (such as Big Fish and PopCap) reflective of the ongoing disruptive competitive forces within the games sector globally.</p><p>The Irish owned element of the Irish games cluster is still relatively young by international standards but its reputation is growing and awareness within the investor community to the attractiveness of the Irish games sector is increasing. A number of Irish games startups (in middleware and content) have raised seed and follow on series &lsquo;A&rsquo; funding investments over the last 24 months. Current exports from the Irish owned segment account for over 95 percent of their turnover and are oriented towards the UK and North American markets in the main. Linkages with international games publishers are key to the growth of the games content developers. The marketing of games is very expensive and publishers have the monies and users to enable a small Irish company create a hit game.</p><p>CEOs are collaborating in a structured way to grow the cluster to the next stage of international growth through industry representative groups such as Games Ireland. Indigenous indie developers have recently set up a new representative body called &lsquo;Imirt&rsquo;  ().</p><p>Subsequent to the publication of the Forf&aacute;s Report on the sector in 2011 (The Games Sector in Ireland: An Action Plan for Growth), Minister Bruton, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2012, established a Clustering Development Team (CDT) for the Games Sector on 25 July 2012 to support the implementation of actions called for in the Report.  This industry-chaired group comprised representatives of leading Irish and multinational games companies based in Ireland, as well as representatives of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Forf&aacute;s, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S, HEA and the Higher Education Institutes/Colleges of Further Education.</p><p>The ambitions for the CDT are to drive &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; collaboration and networking by proactively developing relationships between the foreign and indigenous cohort of games companies, HEIs and related sectors along with seeking to influence the policy system. The CDT  provides a forum for discussion of issues for industry, enterprise support agencies, the education system and policy Departments.</p><p>A series of specific actions set out in the Action Plans for Jobs have been delivered on since the establishment of the CDT. These included activities in order to heighten awareness within the sector of the existing R&amp;amp;D supports available to the Games sector. The enterprise agencies held a number of R&amp;amp;D supports workshops and issued an enterprise friendly guide on R&amp;amp;D tax credits which included examples of relevance to games companies. The Department worked with the industry members of the group to assess the case for introducing a new specific financial instrument/relief for the Games industry and in 2014, a proposal was made to the Department of Finance for the introduction of a refundable corporation tax credit for the games sector, along the lines of what has been introduced in the UK and France.</p><p>A further key area of activity for the group has been to promote the increase in collaboration between industry and HEIs/Training providers in terms of mentoring and course content.  A pilot &ldquo;hothouse&rdquo; initiative for undergraduate and Post-Leaving Certificate courses was devised and run in late 2013, which saw students from games, animation and multimedia courses working in multi-disciplinary teams on projects supported by an industry mentor.</p><p>In order to promote industry engagement with the development of curriculum of games courses, a leading games expert visited Ireland for six weeks in September and October 2014 as part of a Fulbright U.S. Specialist Award in conjunction with the HEA and carried out master classes and curriculum reviews of Digital Games courses at a number of Irish universities and colleges. She also met with industry representatives and government agencies and had very constructive meetings with Minister English in respect of enterprise and Minister O&rsquo;Sullivan in respect of education.</p><p>My Department continues to support the Games sector through the enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. As with other companies in the technology and creative sectors, games companies can avail of the direct supports provided by the enterprise agencies such as the Competitive Start Fund, Seed Capital, In-market and Management development, R&amp;amp;D funding and tailored company expansion packages. A range of financial instruments also exists to assist companies which are not sector specific.</p><p>A number of the existing venture funds have and will continue to invest in a range of Irish owned software related projects including businesses in the digital game space (Seed and later stage). Enterprise Ireland (EI) has also co invested. EI&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50k equity) has also had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has funded over 20 Games companies to date. The companies include Batcat Games, Bitsmith, Redwind, Tribal City and Gone Gaming. R&amp;amp;D support is available for companies as they mature to cash generating businesses. The cohort has also availed of a number of start-up management development programmes to date (including iGap&amp;amp; Sprint).</p><p>At the request of Government I am currently finalising a new Enterprise Policy 2025 strategy, which will identify a number of sectors/activities with future growth potential. The creative sector is one such example, of which the games industry is a part and we will work to ensure the employment growth potential of the sector is realised.</p></reply>

The frequency and ferocity of these storm events, compounded by waterlogged soils on many forest sites, led to extensive damage on both private and State owned forest lands. While estimates indicate that less than 1% of the national forest area (approximately 8,000 hectares) has been blown down, the damage has been extensive at a local level, especially in the south and parts of the midlands where substantial quantities of timber have been blown down.  Financial support for reinstating privately owned forests affected by the winter storms of 2013/2014 is currently being considered by the Department. A final decision on this matter can be expected shortly.   </p></reply>

The Turf Club have advised that in the case of one horse there was evidence of skin disease and soreness and in the case of the other animal there was also an issue with soreness.  My Department has authorised the Turf Club under the Animal Health and Welfare Act and signed a service level agreement with that body to ensure the protection of horses under that Act.     </p>  <p>  The incidents concerned were not reported to my Department. There is no obligation or expectation that the Turf Club would report individual issues to the Department (e. g. overuse of the whip, a horse withdrawn because it is lame at a pre-race inspection) that are dealt with by the body themselves. The reporting relationship with the Turf Club and other bodies dealing with the implementation and monitoring of welfare issues is   in the form of annual reviews &amp;amp; reports. In the event that the Turf Club uncover very serious welfare issues with broader repercussions then it is expected that these would be reported to the Department. </p>  <p>  The Turf Club carries out an audit programme covering all aspects of compliance with the Rules of Racing (including animal welfare). I understand that they randomly inspect in the region of 100 trainers premises per annum as well as carrying out pre-race inspections during summer months. Specific premises are inspected where there is evidence to target such a premises   and history of previous non-compliance with the rules of racing may be considered in this regard. During the inspection I understand the Turf Club identify all horses and check their condition. All adverse findings are included in the audit report. </p></reply>

The Programme is co-funded by the EU&rsquo;s European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the national exchequer.  EU support for the RDP via the EAFRD will average &euro;313 million annually, or an aggregate sum of &euro;2.19 billion over the 7-year Programme lifespan.  This EU funding will be supplemented by exchequer funding. The allocation of funding will be phased over the Programme period in line with the requirements of measure design.</p><p>EAFRD and national funding over the RDP</p><p>The RDP is structured on the regulatory framework set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1305/2013 and other supporting legislation.  This framework is based on the concept of measures, rather than individual schemes and the financial plan for the RDP is of necessity also based on this measure structure. The overall allocations between measures are set out in the table below.</p><p><b>EAFRD and national funding over the RDP lifetime</b><table><tr><th>Measure </th><th>&euro; millions </th></tr><tr><td>Measure 1 - Knowledge transfer and information actions <br /><br />Of which<br /><br />- &euro;100m Knowledge Transfer Groups<br /><br />- &euro;14m for training to be delivered as part of BDGP<br /><br />- &euro;12m for training to be delivered as part of GLAS </td><td>126 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 2 - Advisory services, farm management and farm relief services <br /><br />Of which<br /><br />- &euro;2m for CPD for advisors<br /><br />- &euro;6m for animal health advisory services </td><td>8 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 4 - Investments in physical assets<br /><br />- Of which &euro;395m is in respect of TAMSII, with the remainder for TAMSI transitional funding </td><td>425 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 7 - Basic services and village renewal in rural areas<br /><br />- This is in effect part of GLAS </td><td>6 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 10 - Agri-environment-climate<br /><br />- See below in relation to detail on Measure 10 breakdown, including transitional expenditure </td><td>1,585 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 11 - Organic farming </td><td>56 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 13 - Payments to areas facing natural/other specific constraints </td><td>1,370 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 16 - Co-operation<br /><br />- Of which &euro;3m for support for collaborative farming<br /><br />- &euro;4m for European Innovation Partnerships </td><td>7 </td></tr><tr><td>Measure 19 - Support for LEADER local development </td><td>250 </td></tr></table>Transitional arrangements have been put in place for expenditure spanning the programming periods of the 2007-2013 RDP and the 2014-2020 RDP.  Transitional funding is included in the figures above in respect of Measures 4, 10 and 13.  In addition to the above figures, the RDP financial plan also includes transitional funding allocated to measures from the 2007-2013 RDP which do not have a corresponding measure in the 2014-2020 RDP.</p><p>In certain instances, the measure structure is the same as our national scheme structure.  For example, Measure 13 relates to the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme and in both instances the financial allocation over the lifetime of the RDP is the same &ndash; i.e. &euro;1,370m.  This is also the situation with regard to Measure 11 - Organic Farming, &euro;56m.</p><p>However, in other cases the Measure and Scheme structure do not correspond directly.  For example, Measure 10 includes expenditure on our two Measure 10 schemes GLAS and BDGP.  However, there is also BDGP and GLAS expenditure in Measure 1 for the training elements to be delivered as part of these schemes at the national level.</p><p>Measure 10 includes &euro;280m for BDGP which is then complemented by the allocation for BDGP training which is contained in Measure 1.  The total expenditure envisaged for GLAS (Measure 10) over the lifetime of the scheme is &euro;1.4bn<font color="#1F497D">.</font>This includes an allocation of some &euro;390m in transitional funding for remaining commitments arising from the Agri-Environment Measures in the 2007-2013 RDP, much of which may transfer directly to GLAS expenditure as these farmers &lsquo;transform&rsquo; their existing contracts into new GLAS contracts.<font color="#1F497D"> </font>In order to ensure that the planned level of commitments under Measure 10 is achieved, the expenditure includes the arrangement that commitments which extend beyond the 2014-2020 period (for example GLAS contracts which commence in 2017 or later) can be funded from the transitional arrangements which will be in place for that programming period.  This is a standard feature of RDP financing.</p><p>As Measures have been rolled out over the last few months, the only outlay to date has been in respect of transitional commitments and the recent announcement in relation to the first tranche of ANC payments.</p></reply>

In order to clarify the position regarding the area of any ineligible features my Department arranged for a ground verification check to be undertaken.  This check confirmed the 2013 area over-declaration as 90.26% in the case of both the Single Farm Payment and the Disadvantaged Area Schemes.  As the over-declaration was greater than 20% of the newly established eligible area in respect of both Schemes, no payment is due to the person named under the 2013 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.594.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900062#WRL04900"><p>Under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme Knowledge Transfer groups across a range of sectors, including beef, dairy and sheep, will be established.  The design of the measure has been informed by experience from previous discussion groups, extensive stakeholder consultation and the relevant articles from the respective EU regulations.  Participants are required to attend Knowledge Transfer (KT) group meetings and complete a Farm Improvement Plan.  I believe that the combination of both farmer knowledge exchange meetings and one to one interaction between the farmer and advisor in the development of a Farm Improvement Plan will ensure the transfer and exchange of information and best practice to participating farmers.  The analysis of previous discussion group schemes and consultations leading up to the design of the KT Programme highlighted the importance of addressing all aspects of a farming enterprise including profitability, environmental sustainability, farm safety and animal health and welfare measures.  This is reflected in the scheme design which includes the requirement for a private veterinary practitioner (PVP) to oversee the preparation of an individual animal health and welfare plan.  While a payment to cover the PVP&rsquo;s involvement is not an eligible cost under the relevant article covering knowledge transfer, the time spent by the farmer in completing the Animal Health Measure aspect of the Farm Improvement Plan is and has been included in the total payment to participating farmers.  Over the period of the programme this totals &euro;160. In effect this reduces the PVP cost over the period of the programme by &euro;160, thereby significantly reducing the net PVP cost.</p>  <p>  Participation in more than one Knowledge Transfer group across sectors is not permitted.  This is largely due to potential double funding which would arise from the completion of more than one Farm Improvement Plan for a single farming enterprise.  I am however considering how farmers could participate in KT groups across two sectors, while at the same time avoiding double funding issues.</p>  <p>  An appropriate named nominee will be allowed to attend in the place of a farmer participating in Knowledge Transfer.</p>  <p>  Under the relevant article covering knowledge transfer the knowledge transfer facilitator is the beneficiary and all payments under this measure must issue to him/her in the first instance.  There is no leeway in this regard.  A robust payment procedure is being developed which will make the facilitator payment contingent on provision of confirmation that the payment has issued to his group participants, thereby ensuring timely payment to all participating farmers.</p></reply>

The General Scheme is focused on improving the protections that are available to those who are at greatest risk of domestic violence.  These are spouses, civil partners and those cohabiting in an intimate and committed relationship, parents and persons who have had a child together.  The protections also extend to dependents who are under 18 or under 23, if in full-time education, or who have a physical or intellectual disability which prevents them from living independently.  The legislation thus extends to quite a wide range of family relationships.  It is not proposed at this stage to extend the definition further as criminal law mechanisms are available for use by other categories of relatives.</p></reply>

The Working Group was chaired by former High Court Judge, Dr. Brian McMahon, and its membership was drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations, protection applicants, academia and relevant Government Departments and Offices.</p><p>The Report of the Working Group which was published on 30 June 2015, contains 173 recommendations many of which have implications for a number of Government Departments and services.</p><p>The Report identifies the excessive length of time in the protection system as the most significant issue facing those in Direct Provision.  I am committed to tackling the lengthy delays in the protection system.  A number of initiatives have already been taken to deal with the number of cases on hand including the scheduling of interviews of applicants on Saturdays, the transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the establishment of a legal panel to assist the Commissioner with this work, and the appointment of additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>The Government has decided to bring forward as a major priority the International Protection Bill which will provide for the introduction of a single applications procedure for international protection.  This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the Direct Provision system.</p><p>Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996 provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application. The Report of the Working Group<b>, </b>acknowledging government policy in this area, does not recommend any immediate right to work<b>. </b>It does, however<b>, </b>include a recommendation to provide for access to the labour market for certain protection applicants when the single procedure is operating efficiently.</p><p>The Government in its decision of the 30 June 2015 recommended that the Report of the Working Group should in the first instance be the subject of a detailed discussion at the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The Committee agreed that my Department should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the legal, financial and practical implications of the Report's recommendations.</p><p>Each Department is currently examining the recommendations to determine timescales for implementation and any impacts and issues that may arise.  My Department will be working with the other relevant Departments on an overall response in the coming weeks.</p><p>The Cabinet Committee also decided that the Minister of State for New Communities, Culture and Equality convene a Taskforce, as recommended in the Report, to examine the mechanisms and supports for the transitioning of persons granted status from the Direct Provision system.  The work of the Taskforce is key as it is essential that persons who are granted status are supported in transitioning out of the Direct Provision system and thus do not spend any longer than is necessary in the system once a positive decision on their case has been made. The Taskforce has met on a number of occasions and has progressed a number of matters including the sourcing of appropriate accommodation in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the production of an information pack on the range of services and supports that are available for those in the system with status and the rolling out of a Pilot Information Programme for persons granted status in a number of areas throughout the country.</p></reply>

This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.

Instances of crime and anti-social behaviour are monitored by local Garda management with the assistance of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service, which results in periodic operations aimed at anti-social behaviour on and around public transport routes.  I am further advised that there is effective communication with the respective control centres and that access to good quality CCTV has also been of great assistance in the investigation of complaints.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the above, I have no plans to establish a separate transport police service for the Dublin area and investment is instead being made in enhancing the resources available for policing generally.  As the Deputy will be aware, the resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; is a key component in improving public safety throughout the country and the increased resources which are now coming on stream will undoubtedly benefit policing in relation to transport services in Dublin and in other areas.</p></reply>

I have carried out a broad and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries, including a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.</p>  <p>  On foot of this review, I published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015, which is before the Houses of the Oireachtas this week.  The Bill targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who are responsible for a great number of burglaries and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others. I hope to have this new legislation enacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Insofar as the specific policing measures in place to tackle burglary are concerned, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.  This sustained Garda campaign against burglary, which incorporates burglary related Operations in each Garda Division has resulted in many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminality. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 charges being brought against suspects.</p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the policing response is as effective as can be and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.  In this regard, I have made specific funding available for new specialised vehicles and technology  to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly-mobile gangs.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are key components in providing well resourced and visible policing throughout the country and supporting enhanced community safety. Between September 2014 and the end of this year 550 new recruits will have entered the Garda College in Templemore, and the Government remains committed to ongoing recruitment in 2016, providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.</p></reply>

Most of these reforms had already been signalled the previous September in a joint statement by the Minister for Education and Science and myself.  A key element is the implementation of the International List of Educational Providers (ILEP) to replace the International Register on a phased basis during 2015.</p>  <p>  Applications for inclusion on the ILEP from all private providers, including those providing English Language Programmes, will be assessed against a range of criteria, for example; the transparency of ownership, standards of governance, learner protection and the operation and quality of the educational product.  The educational criteria, in particular, will look at the learning environment, teaching and learning supports and the learning contents and outcomes.  In addition unannounced on-site inspections of providers will be conducted during the application phase and afterwards to ensure that providers remain fully compliant with the criteria for inclusion on the ILEP.  All of theses requirements are set out in detail in the Government Policy Statement and the Guidelines for English Language and Higher Education and Professional Programmes on the website of the Irish naturalisation and Immigration service website (www.inis.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  There will be an appeals process available to providers in respect of adverse decisions.  This will involve a more senior official reviewing the initial finding and will include an opportunity for the provider to provide additional material in support of their appeal.  Appeals will be accepted within five working days of the applicant receiving the initial decision.</p>  <p>  As with any new process it will take some time to bed down and there have been some gaps in the information provided in the majority of applications and this is being addressed with the providers on an ongoing basis.  The overall process is generally taking somewhat longer than anticipated.  As a result the next phase of the reforms intended for 1 October 2015, and in particular the publication of an updated ILEP will be delayed for a number of weeks.  Providers have been informed.   A new date will be notified shortly.    </p></reply>

The specific policing measures to be taken in this regard are, of course, a matter for the Garda authorities.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responding to the incidence of burglary in the Dublin area through Operation Acer, which is in force throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region. This includes a particular focus on identifying and targeting criminal groups involved in this criminality. Burglary Response Units attached to each Division, including DMR North,  take the lead in Operation Acer and are assisted by other units as required. In addition, a further and related operation, Operation Creeper, assists in the surveillance of Acer targets by monitoring their movements and this Operation has been tasked solely with targeting burglary suspects which has resulted in the successful arrests of Acer targets. These Operations are all coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.</p>  <p>  I am assured that local Garda Management closely monitors the deployment of resources, patrols and operational strategies in place for the area concerned, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.

I have also made specific funding available for new specialised vehicles and technology  to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly-mobile gangs. The increased resources which are now coming on stream will undoubtedly support enhanced policing and community safety in all areas.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda response to burglary crime, the Deputy will also be aware that I recently published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015 and that this legislation is before the Houses of the Oireachtas this week.  The Bill targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending. The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who are responsible for a great number of burglaries and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others. I hope to have this new legislation enacted as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The Committee agreed that my Department should prepare a report for the Cabinet Committee, in conjunction with relevant Departments, on the legal financial and practical implications of the Report's recommendations.

The closure of B Wing effectively halved the number of prisoners who do not have in cell sanitation in Limerick Prison.</p><p>The IPS capital programme has also identified the replacement of B Wing as a priority and plans are being advanced in this regard. In January 2015 the Irish Prison Service secured the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure Reform to advance plans for a major development at Limerick Prison to tender stage.</p><p>The development includes a modern 150 cell block and a new facility there for up to 58 female prisoners.

A significant innovation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 was the introduction of a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality in their work and conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights.  The Commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice. This means the systematic integration of an equality and human right perspective into everyday work, including changes to organisational cultures so that such a perspective is an integral part of the organisation.   This innovation puts the promotion and protection of human rights at the heart of our domestic and foreign policies, and as the Deputy is aware, our Constitution places strong emphasis on fundamental rights and predates both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  We have in place a range of human rights action plans or strategies targeted at specific groups. We have sectoral strategies in place to safeguard, promote and further the rights of groups or sectors within society, such as people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma, older people, migrants, and carers, for example.  We also have strategies in place to promote gender equality, tackle domestic and sexual-based violence, and promote social inclusion.  As human rights and equality issues cross the whole of Government, the Cabinet Committee system plays an important role in ensuring coordination and a holistic approach on relevant issues.  Our current system of focusing our energies on specific sectoral approaches allows us to respond with agility to suggestions emerging from our ongoing working relationship and consultations with civil society; a good example of this would be the proposals for an LGBTI strategy or roadmap which I announced in recent days.</p>  <p>  I am open to the idea of a developing a National Action Plan on Human Rights, if it were clear that a such general, overarching plan would bring added value to the considerable work already being undertaken.  However, I do remain to be convinced that such a National Plan would be the best way forward in terms of making the best use of the resources available to me and the most practical and effective way of partnering with specific civil society sectoral interests.  However, I am happy to keep the question under review and to promote continued discussion on this suggestion with IHREC, civil society and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.</p>  <p>  The process of the Independent Review has not been to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation designed to make findings. Its purpose has been to triage the allegations to see if further investigations are needed.</p>  <p>  The review of each complaint consisted of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a counsel from the Panel.  Documentation held by the Department, or forwarded by the Department of the Taoiseach, on each case was referred to the Panel. Such documentation would include correspondence from complainants, any reports that might have been sought from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist the Department in replies, any submissions to the Minister in relation to the case, documents relating to previous reviews of the issues etc.  There were no documents removed from the files before they were submitted to Counsel. It was of course open to any complainant to submit any further documentation relevant to their case. It was also open to the Panel to seek additional information, if they felt that it was necessary.</p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  I am mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  In each case a submission will be prepared. Mr Justice Roderick Murphy will review the summary of the conclusion and the letter of notification drafted to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendation.</p>  <p>  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, notification letters have issued to 132 complainants.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.</p></reply>

The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence.</p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.</p>  <p>  The Bill is expected to be considered in the Houses during the Autumn session.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that this practice, which has been followed by my predecessors, arises for sound security reasons.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the legislative basis for the carrying out of covert surveillance is the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 while the interception of telecommunications is provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality I have no role whatsoever in the operation of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.  Under the 2009 Act, authorisations for intrusive surveillance are granted by a judge of the District Court on application by a superior officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners or the Defence Forces in circumstances which are set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  In relation to lawful interception, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides that an authorisation for interception may only be granted by Ministerial warrant on application from the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or protecting the security of the State.</p>  <p>  I should emphasise that the provisions of both Acts are subject to independent judicial oversight by Judges of the High Court, designated by the Government for that purpose.  The Designated Judge has complete and unrestricted access to all cases, documents, records, and personnel pertaining to the operation of the relevant legislation.  In addition, each Designated Judge reports to the Taoiseach on an annual basis on the operation of the legislation. These reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, both Acts provide for a complaints mechanism whereby an individual who believes that he or she has been subject to surveillance or whose communications have been intercepted may apply to the Complaints Referee, appointed in accordance with the relevant Act, for an investigation into the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I am maintaining the long-standing practice of my predecessors, but I can assure the Deputy that I have never exercised the legal powers I have to interfere in any way with the work of the category of persons to which he refers.</p></reply>

The following arrangements are now in place in an effort to improve throughput and relieve the congestion in the public office that occurs at this time of the year as demand for registration increases as students return to their studies. The aim is to reduce the number of persons who are required to call to the office to a minimum and on a par with the number who call at all other times of the year where no significant issues with queuing arise.</p><p>Beginning immediately, persons who are students of the colleges listed below and who are registering for the first time or seeking to renew their registrations should not<b></b>attend at the Public Office.  Separate arrangements are being put in place to register students of these colleges later in the autumn and these arrangements will be communicated directly to the colleges and students involved.  There is no need for students of these colleges to queue at Burgh Quay and no person will lose residence status or continuity of permission to remain by the application of these arrangements.  The colleges concerned are:</p><p>- Dublin City University (DCU),</p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology and constituent colleges (DIT)</p><p>- Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI),</p><p>- Dublin University (Trinity College),</p><p>- University College Dublin (UCD).</p><p>Commencing on Wednesday 30th September, all new registrations will be dealt with on Monday and Tuesday each week.  Wednesday to Friday is reserved for renewal of registrations i.e. for those who have an existing GNIB registration certificate.  In addition to these measures, extra staff resources are being deployed to the GNIB to assist with the registration process.  Weekend opening is also being arranged: the Public Office was open on 26th September and a date of 10th October has been announced, and further dates will be announced shortly.  The arrangements will be kept under constant review and changed or added to as required to address the demands on the office in this peak period.</p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to 500 people who are dealt with in the peak period at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8 am to 9 pm each Monday to Thursday and 8 am to 6 pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at the office; priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business.  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement is posted on the Garda website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.  Furthermore, those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.</p><p>In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a <i>&lsquo;</i>same day service<i>&rsquo;</i>at its Burgh Quay office.  Currently, this office handles all registrations in the Dublin area.  At times of high demand, it is not possible, currently, to send this demand elsewhere, it has to be accommodated within the capacity of the Burgh Quay office where the necessary technical infrastructure for registration card recording, generation of registration certificates and fingerprinting exists.  Use of other buildings for this purpose is not an option because the biometric equipment and elaborate smart card production systems are not mobile and in any event has to be linked up in real-time to the Garda IT systems.</p><p>Work is underway to transfer the registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  As part of that work new systems are being developed with the aim of reducing footfall and random arrivals to the public office by use of on-line systems and to undertake registrations renewals off-site.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff in the Public Office who diligently perform a very important function for the State.  It is one of the busiest public offices in the State dealing with, in the region of, 100,000 people every year.  The new arrangements outlined above mean that queuing is not necessary and these arrangements will be strictly enforced to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible.  I am anxious that queuing be reduced to the absolute minimum at the earliest possible opportunity whilst remaining consistent with the requirement to protect our immigration system from abuses.  I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to customers calling to this office.</p></reply>

The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing. The functions of the Authority will be subject to further consultation with key stakeholders in advance of the preparation of the necessary enabling legislation, which will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Accordingly, it is premature at this stage to decide on the make up of the Authority before the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Individual licensing decisions will continue to be made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the light of the determinations made by the Authority but it is intended that the Authority will adjudicate on appeals from decisions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The objective was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. The review concluded that a revised district and station network commensurate with the organisation resource base would best meet public demand.  The resulting Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme led to the closure of 139 Garda Stations and the amalgamation of 32 Garda districts during the course of 2012 and 2013.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that since 2013 and up to the present day, the period covered by the Deputy's question, the only Garda station closures were in the Clare Division.  On 31st January 2013, Kilmihil Garda Station closed and the policing services for the Kilmihil sub-district were transferred to Lissycasey Garda Station.  Lissycasey Garda Station was then closed on 2nd March 2015 following the reopening of Kilmihil Garda Station.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that Garda Stations which were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan for 2013 were returned to and are now under the control of the Office of Public Works (OPW).

In addition, the Garda Authorities would, of course, need to examine the implications of deploying Garda&iacute; to man the station during public office hours, thus diverting Garda&iacute; from being available in the community confronting crime head on.</p></reply>

It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population.</p><p>In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  The Census found that 6,449 children, equating to 5.6 per 1,000 children, provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016), an analysis is being carried out of those children who reported in the 2011 Census that they undertook caring roles. This analysis will be published in early 2016 and will be examined to see how it can help inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. It is planned to have another Census of Population in April 2016.

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people. Each project involves a cluster of schools working collectively to provide a range of supports and interventions designed to support individual children identified locally as being at risk of early school leaving within those school communities.</p>  <p>  The review of the School Completion Programme by the Economic and Social Research Institute has been finalised and arrangements are being made for its publication in early October.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  I am advised by the Agency that the allocation for School Completion Programme in 2015 is &euro;24.7 m, similar to the allocation provided in 2014.  Local School Completion Programme projects have been informed of their allocations for the current year.  With regard to the future funding for the programme, this will be determined in the light of the resources that become available to the Agency in the annual Estimates and Budgetary processes. The findings of the Economic and Social Research Institute review will be important in this regard. They will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future, in shaping its further development and ensuring that it is in line with the aims of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people (2014-2020).</p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the School Completion Programme services. The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency's educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.</p>  <p>  The Agency has advised that the funding provided to projects in the School Completion Programme is used to employ approximately 2000 project staff (full-time and part-time) and a further 1,400 sessional staff at local level. The Agency does not employ any persons directly in the Programme and the terms and conditions of employment are as agreed by individual employers in the local projects.</p></reply>

At present, approximately 1.7 million people, or about 37% of the total population, qualify for a medical card. There are no proposals to amend the current income guidelines for the granting of eligibility under the GMS Scheme.</p>  <p>  In the medical card assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Furthermore, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold, where deemed appropriate.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and the Medical Card Process Review in November 2014, Minister Varadkar and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs. These included changes to the governance and organisational structure of the medical card assessment function within the HSE to increase the focus on customer service in the assessment process.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also taken steps to ensure greater interaction between the medical card central assessment office and the Local Health Office and/or Primary Care Team to see if there are further circumstances or needs that would support a medical card application, and to ensure that assistance is provided to meet the individual's needs as far as possible (where they don't have a medical card).</p>  <p>  The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by about 76% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 92,000 at the end of August this year.</p></reply>

The NAS has a fleet of over 520 vehicles which travel over twenty million km each year.  Fleet management policies in place, minimise, as far as possible, the potential for vehicle failure.  Daily vehicle inspections are carried out by ambulance crews, and a defect logging system is in place.  Replacement of stock within the fleet runs at up to 15% a year and, in  2015, 62 new  ambulances will be added to the fleet, at a cost of &euro;7.5m.  The NAS adheres to vehicle manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications for service schedules and intervals.  In line with current manufacturer and warranty requirements, each manufacturer&rsquo;s main dealer network carries out the majority of heavy maintenance work. </p>  <p>  In relation to this specific issue, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

It is important to note that the actions in the Roadmap for Implementation are those that can be achieved on a cost neutral basis.</p><p>The National Carers' Strategy committed to the production of an Annual Report on progress which would be published on the websites of relevant Departments.  The first Annual Report on implementation of the Strategy was published in November 2013 and the second in January 2015, both of which are available on my Department's website.  These Annual Reports will provide the Deputy with a list of actions that were identified in the Strategy and what progress has been made on each one since the Strategy&rsquo;s publication.  The third Annual Report is currently being compiled and will be published over the coming months. </p><p>In May, the Carers Association published their <i>Family Carers Scorecard </i>which raised concerns over the pace of implementation.  Much work, however, has been done and the report acknowledged achievements such as the development of a single assessment tool for older people containing a detailed Carers Needs Assessment; the imminent release of one million euro funding from Dormant accounts for training and information provision for family carers; the hosting of an Annual Carers Forum by the Department of Social Protection and in particular the positive engagement around the structure of this forum to meet the needs of family carers.</p><p>At my Department's request, the HSE has set up a cross-divisional working group to bring forward implementation of the health aspects of the Strategy.</p><p>The Carers' Strategy is an acknowledgement by Government of the vital role performed by carers and of the contribution that they make, not only to their loved ones, but to society in general.  Rather than being a set of actions that can be completed in a defined time, the Strategy should be seen as a long-term statement of intent providing the context for carers and their advocates to successfully press their case for the recognition that they deserve.</p></reply>

The HSE is also committed to continuing to explore methods of community respite care as an alternative to centre-based respite care, including advancing the Host Family Support Model. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the HSE.</p></reply>

In this context, the implementation of the recommendations of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure is a priority for my Department.</p><p>In July 2013, a Working Group, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, President, Dublin City University, was established to carry out the Strategic Review.  The Working Group was tasked with examining and making high-level recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a view to:</p><p>-  Improving graduate retention in the public health system;</p><p>-  Planning for future service needs; and</p><p>-  Realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p><p>The Working Group completed its work in June 2014 and, in all, submitted three reports and made 25 recommendations.  The reports address a range of barriers and issues relating to the recruitment and retention of doctors in the Irish public health system. </p><p>The Strategic Review recommendations are being implemented through a range of structures and processes across the health system.  Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.  To support implementation of the recommendations, my Department has also established an Implementation Monitoring Group, comprising key stakeholders.  To date, two progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These allow all stakeholders to assess the progress being made across the range of Strategic Review recommendations.  At this point the focus is on the implementation of these measures, to support retention.  It is not considered feasible at present to introduce a mandatory requirement to stay in Ireland post graduation. </p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy regarding both the numbers qualifying annually and the numbers emigrating.

The Mental Health Commission has been advised accordingly, and I understand that arrangements are being made to advertise the post later this week.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, with effect from 18 February 2014, the commitment of two other part-time Assistant Inspectors was increased from 0.75 WTE to 0.95 WTE to address the temporary shortfall in staffing levels and to allow the Office of the Inspector to fulfil its statutory obligations.</p></reply>

These medicines include adrenaline (epinephrine) autoinjectors, salbutamol, glyceryl trinitrate, glucagon and naloxone.</p>  <p>  Any measures increasing accessibility to emergency medicines will require persons administering such products to have satisfactorily completed a course of training which has been accredited and approved.</p>  <p>  The Statutory Instrument on access to emergency medicines, which I expect to sign shortly, will address these training requirements.</p></reply>

The project to be delivered at Naas General Hospital is more extensive than the endoscopy services department referred to.  In addition it includes accommodation and ancillary services to support the new physical medicine, physical therapy, oncology services and day procedures departments. All stages of capital projects, including the design and tendering processes, are subject to review to ensure that the projects deliver value for money. This includes, where possible, '<i>future </i>proofing' to ensure that capital developments meet not just current standards but that provision is made for additional capacity and/or improved equipping and that these are addressed appropriately. In this regard the strategic upgrade to the specification which the project's design and tender documents will reflect are - a duplex (rather than simplex) reverse osmosis filtration system and two lifts.  Currently, HSE Estates is in consultation with the hospital's clinical leads to ensure that the project's specification and building tender documents are fully defined as soon as is possible.  The HSE must also ensure that its tendering documents are comprehensive and comply with national guidelines and EU directives. </p></reply>

In practice, product information is very frequently updated as new data become available through various sources of post-marketing experience, including further studies, literature reviews, and evaluation of adverse reaction data. In this context there have been numerous updates and changes to the product information for Roaccutane from January 1998 until now.</p>  <p>  The current product information was supplied to the Deputy on 26 May 2015 in response to a previous parliamentary question. Information on the various changes over the years would require a detailed and time-consuming search by the HPRA through archived material and various databases used over the time.

Use of isotretinoin has also been consistently contraindicated in women of childbearing potential since the product was first authorised, unless all of the conditions specified in the product information are met. </p>  <p>  An EU wide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) was introduced in October 2003 to further reduce the potential risk of pregnancy in women by expanding the available information and highlighting the well-known and documented risks related to use in women of child-bearing potential. These measures include supplementary information distributed to prescribing doctors, pharmacists, other relevant healthcare professionals and patients, including the following:</p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s guide to prescribing Roaccutane to female patients;</p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s checklist for prescribing to female patients;</p>  <p>  -  Patient information brochure;</p>  <p>  - Important information for patients prescribed Roaccutane on contraception; and</p>  <p>  -  Pharmacist&rsquo;s guide to dispensing Roaccutane.</p>  <p>  The PPP applies across all EU member states and is monitored and reviewed at EU level. The company submits the information gathered through the PPP on a yearly basis to the competent authority for each EU member state (i.e. HPRA in Ireland). The European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s (EMA&rsquo;s) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), (at which Ireland is represented by the HPRA) assesses the data provided to consider any need to strengthen/amend the PPP as part of the regular review of the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 were amended in 2005 to introduce restrictions on certain medicines containing Isotretinoin.  Regulation 7(9)  of the Regulations provides that the prescription of a medicine containing Isotretinoin (not being for external use) which is intended for the treatment of a woman of childbearing potential, shall not be dispensed later than seven days after the date on the prescription and the treatment shall not exceed a period of thirty days.</p></reply>

The Framework is based on evidence and experience from around the world which clearly shows that to create positive changes in health and wellbeing takes the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society working in unison. On that basis, it is not possible to identify in totality how much funding is currently spent on improving health and wellbeing across all Government Departments and agencies and in wider society. </p><p>Since Healthy Ireland was launched in March 2013, expenditure on its implementation from within the budget of the Department of Health has amounted to the following:</p><p>2013 - &euro;89,315.07</p><p>2014 - &euro;586,470.90</p><p>2015 - &euro;252,292.02 (to date)</p><p>In addition to the expenditure noted above, other expenditure arising within the Department could also be described as &quot;Healthy Ireland&quot; depending on classification. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that expenditure arising in the HSE, particularly in the Health and Wellbeing Division, could also be described as implementation of Healthy Ireland. However, it is not possible to disaggregate expenditure on promoting and improving health and wellbeing generally from overall HSE expenditure. Again, for example, within overall HSE expenditure, and in addition to work which is an integral part of the Health and Wellbeing Division, a large component of health promotion and improvement work takes place across the acute and primary care services as part of normal day to day activity. There is also expenditure arising in relation to communications campaigns by the HSE.  </p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school. I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p><p>The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year. However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise. This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.</p><p>The <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>children and young people's policy framework that has been developed by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs contains a commitment to develop a plan for the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school and early years settings. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has lead responsibility for the implementation of this commitment and has recently concluded an intensive process of deliberation and consultation on the matter in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is ongoing to develop an appropriate model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with special needs in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual cases he has highlighted.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. </p></reply>

Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  Under Section 49 of the Act the Chief Inspector must establish and maintain a register of designated centres. Details entered into the register include the name of the centre, address and date of registration. This information is published and available on the Authority&rsquo;s website </p><p>Discussions are ongoing between the HSE and HIQA regarding the conditions that will apply to public facilities across the country. Funding available for capital investment in Community Nursing Units will be allocated on the basis of careful prioritisation  across all such facilities, with the welfare of residents always being the primary concern.</p><p>It is worth noting that although many public facilities are old, and are therefore not in line with how modern facilities are designed and configured, the standard of care delivered to residents is generally of a very high standard, and residents and their families frequently express their appreciation of the care that they receive.</p></reply>

The new institutions as agreed by the Stormont House Agreement provide for different ways of dealing with the past.  The new Historical Investigations Unit provides for police investigation and, where there is an evidential basis, the prospect of justice.  The Stormont House Agreement makes clear that this will be an independent body.  The Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, to be established by the two Governments, is intended to allow individuals to seek information about troubles related deaths where there is no realistic prospect of prosecution; information provided to the Commission for this purpose would not be admissible in court. </p>  <p>   In addition, an Oral History Archive will be established.  These bodies will be overseen by an Implementation and Reconciliation Group, with a mandate to promote reconciliation, a better understanding of the past and to reduce sectarianism.   </p>  <p>  I believe that taken together these four mechanisms provide an opportunity to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in a way which upholds the rule of law and facilitates justice, acknowledges and addresses the needs of victims and survivors, is human rights compliant, and above all promotes reconciliation. </p>  <p>  It is now crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing these institutions is completed and this is one of the central objectives of the current round table talks involving the five main Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments. </p>  <p>  For these institutions to function effectively, it is vitally important that they have public trust and confidence. This is why I have placed the principle of independence at the centre of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the establishment of the institutions.  I agree that public consultation on the establishment of the institutions is also important in this regard. </p>  <p>  The majority of the commitments in the Stormont House Agreement, including those related to the past, pertain to matters within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive.  However, in order to expedite the establishment of the legacy institutions, the British Government has agreed to bring forward the required legislation in Westminster.  It is therefore the responsibility of the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to consider the question of a public consultation within its jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  In regard to legislating within this jurisdiction to fulfil the commitments of the Irish Government under the Stormont House Agreement, the normal parliamentary process and scrutiny will of course apply.  I and my colleagues in Government have a very open dialogue with families and victims and survivors groups.  Issues relating to the new legacy institutions have been discussed with them on a number of occasions and this has helped guide the Government&rsquo;s approach.  We will of course continue this active engagement in the context of bringing forward the required domestic legislation to establish and cooperate with the new legacy institutions.</p></reply>

The working holiday arrangement is not based on a visa, but on a Working Holiday Authorisation.  The current Working Holiday Authorisation is activated by arrival of the holder in Ireland.  The holder is subject to normal border immigration controls upon arrival.  Applicants must have sufficient funds to support themselves for at least the initial part of the holiday or in the event of failing to secure employment.  Immigration officials may request evidence of sufficient funds at the point of entry to Ireland.  The Authorisation is valid for a period not exceeding 12 months after entry into Ireland.  It is not possible to extend the period of validity of Working Holiday Authorisations, or to accept a second application from someone who has already been granted an Authorisation (whether or not they availed of it).</p>  <p>  Should the person wish to remain in the State after the validity of the Working Holiday Authorisation, then they should explore the immigration options available to remain legally in the State with the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Ireland has consistently supported greater engagement by the Security Council on tackling the crisis in Syria and co-sponsored a recent resolution on referral of the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court earlier this year.  Regrettably, the Security Council has in recent years repeatedly failed to agree on effective measures to tackle the political and security situation in Syria, with the repeated vetoes on proposed action by permanent members of the Council.  There is little prospect that any proposal for such a resolution will be approved by the Council at this time.  I have expressed on many occasions my deep concerns and frustration at the blockages in the Security Council.  I am actively supporting efforts to reform the Council to improve its effectiveness.  In the meantime, I am backing, as a step in the right direction, a French initiative for a code of conduct which would suspend the use of the veto in situations of mass atrocities. </p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. At primary level, it  currently operates on the basis of 1 classroom teacher for an average of every  28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us  to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers. </p><p>  I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future. In the last Budget, I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years. I am determined to continue pressing the case for increased investment in education in the  forthcoming budget. </p><p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

The forum was established on the understanding that the unions accepted that there would be no change in the existing employment relationship and that consideration of any proposals must have regard to current and future budgetary provision and related financial constraints.</p><p>  The first aspect of the forum's tasks (establishing the factual position in schools regarding terms and conditions, including pay, of School Secretaries and Caretakers) was completed.  However, discussions on the second element (the proposal of the unions to introduce an interim minimum pay rate) did not begin due to the State's serious budgetary and financial position, as any agreement would inevitably result in increased costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>  It was recently agreed that my Department would engage with the union side in relation to issues around the pay of Caretakers and Secretaries.  The parties have now entered an arbitration process conducted by the Labour Relations Commission.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the arbitration process is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.</p></reply>

Retained fire-fighters who opted not to join the scheme receive, on retirement, a gratuity of 1/8th of the annual retainer multiplied by the number of years of actual service (up to a maximum of four times the annual retainer). All retained fire-fighters appointed after 1 January 2013 must join the Single Public Service Pension Scheme. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 states that any public servant who is a member of a public service pension scheme, is entitled to a benefit under such a scheme, or receives a payment in lieu of membership of such a scheme, is subject to a deduction from their remuneration. Additional pension benefits do not arise as a result of this deduction. </p>  <p>  The payment of the retirement gratuity to retained firefighters who are not members of the LGSS is a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme and, as such, all retained fire-fighters, whether members of a public service pension scheme or not, are subject to the deduction outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. Responsibility for this legislation rests with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Where a retained firefighter is also employed by a local authority in another position, he or she would be a member of the LGSS in respect of that position and would receive a pension and retirement lump sum at retirement based on the pensionable remuneration and length of service for that position. </p></reply>

For that reason, I increased the funding available for the schemes in 2015 which, at &euro;50.5 million, is an increase of some 10% on last year. I trust that this increase will enable local authorities to deliver an increased level of service to their citizens. I expect that some 8,000 households will benefit under the schemes in 2015. </p>  <p>  My Department works with local authorities to ensure a full drawdown of their allocation. Through careful management of my Department&rsquo;s housing budget in 2014, additional funds were made available to local authorities with high levels of grant activity. I will be applying the same scrutiny to the capital budget for 2015 and, in the event of savings arising , these grants will be a priority for supplementary funding. </p>  <p>  At local level, the detailed administration and processing of these Schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>   The income limits for the scheme were last amended in 2014 arising from the recommendations of a review group and I have no plans to revise them further.  A priority for the scheme is to spread the benefits as widely as possible and ensure fairness and value for money in their operation. The scheme is therefore more sharply focussed towards households with greatest needs, especially lower income households. </p></reply>

The monitoring costs (generally between &euro;60 - &euro;80 per annum) are not funded under the Scheme and are borne by the beneficiary. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of Pobal. Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms. The tender process, which was led by Pobal, is now complete. The tender included a requirement for suppliers to set out their value added services, including the supply of smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms and any other security devices. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers have now been contracted to provide base units, which can be landline or GSM, and pendants. </p>  <p>   My Department will, over the coming months, examine options to provide additional security devices under the scheme. In the meantime, Pobal is in the process of introducing the local community and voluntary groups to a new service model for the scheme. This will reduce the administrative burden on groups so that they are free to focus on engaging with the older people in the community. </p>  <p>   The funding allocated for the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2015 was &euro;2.35m and this allocation is sufficient to meet current demands on this very worthwhile scheme. </p></reply>

The issues arising with Shared Ownership Schemes require careful consideration and expert financial data analysis.  Arising from the findings of the review to date, the Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.</p><p>In addition, the recent reduction of 0.20% in the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate will also benefit many Share Ownership borrowers.

To date, there are over 4,000 households supported by HAP across these local authority areas, including 144 previously homeless households.  52 of these homeless households have been housed with the assistance of the additional supports provided by the Dublin Homeless HAP pilot scheme which has been in operation since February 2015.  The Homeless HAP pilot scheme is managed by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE), an established shared-service arrangement between the four housing authorities in the region for which Dublin City Council is the lead authority.  Regulations came into effect on 18 December 2014, which extend the statutory HAP pilot to cover the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, in respect of homeless households only.</p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP pilot is targeted at households qualified for social housing support that are considered homeless by the housing authority concerned and that stayed in &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; funded accommodation on 1 December 2014 or at any time within the preceding 6 months.  In order to take account of the particular difficulties with sourcing suitable rental accommodation in Dublin city and county local authority areas, the maximum rents set out in the homeless HAP regulations provide that up to an additional 20% above the current Rent Supplement rent limit applicable may be payable.</p>  <p>  It was agreed by all stakeholders that a review of the homeless HAP pilot would be prepared following six months of operation.  Issues in relation to the operation of the scheme, such as the date for eligibility to access the homeless HAP pilot scheme, are currently being considered as part of that review process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-09-29a.1330.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015092900076#WRZ01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 593 to 600, inclusive, together.</p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  The HAP scheme removes a barrier to employment, by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment, it improves regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and it provides certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by their local authority.</p><p>Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord.</p><p>The first phase of the statutory pilot for the HAP scheme commenced in September 2014 and has been introduced incrementally to 13 local authority areas to date-Limerick City and County Council; Waterford City and County Council; Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin, Monaghan, Donegal, Offaly, Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils; and Cork City Council.  Dublin City Council is also implementing the HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.</p><p>For the purposes of the statutory pilot, Limerick City and County Council have been acting as the lead authority in respect of the HAP project and are providing a transactional shared service hub for all local authorities operating HAP during the pilot phase.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020 sets a target of 8,400 households to be supported by HAP by end 2015.  To date, there are over 4,000 households being supported by HAP across the pilot local authority areas operating the scheme.  As the HAP scheme is being rolled out on a phased pilot basis, formal targets for individual local authority area swere not set for 2015.  However, projected HAP tenancies have been determined and the relevant local authorities are working to achieve these. </p><p>Each Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  My Department works closely with all local authorities and all have been invited to submit staffing sanction requests to facilitate the delivery of the <i>Social Housing Strategy.</i>Each staffing sanction request is examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints.  My Department has sanctioned 36 posts to date to provide for the delivery of HAP across all Local Authorities.</p><p>While securing accommodation under HAP can be challenging in areas where there is a shortage of supply, the numbers of households securing accommodation nationally under HAP continues to rise, with an average of 90 new tenancies being registered each week in 2015.  The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  My Department works closely with DSP and monitors data which it gathers, along with data gathered by HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>In this context, I have recognised that South Dublin County Council required additional flexibility in the operation of HAP given the challenging rental market within its administrative area.  Regulations were signed in July 2015 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself to provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the previous maximum rent limits in South Dublin, where such flexibility is necessary in order to secure a suitable dwelling for the household concerned.  My Department continues to keep this matter under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas, including Louth County Council.</p><p>In relation to the operation of HAP in the administrative area of Louth County Council, the scheme has been piloted there since 1 October 2014.  There are currently 500 households being supported by HAP, with an average of 12 HAP tenancies being set-up per week in 2015.  While my Department doe s not hold a detailed breakdown , by local authority, of landlords who are receiving payments on behalf of HAP households, I understand that there are some 361 landlords or agents acting on behalf of landlords currently receiving HAP payments in the administrative area of Louth County Council. The total amount paid to landlords by the HAP transactional shared service hub in respect of these tenancies to date in 2015 is &euro;1,496,624.</p><p>Finally, my Department has also met on a regular basis with the pilot local authorities, including Louth County Council, to provide briefing in relation to the scheme and to get their feedback on operational matters.  This engagement is proving invaluable as the roll out of the scheme progresses.  I am pleased at how the HAP scheme is being operated within the administrative area of Louth County Council and I would like to commend the local authority on its engagement with the scheme to date.</p></reply>

We expect to publish an updated version of the Map before the end of this year.</p><p>I would encourage all members of the public to consult my Department's map as well as the publicly available information being provided on their websites by the various commercial operators in order to establish the precise status of their individual premises.</p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which was published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention. It sets out the key elements of the intervention - what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds being demanded, the length of the contract for services, and whether the network should be public or privately owned. </p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and engagement with industry stakeholders has indicated that this could be achieved within 3-5 years of the contract award.</p><p>In this context, the NBP proposes that through the combination of commercial investment and State intervention, 85% of addresses in Ireland will have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses passed by 2020.</p></reply>

The development, which will provide 471 student beds, is expected to be ready for occupation by students in September 2016, in time for the beginning of the academic year 2016&ndash;2017. Matters relating to the construction of the student accommodation are for the developer and not one in which I have a function.  Under the terms of the strategic partnership agreement between KSH and DHDA , KSH refurbished an adjacent DHDA-owned building, the Grainstore, for use by the DHDA as enterprise office accommodation to expand its Digital Hub cluster.

A condition of the consent is that the salary costs and expenses of my Department&rsquo;s staff will be met by the film company.</p><p>Section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930 (as amended) provides that, in the case of a national monument such as Skellig Michael, Ministerial consent must be obtained for any proposals:</p><p>(a) to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter, or in any manner injure or interfere with any such national monument, or</p><p>(b) to excavate, dig, plough or otherwise disturb the ground within, around, or in proximity to any such national monument, or</p><p>(c) to sell for exportation or to export any such national monument or any part thereof.</p><p>The film producer&rsquo;s proposals were carefully considered by my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service in that context.  This screening assessment confirmed that there would be no physical interference with the monument or with archaeological deposits and my Department was, therefore, satisfied that they fell outside the scope of the consent requirement.  The National Monuments Service also gave advance notice of the filming to UNESCO's World Heritage Centre in Paris.</p><p>My decision to grant consent in this case was notified to UNESCO and the European Commission and neither body has indicated any issues with the process and its outcome.  I am satisfied that this is an excellent example of how film-making can operate in harmony with environmental protection, providing that all necessary safeguards are in place, allowing us to showcase our unique cultural and heritage to a global audience. </p><p>As I stated previously, I will receive a full report on the film shoot in due course.  However, the relevant experts from my Department have indicated that they are satisfied that all protocols and conditions set down in the consent were adhered to fully by the production team and that there were no issues from an ecological and habitats standpoint.</p><p>It may be noted that the consent issued in this case and other relevant documentation have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p></reply>

In this regard, I am committed, together with my Government colleagues, to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.</p><p>The <i>Community Participation</i>strand of the programme is being led by local authorities across the country and I have been working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly, T.D., in this regard.  Each local authority has appointed a steering committee and a dedicated 'Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme' co-ordinator, to support engagement and facilitation within local communities to generate awareness of the national programme; and to develop and deliver a plan for a suitable programme of events and initiatives to take place at a county level in line with the national plans for Ireland 2016.  A series of public meetings in each county has taken place, at which members of the public came together to hear about Ireland 2016, meet those involved in their community, and to explore and learn about how they can get involved.  In support of this effort, I have provided &euro;1m, divided equally between the local authorities, to drive programme development at local level. </p><p>Each local authority has developed its own systems for inviting proposals from members of the public who are seeking funding for events relating to the centenary commemorations.  Interested parties can contact the local co-ordinator in their local authorities in the first instance.  Contact details can be found on the website .  The decision-making process in this instance is a matter for the local authorities involved.</p><p>Comprehensive county plans detailing the centenary commemorations to be held in each local authority area are scheduled to be released in early October.</p></reply>

The Council, although funded by my Department, is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and specifically in its funding decisions.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the Arts Council's activities and operation over the period 2009 to 2012 was recently published by my Department.  It was undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit under the guidance of an expert Steering Committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, Professor of Economics at Trinity College.  The review commends the Council for its response to the economic crisis by significantly reducing administration costs; overhauling its organisational structures; and developing on its RAISE initiative, which helps arts organisations to diversify funding streams.</p><p>The review also highlights the need for the Council to expand its efforts to improve transparency around its decision making; give greater consideration to addressing the issue of regional balance in accessing the arts; and to engage more with stakeholders and establish the evidence-base for the societal benefits of its work.</p><p>The Value for Money Policy Review should act as an important tool for the Arts Council to improve its hugely beneficial work in funding arts organisations across the State.  It is available to download on my Department's website.</p><p>The Arts Council has recently published its new strategy <i>Making Great Art Work</i>which sets out its plan for leading the development of the arts in Ireland over the next decade and which also reflects some of the outcomes of the Value for Money review.  Further information on the strategy is available on the website of the Council at .</p><p>I propose to meet the Council shortly to discuss implementation of the recommendations of the Review and the Council&rsquo;s new strategy.</p></reply>
