    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-06a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110600051#WRA00600"><p>My Department commenced a review of the public capital programme in April of this year in parallel with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure. The purpose of the review is to assess all areas of public capital investment and to refresh the existing investment strategy and multi-annual envelopes to ensure that they are in line with emerging Government priorities and that our limited resources are focussed on the areas that can best support continued, sustainable and equitable growth. </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, new mutli-annual ministerial expenditure ceilings (both capital and current) for the years 2015 to 2017 were published in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report on Budget Day. This Budget marked a move away from cuts to overall spending and allowed for some targeted increases in both capital and current expenditure. On the capital side, significant levels of Government investment are set out for the next three years to support Social Housing, Transport, Education, Health and the Enterprise Sector. The Capital Review is being finalised at the moment and will be published before the end of the year. It will set out a multi-annual capital investment framework to the end of the decade, including the 3 year ceilings announced in the Budget.</p><p>  The Deputy has asked specifically about the potential for using development bonds to fund national infrastructure. The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) indicates that project-specific bonds would not be the most effective way forward. However, the Government has been actively exploring other non-traditional approaches to financing capital projects that could be viable, and we have been able to make some notable announcements recently. In this context, on Budget Day I announced that it is intended that &euro;400m of public investment would be available, including from the proceeds of the sale of the Bord G&aacute;is energy business, for investment in social housing through an off-balance sheet financial vehicle which will channel funds to the voluntary housing sector. I also announced that Public Private Partnerships would be used to deliver 1,500 social housing units by 2017. Both of these are in addition to the significant direct Exchequer investment in the social housing programme over the next three years, and the appropriate use of non-traditional funding approaches such as these can help us increase the level of investment available beyond what we can provide through normal Exchequer voted spending.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that we are setting up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. The ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise the resources transferred from the NPRF by attracting third-party co-investment. In this way, the Fund's assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-06a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110600052#WRB00400"><p>The Government Decision of 11 February 2014 allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for clean-up, repair and restoration works in relation to public infrastructure that was damaged in the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014. Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure based on cost estimates and submissions made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG). This funding is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities. The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.</p><p>  In addition to the &euro;19.6m funding for local authorities, an amount of &euro;1.2m was also allocated under the Government Decision for repair of damage to OPW's own coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.</p><p>  Based on the programmes of works for repairs to coastal protection infrastructure that were submitted by local authorities, total funding of &euro;19.0 million was approved by the OPW for 176 projects that were deemed to be within the scope of the works covered by the Government Decision.  In this regard I would point out that the Government Decision did not allocate funding for strengthening or new coastal protection works. It applied to repairs of existing infrastructure only. </p><p>  The prioritisation and progression of the repair works is entirely a matter for the local authorities. The progress made by local authorities in carrying out the repairs has varied from county to county depending on the particular circumstances prevailing and the scale and nature of the damage to be repaired in that area.  Overall however, I am generally satisfied that the Councils have gone about the repair work in an efficient manner and I encourage them to continue to progress the works as expeditiously as possible.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the OPW has made excellent progress on the repair of damage to the flood defence infrastructure, mainly embankments, for which it is directly responsible and that most of the required repair work has now been completed.</p><p>  The question of improving flood defences through significant strengthening or upgrading of existing defences or new works  is a separate issue to the programmes of repair works for which specific funding was allocated by the Government Decision. The requirements for such improvement or new works is being assessed in the context of the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM)  programme. The principal output of this important programme will be a series of integrated plans of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the main areas of flood risk throughout the country. </p><p>  Good progress is being made on the six regional CFRAM Studies under the National CFRAM Programme.  There are three main stages in the Programme each involving public consultation:</p><p>  - Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA)  - finalised in 2011</p><p>  - Flood Hazard Mapping  - 2013 &ndash; 2014; informal public consultation on maps now underway and formal, statutory public consultation to commence early 2015</p><p>  - Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans &ndash; draft Plans available by end 2015 with a view to having Plans finalised in 2016</p></reply>

The recently published report on the 'Accounts of the Public Service 2013' is part of the wider accountability framework for the delivery of these services. </p><p>  The report in question is concerned with the accountability of departments and offices in respect of their administration of public funds. As outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it was prepared on the basis of audited information, where available, and other information, documentation and explanations obtained from the relevant government departments and offices. </p><p>  Drafts of relevant parts of the Report were sent to the departments and offices concerned and their comments were requested. Where appropriate, those comments are incorporated into the Report. As such, the Report itself contains information on the actions being taken across the relevant Departments on foot of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General. In this context, the majority of the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General have been agreed by the relevant Accounting Officers and indeed, where appropriate, by my own Department. </p><p>  In due course, the Committee of Public Accounts will examine and report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this Report and my Department will prepare a formal response to the recommendations, (the 'Minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform') in consultation with the departments and offices concerned.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-06a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110600052#WRB01000"><p>The main purpose of the EU public procurement regime is to open up the market and to ensure the free movement of supplies, services and works within the EU having regard to Treaty of Rome principles including transparency, proportionality and equal treatment. This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime. </p><p>  The new EU rules comprise a suite of three Directives (Public Procurement, Utilities and Concessions) that repeal the existing rules governing the conduct of procurement across the EU but the basic architecture of EU procurement will remain intact. The changes in the new regime were agreed principally to streamline the public procurement process and to put in place more simplified and flexible rules to reduce red tape and to make the procurement process more efficient. </p><p>  While most of the rules are mandatory for Ireland and all other Member States to implement into national law, there is some limited policy latitude permitted to Member States in transposing the new regime into national legislation. The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process. In this context, I launched on Friday last, 31st October, a public consultation on the new Directives.  The document is available on the OGP website www.procurement.ie and written submissions are invited from stakeholders and interested parties on the issues raised in the consultation document by 12 December 2014. Consideration will be given to the responses received, (including those related to the environmental, social and labour law considerations article 18(2) requirements)   when drafting the Statutory Instruments to implement the EU rules into national law.</p><p>  Social clauses in contracts place obligations on suppliers to perform actions focussed on broader policy considerations. They can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties at tender stage and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  As the Deputy is fully aware, the Government has recently supported in principle a Private Members Bill put forward by her Party in relation to social clauses.  The Government is not opposed to the principle of social clauses and sees significant merit in developing a social clauses framework.  We believe however that the inclusion of social clauses needs to be done in a targeted manner and not in the &quot;across the board manner&quot; suggested by the Bill.  The Government favours a targeted approach to the use of social clauses focussed on contracts where employers are likely to be hiring additional workers to deliver the contract.  This is likely to mitigate the risk of displacing workers already in employment while offering the opportunity of assisting with labour activation measures for the long-term unemployed.   </p><p>  I should point out that, as the Deputy is aware, there are already a number of initiatives under way in this area.</p><p>  A devolved schools programme is being administered by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  This involves three contracts covering fourteen sites with the works comprising both stand-alone, new build and extensions/refurbishment works. Construction work started on all three of the contracts during Spring 2014. The aggregate capital value of the contracts is c. &euro;70m.  I understand that overall compliance in relation to the pilot clause has been good. The Department of Social Protection and its local Intreo offices are working closely with the appointed contractors to support the pilot initiative.  There has been strong positive engagement from the contractors involved in each of the projects.</p><p>  In addition on the 9th  of June I announced the establishment of a Social Clauses Project Group to pro-actively look at projects with a view to including social clauses to ensure those awarded contracts contribute to employment or training opportunities for long term unemployed. </p><p>  Specific projects that are currently in planning and are deemed potentially suitable for the inclusion of employment opportunities and social inclusion will be identified and targeted to maximise the potential opportunities from these projects.</p><p>  I have asked the Office of Government Procurement to review this pilot project after 12 months and then to issue guidance. </p><p>  Overall the Government believes that further debate and discussion is required as to the correct policy approach regarding enabling social clauses, mindful of the need to maintain flexibility and adapt to changing circumstances.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-11-06a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014110600052#WRB01300"><p>In 2012 the Government reviewed the position on the payment of performance related reward schemes or bonuses for Chief Executive Officers in Commercial State Companies and agreed to continue with the policy which it introduced in 2011 of requesting the State Companies concerned not to award such bonus payments in light of the serious state of the public finances. Furthermore the Government agreed to continue with the practice of excluding the payment of bonus provisions in the employment contracts of newly appointed CEOs to such State Companies as well as in respect of contract renewals for incumbent CEOs. </p><p>  The requirement to cease such forms of bonus payment together with other basic salary reductions introduced by this Government in respect of the CEOs in State Companies was necessitated by the very difficult financial and economic circumstances facing this country.  The Government will accordingly continue to consider future policy developments in relation to performance related pay for the CEOs concerned in the light of prevailing circumstances.    </p><p>  I have no role in relation to the Performance Related Award Schemes for staff below CEO level in Commercial State Companies.   </p><p>  It is expected that the Boards of these organisations act responsibly in designing and implementing pay structures that drive performance in the competitive environment in which they operate, while ensuring that they are fully compliant with Government pay policy.  In view of the fact that Irish Water is a newly created monopoly entity, it will be important that the organisation actively demonstrates that it is performing well for the people it serves before any additional award system can be shown to be  merited. </p><p>  With regard to the Non-Commercial State Companies, it is a matter of Government policy that Performance Related Award Schemes continue to be suspended on an indefinite basis.  Access to such schemes is no longer included in the employment contracts for newly-appointed CEOs or in contract renewals for incumbent CEOs.  It is a matter for parent Departments in the first instance to ensure that all bodies under their aegis are fully in compliance with Government pay policy in its application.</p></reply>

It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size, etc. and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  </p><p>  In April of this year my Department reviewed and updated existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10/14 was issued and sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  The main thrust of the circular is as follows:</p><p>  - buyers are advised to undertake market analysis prior to tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer, the competitive landscape, including the specific capabilities of SMEs, etc. </p><p>  - the circular promotes transparency in procurement by requiring supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 be advertised on the Government's electronic tendering portal, e-Tenders,</p><p>  - it encourages suppliers including SMEs to fully use e-Tenders and avail of its facilities in relation to registration, e-tendering and automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities</p><p>  - buyers are encouraged not to set turnover thresholds at more than twice the estimated contract value and puts limits on insurance levels for suppliers, where possible</p><p>  - promotes greater use of &quot;open&quot; tendering and less use of &quot;restrictive&quot; tendering </p><p>  - it  encourages SMEs to consider using consortia where they are not of sufficient scale to tender in their own right or where they may lack certain capabilities necessary to provide a compelling proposition</p><p>  - it encourages Contracting Authorities to break large contracts down into lots where reasonable to do so and where it does not expose the State to undue risk or significant management overheads</p><p>  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines.   The new Circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations. </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement also supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  The OGP for example supported two &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events in Belfast and Dublin last year attended by approximately 1,000 suppliers. Approximately 1,700 are expected to attend similar events this year.  In addition, the OGP supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by 317 SME's last year.   This year InterTrade Ireland are also  delivering a programme on Consortia Building to assist SME's in developing understanding to enable them to jointly bid for state contracts.   </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement is establishing structures for its sourcing teams around categories of procurement spend e.g. ICT, professional services, facilities managements, etc.  These specialised sourcing teams will work with representatives from Departments &amp;amp; Agencies in Category Councils to develop category-specific strategies that seek to establish the best commercial approach to the supply market that balances the need to achieve value for the money for the State with other objectives such as supply market sustainability, and other Government Policy objectives. The content of these strategies will vary depending upon the nature of the goods and services required.  </p><p>  Before any significant sourcing activity is undertaken, the OGP will conduct a full supply market analysis to establish a comprehensive understanding of that market on the appropriate national, regional or local basis.  Part of this analysis would take into account the relative importance the scale of State business and the current market structures, and build the results of this analysis into the final strategy to maximise sustainable competition and opportunities for SMEs. </p><p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

Significantly, the most recent pay reduction effected by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, was confined to those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more only, and the core pay of almost 87% of public servants was not impacted by this pay reduction.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that in seeking the most recent savings and reductions from the public service pay and pensions bill, public service employers and trade unions entered into negotiations and concluded a collective agreement, the Haddington Road Agreement. This three year Agreement, effective from July 2013, built upon and reaffirmed the existing overall commitments in the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) including those in relation to lower paid public servants and sets the terms of pay in the public service until 2016.  </p><p>  As provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and subsequently legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year was reduced from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p><p>  The public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim next year.  If such a claim is made, the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position. As I have already stated, the legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, will also have to be addressed as part of putting in place more normal pay setting arrangements in the public service for the future. </p><p>   Finally my colleague the Minister for Business and Employment is currently developing proposals to implement the Government programme commitment to establish a Low Pay Commission (LPC) on a statutory basis as an independent body to make annual recommendations to the Government about the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters.</p><p>  I would anticipate that the Commission would also have to take into account low paid public servants as part of their considerations.</p></reply>

Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG). This funding for repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities. The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.<br/><br/>In addition to the &euro;19.6m funding for local authorities, an amount of &euro;1.2m was also allocated under the Government Decision for repair of damage to OPW's own coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.<br/><br/>Based on the programmes of works of repairs to coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure that were submitted by local authorities, total funding of &euro;19.0 million was approved by the OPW for 176 projects that were deemed to be within the scope of the works covered by the Government Decision. The prioritisation and progression of projects is entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned. <br/><br/>To date, local authorities have submitted claims for drawn down of funding of &euro;1.639 million in respect of projects that have been completed, are under construction, or where contracts for the works have been placed. The OPW has paid a total of &euro;385,000 to date to the local authorities in respect of those claims.  The balance of claims are being processed by the OPW and will be paid very shortly.

Indeed, the Deputy will be aware that one of the first actions of this Government on taking office was to increase with effect from July 2011, the Statutory Minimum Wage rate, reduced by the previous Government in 2010, to its pre-existing rate. While the fiscal emergency which arose through the mismanagement of the economy by the previous Government gave rise to the exceptional statutory reductions in pay imposed on public servants, the process of collective bargaining has survived and has been highlighted by the concluding of difficult public service agreements including most recently, the Haddington Road Agreement, by staff representatives and their public service employers. </p><p>  In relation to the pay reductions imposed on public servants through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013, the reductions imposed have been progressive, thereby ensuring that reductions imposed impacted on low paid workers least and that higher reductions were imposed on the higher paid. Significantly, the more recent  pay cuts applied to public servants under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 and the Haddington Road Agreement apply only to those higher paid public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more. The core pay of 87% of the workers in the public service was not reduced by the legislation.</p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement sets the terms of pay in the public service until 2016.  The fiscal targets in Budget 2014, which the Government is committed to achieving, are based on the reduced remuneration rates as well as on the revenue accruing from the Pension Related Deduction and Public Service Pension Reduction as provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts. </p><p>  In order to continue the recent encouraging evidence of progress in relation to the public finances, any amelioration in the impact of the Financial Emergency measures, and public service pay policy generally, will continue to have regard to our overall fiscal targets including achieving a deficit of less than 3% of GDP by the end of 2015.  Nevertheless, the Government has acted to begin an amelioration of the measures. As provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement and subsequently legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year fell from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014. This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of an increase to take-home pay.</p><p>  The public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim next year.  If such a claim is made the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position. The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, will also have to be addressed as part of putting in place more normal pay setting arrangements in the public service for the future. </p></reply>

Such recruitment is governed by the Public Service (Management and Recruitment) Act 2004. Under the Act, the method of appointment to a permanent Civil Service post is as a result of being successful in a competition run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) or by another licence holder such as the head of a Department or Office. Selection processes are open to all eligible applicants who meet minimum entry criteria. </p><p>  The mismanagement of a fixed-term contract may lead to an employee having an entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration.  A contract of indefinite duration is an employment contract which is not defined by an objective condition such as arriving at a specific date, completing a specific task or the occurrence of a specific event. It should be noted that in the Civil Service context, entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration is not the same as being appointed as an established civil servant. A contract of indefinite duration may still be linked to a specific activity and can be terminated by notice as provided in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts (1972-2005). </p><p>  It is a matter for Human Resource Units in all Departments and Agencies to have procedures in place for dealing with the recruitment and employment of fixed-term employees and the management of their contracts.  My Department issues Guidelines on &quot;Best Practice for the Recruitment and Management of Fixed-term Employees in the Irish Civil Service&quot;. These are revised from time to time as required. The most recent version issued in April 2014 and took account of changes arising as result of the Single Pension Scheme and the Haddington Road Agreement. The Guidelines can be found on my Department's HR Management website. Any proposal from a Department for a change in the status of an employee from being on a contract of indefinite duration to a permanent employee would need to comply with the Public Service (Management and Recruitment) Act 2004 and be sanctioned by my Department. </p><p>  Decisions on the filling of posts, permanent or otherwise, in other public service bodies are a matter for the employing bodies in the context of their business needs.</p></reply>

The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service have enabled suppliers to charge different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services. This is not sustainable, as the State cannot afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermines the level of services it can deliver.   </p><p>  Reforms are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs in the economic recovery of the country.  The establishment of the Office of Government Procurement is a key element to bringing a more professional and whole of government approach to procurement. It will drive fair, transparent and open competition in the marketplace but also continue to work with business to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p><p>  The State has immense purchasing power, spending in the region of &euro;12 billion per annum on goods, services and works.  This level of expenditure affords significant business opportunities for firms that can supply the products and services that are required by public bodies.  The Office of Government Procurement estimates that approximately 95% of this annual procurement spend goes to Irish suppliers. It is clear therefore that public procurement activity is already a significant driver of employment opportunities and economic growth within the State.  </p><p>  Circular 10/14  issued in April of this year will open up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.  It will also help to simplify and streamline the public procurement process, and reduce the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts. </p><p>  Businesses who are successful in winning public contracts often win repeat business and given the consistent nature of public procurement processes, are often well placed to win public sector contracts abroad. (The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion annually.)   As a Government we want to see Irish business being competitive and winning business both here and abroad.</p></reply>

This is the rationale that shapes the detailed rules (Directives) governing the regime. <br/><br/>Under existing public procurement rules, contracting authorities are required to ensure that staff involved in purchasing or placing contracts are familiar with the EU and national rules that apply in relation to public procurement.  In particular Article 45 of EU Directive 2004/18/EC requires contracting authorities to exclude from tendering any tenderers who have been convicted of various types or categories of offence, including corruption, fraud, money laundering, and participation in a criminal organisation. The Directive also includes various permissible grounds for exclusion at the contracting authority's discretion, including bankruptcy, criminal conviction (where not attracting mandatory exclusion), grave professional misconduct, serious misrepresentation, and non-payment of tax or social security by the economic operator.  These provisions been incorporated into Irish law under Regulation 53 of SI 329 and are reflected in the Model Tender and Contract Document which issued in 2011 and which cover the procurement of goods and general services.  <br/><br/>For works, goods and services contracts, these provisions are contained in the Instructions to Tenderers and conditions of contract, where the standard forms of contract are used.  These latter documents also require that any conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, on the part of a tenderer, individual employees, or agents or subcontractors of a tenderer to be fully disclosed to the Contracting Authority as soon as it becomes apparent.  This may result in elimination from a competition or termination of a contract. The provisions also prohibit gifts, consideration or commission of any kind as an inducement or reward in relation to the award or performance of any public sector contract. <br/><br/>In relation to buyers, employees in the public sector are required to adhere to ethical standards under the relevant legislation including the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 - 2005.  Public procurers involved in procurement are required, under these legislative instruments, to operate to the highest ethical standards in public office.  These requirements comply fully with the existing rules governing public procurement.<br/><br/>The new public Directives are generally similar to the existing rules with respect to exclusion, although with some additions.  For example the grounds for mandatory exclusion have been updated and expanded to include human trafficking, etc. Breach of tax or social security obligations by the economic operator, established by &quot;final and binding judicial or administrative finding&quot; is now to be a mandatory exclusion ground, rather than discretionary. The permissible / discretionary grounds for exclusion are also extended compared with the current rules, to cover cases where: an economic operator has entered agreements aimed at distorting competition.  <br/><br/>The Office of Government Procurement is currently exploring policy choices as part of the transposition process.  In this context, on Friday last, 31st October, I launched a public consultation on the new Directives.  The document is available on the OGP website and written submissions are invited from stakeholders and interested parties on the issues raised in the consultation document by 12th December, 2014.  Consideration will be given to the responses received when drafting the Statutory Instruments to implement the EU rules into national law.<br/><br/>On foot of responses received from the public consultation and ongoing discussions with the Attorney General's Office, consideration will be given to any further appropriate measures for contracting authorities to take to prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest arising in the conduct of the procurement process. Issues around prior involvement of candidate or tenderers within the meaning of article 41 of the new Directive will also be considered.<br/><br/>If the Deputy has any concerns or information regarding potential ethical breaches, I would encourage you to raise the matter with the relevant contracting authority or enforcement body.</p></reply>

Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG). This funding for repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure is being made available to the local authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW) based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities. The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.</p><p>  Based on the programmes of works of repairs to coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure that were submitted by local authorities, total funding of &euro;19.0 million was approved by the OPW for 176 projects that were deemed to be within the scope of the works covered by the Government Decision. The prioritisation and progression of projects is entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned. </p><p>  Where the OPW is funding local authorities in carrying out flood defence or coastal protection projects, it is the practice of the Office to seek to enable those bodies to meet liabilities as they arise by providing funding where binding contracts have been entered into by the local authorities. This ensures that the local authorities can proceed with and maintain efficient progression of these projects without the risk of delays due to internal cash flow or financing difficulties. In the case of the projects on the approved programmes of repairs to coastal infrastructure, advances of up to 80% of the funding approved for these works may be made to local authorities on request provided the relevant Director of Services in the local authority certifies that specific conditions have been met, in particular that binding contracts have been entered into by the local authority for the works. Payment of the full amount approved is made on receipt of a statement by the Director of Services certifying that all the applicable conditions have been complied with, including that the works for which funding was allocated have been completed. </p><p>  The OPW is satisfied that its current practice in relation to funding local authorities is appropriate and accords with the relevant guidance issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The OPW is not aware of the specific funding procedures applied by other Departments in relation to the storm damage repairs.</p></reply>

Becasue of this, the Government can now achieve the key budgetary objective of bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP in 2015 without having to make further cuts to spending.  Indeed, in the recent Budget we were able to provide for some targetted spending increases for areas of priority.  The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015 - 2017, published on Budget day, shows that total gross voted expenditure for 2015 will be &euro;53.6 billion, which is an increase of &euro;0.6 billion over the allocation in the 2014 Revised Estimates.</p><p>  When implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority has at all times been to protect our society's most vulnerable and support economic recovery to the greatest extent possible. In line with this priority, the increase in expenditure in 2015 is targeted at critical areas in Social Protection, Health, Education, and Housing, with capital investment targeted at providing more homes to those in need of support, and investment in vital infrastructure to underpin future economic growth.</p><p>  My Department, through the implementation of successive Public Service Reform Plans has focused on the rationalisation of public sector bodies, implementation of shared services across Government Departments, increased evaluation of expenditure policies and programmes, and numerous other productivity-enhancing measures. This work will contionue to ensure the ongoing delivery of expenditure efficiencies.  </p><p>  As outlined in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report, it is intended that expenditure will increase by further amounts in 2016 and 2017 to meet service pressures. The level of increases will be determined at that time taking into account our economic growth and our continued requirement to reduce the deficit and meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p><p>  Our challenge as a Government over the coming years will be to ensure that the progress made in returning stability to the public finances is not undone by unnecessary profligacy. Decisions regarding the unwinding of measures taken during the fiscal crisis will be taken with due regard to the resource constraints which persist.  We must use our recovery wisely through retaining and augmenting the benefits of improved efficiency, increased productivity, and enhanced fiscal discipline.</p></reply>

Approximately 1,700 are expected to attend similar events this year.  In addition, the OGP supported the &quot;Go 2 Tender&quot; programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by 317 SMEs last year.<br/><br/>This year InterTrade Ireland are also delivering a programme on Consortia Building to assist SMEs in developing understanding to enable them to jointly bid for state contracts.<br/><br/>The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.  The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

Officials at my Department have already convened a &quot;Townhall&quot; event for Civil Service staff today, Thursday, 6 November, and it is intended that further such events will be held in 2015.  My Department has also invited written feedback on the Civil Service Renewal Plan from both staff and from external stakeholders, through our internal and external webpages.  In addition,  one of the agreed actions in the Renewal Plan is to introduce an annual standard Staff Engagement Survey to involve staff at all levels in ongoing organisational improvement.</p></reply>

Compliance with health and safety regulations is separately assessed in a pre-qualification of a works contractor with supporting evidence required to demonstrate the applicant possesses sufficient resources and is competent to carry out the proposed works.  The Works Requirements which are a key part of the contract documents also set out detailed specifications on how regulatory standards are to be met.<br/><br/>Contractors are required to submit on-going certification under Clause 5.3 (Pay and Conditions of Employment) of the contract that they have complied in full with the requirements of that clause which covers aspects such as compliance with employment law, and deductions for social welfare.  Contractors are also required under this Clause to maintain records and timesheets in respect of all those engaged on the works.  <br/><br/>The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  The contracting authority has the right to: audit specified documents; to withhold payment or part thereof if certification is not provided; deduct from payment if certification is proven to be incorrect; and has the right to terminate the agreement where the contractor fails to remedy the situation. <br/><br/>Enforcement of employment law is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) have the necessary powers to compel employers to provide the documentary evidence to establish whether they may have breached employment law.  Contracting authorities should report any concerns they may have on compliance with employment law, tax and social welfare payments during the course of a project to the appropriate statutory bodies, such as NERA, the Revenue Commissioners, Social Protection, etc.</p></reply>

This three year Agreement, effective from July 2013, built upon and reaffirmed the the existing overall committments in the Public Service Agreement (Croke Park Agreement) including those in relation to lower paid public servants and sets the terms of pay in the public service until 2016.  The pay arrangements under that legislation were progressively structured so it is those on lower incomes who are least affected, with the highest reductions imposed on the highest paid. Significantly, the most recent pay reduction effected by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, was confined to those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000 or more only, and the core pay of almost 87% of public servants was not impacted by this pay reduction.  </p><p>  As provided for in the Haddington Road Agreement, and subsequently legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, the rate of PRD on the &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 band of pay received in a year was reduced from 5% to 2.5% on 1 January 2014.  This rate cut is worth &euro;125 annually in gross terms to most public servants, with those taxed at the standard rate enjoying the greater gain in terms of take-home pay boost.</p><p>  The public service unions have indicated their intention, should the State's financial circumstances permit, to lodge a pay claim next year.  If such a claim is made, the Government will of course have to consider it, in line with the prevailing fiscal position.  The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, will also have to be addressed as part of putting in place more normal pay setting arrangements in the public service for the future. </p></reply>

Host organisations must give undertakings to meet rigorous scheme criteria before participating, they must complete regular compliance returns during the course of any internship, internships cannot reduce paid positions, there are limits on the number of internships that any one organisation can host and cooling off periods are used to prevent successive use of internships.  In addition Internships are monitored extensively and any allegations of abuse are investigated as a priority.  To date, more than 15,000 host organisations have participated in the scheme, and out of this number only 45 have been excluded from participation for a range of reasons related to non-compliance with the scheme criteria.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found only minimal levels of displacement but the Department remains vigilant for any potential adverse impact of JobBridge upon the normal operation of the labour market.<br/><br/>As at 30th October, 2014, 34,636 individual internships had commenced since July, 2011, and 28,192 internships had finished.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of former interns had moved into employment 5 months or more after the completion of their internship.  This indicates that c 17,000 of the c 28,000 interns who have completed their internship moved into employment.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. </p><p>  The average number of claimants on the rent supplement scheme for 2014 to date in payment is approximately 76,200 with an average annualised cost to the State of &euro;4,450 representing &euro;344 million which has been provided for the scheme in 2014. </p><p>  Waterford, represents 2% of the total recipient base with approximately 1,400 tenancies currently in receipt of rent supplement.  At an average annual cost of &euro;3,000, total forecast rent supplement costs for Waterford will be in region of &euro;4.2 million. </p><p>  The scheme&rsquo;s cost per tenancy and related volume of recipients clearly suggests that the Department has a duty of care to ensure the legitimacy of tenancies presenting to the scheme. This includes not only verifying the existence of a tenancy, but the amount of rent required and an assessment of a person's means. </p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as confirmation of a Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) by the relevant Local Authority, where applicable; details of the applicant&rsquo;s income and bank statements; and verification of the tenancy arrangements.  Some aspects of the application process are inevitably time-consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  As outlined to the Deputy in response to parliamentary question 40164 on 21 October 2014, when the necessary information required to process an application is provided to the Department, a rent supplement claim will be processed within a short timeframe, approximately 5 to 10 days.</p><p>  In the first six months of 2014, a total of 488 applications for rent supplement were registered in Waterford.  An analysis of those claims currently still open indicates that 19% were processed and approved within 10 days of registration and 29% took more than 3 months to be processed and approved due to the investigation process and lack of required documentation. An additional 16% are awaiting decision, but cannot be approved as the Department is still waiting on information from the customer to enable a decision to be made.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. As of the end of October 2014, there are approximately 72,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.  </p><p>  Rent supplement is subject to a statutory maximum limit on the amount of rent that a recipient may incur and is based on the location of the residence and family composition. The scheme provides assistance with reasonable accommodation costs and does not provide access to all housing in all areas. The Department has a responsibility to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved for both the rent supplement recipient and the taxpayer. </p><p>  I am concerned that the impact of adjusting limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients. Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience and make every effort to ensure that accommodation needs are met including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers, as necessary. In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations to support families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation.  Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, some 180 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.  The Department is currently examining the need for such protocols in other areas.  </p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the reactivation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and key to restoring stability to the rental market. In this context, it should be noted that the Government has recently launched its Construction Strategy 2020. </p><p>  As part of Budget 2015, Government also announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years. In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes representing the first major investment in housing since 2009. My colleague, Alan Kelly T.D., Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is also due to publish a Social Housing Strategy shortly. This will propose a range of approaches and reforms that are innovative and challenging and will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland.</p></reply>

This was down to positive economic developments over the summer, an increase in tax revenues compared to profile as well as a reduction in national debt interest costs.  This allowed the introduction of a package of income tax reductions and expenditure increases amounting to &euro;1,050 million in Budget 2015, or about 0.6 per cent of GDP.  This package is likely to have a positive short-run impact on aggregate demand in the economy compared to an alternative of no policy change. The Budget package is estimated to have added 0.3 per cent to real GDP in 2015 and an additional 0.2 percentage points to employment growth. <br/><br/>Details of the economic impact of the measures introduced as part of Budget 2015 are set out on page C.51 in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2015 document published with the Budget and available at . <br/><br/>In terms of the outlook, my Department is forecasting GDP growth of 3.9 per cent in 2015. This is driven by a positive contribution from net exports on the back of economic growth in Ireland's trading partners.  Domestic demand is set to contribute to growth as well, with growing employment and rising household incomes resulting in an increase in private consumption.  Over the medium term, GDP growth of about 3.5 per cent a year is anticipated.</p></reply>

The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is in ongoing discussions with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place appropriate mechanisms to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964. In tandem with this he is also working to acquire the necessary skilled resources to enable applications to the ICF to be processed effectively and efficiently. Due to the unprecedented nature and scale of the Setanta insolvency the Accountant is not yet in a position to provide a timetable for applications to be made to the Fund, but it is hoped that applications by the Accountant to the High Court can begin sooner rather than later. </p><p>  The Setanta Liquidator is currently examining a range of factors in order to estimate the cost of claims and the extent to which claims can be met in the Setanta liquidation. The most recent figures, which were provided to officials in my Department in July 2014, indicate that there were 2,004 open claims with Setanta. This number is expected to increase over the next two years until May 2016. The split of the number of claims, between first and third party claims was not provided to my Department. The net claims reserve (which indicates the amount at which it is expected that these claims will settle) for these open claims at that time was &euro;34,977,453. This was split &euro;1,173,769 for first party claims and &euro;33,803,684 for third party claims. The net claims reserve figure does not take into account claims which have been incurred but not reported which is likely to be a material number. The Liquidator has advised that settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims. Based on current claims reserves the Liquidator has indicated to my Department that he does not expect to be in a position to meet more than 30% of claims. </p><p>  Current estimates indicate that the shortfall for most Setanta claimants will be relatively small once they have received the 65% compensation available from the ICF as well as their distribution from the Liquidation. I understand that there is the very small number of large claims where the maximum ICF payment of &euro;825,000 will apply. However it is important to note that this estimate is based on an evaluation of claims reserves. Actual claims experience may decrease the amount available for distribution by the Liquidator.</p><p>  I appreciate that the current uncertainty regarding the timing of compensation payments is causing difficulty for the former customers of Setanta Insurance and I have asked that information on ICF procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible. The Accountant of the Courts of Justice can only deal with claims which are submitted by the Liquidator, so the advice to all claimants continues to be that they should contact the Liquidator of Setanta.</p></reply>

Under sections 7 and 7A of the Act an exemption may be provided for properties owned by a charitable body or trust that has been established solely for charitable purposes and that has been granted charitable status by Revenue. To qualify for the exemption under section 7, the property must be used solely or primarily to provide special needs accommodation to persons who by reason of old age, physical or mental disability or other cause require special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community. To qualify for the exemption under section 7A, the property must be used for the sole purpose of providing residential accommodation in connection with the facilitation of recreational activities. Furthermore, the facilitation of recreational activities must arise in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the charity concerned.<br/><br/>Details of these and all other exemptions from LPT are available on the Revenue website .</p></reply>

This ensures that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes, reinforcing the highly progressive nature of the Irish income tax system.<br/><br/>The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015.

This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT and was introduced on 7 December 2005 and amended since (most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014).</p><p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold or PFT, may be claimed where the capital value of an individual s pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the dates of its reduction.</p><p>  The SFT regime was introduced and subsequently amended mainly to deal with the abuse of the tax-relief arrangements for pensions which resulted in pension overfunding by individuals and to place a constraint on the cost to the Exchequer of  tax relief for pension saving. The regime deals with these issues at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. There is, therefore, no restriction or limit on the contributions that an individual can make to his or her pension savings on an ongoing basis (other than the standard earnings and age-related percentage limits that determine the annual level of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by an individual). Instead, a significant tax charge is imposed on the value of retirement benefits above the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, when they are drawn down. In this way, the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of funding for benefits above those limits by clawing back, through the significant tax charge, the tax relief granted.</p><p>  Where an individual is a member of a pension scheme or arrangement on or after 7 December 2005 and the scheme or arrangement is or becomes subject to a pension adjustment order (PAO), then in calculating the capital value of any benefit drawn down at retirement from the pension scheme or arrangement (e.g. a pension, annuity, lump sum etc.) in respect of that individual for the purpose of establishing if their SFT or PFT has been exceeded, the benefits designated to a spouse or civil partner under the PAO are to be included in the calculation as if the PAO had not been made. Also, in calculating whether an entitlement to a  PFT arises in the first place, the individual includes the capital value of his/her pension benefits as if the PAO had not been made. </p><p>  The PAO exclusion provision was introduced as an  anti-avoidance  measure, designed to prevent an individual with a PFT, whose pension was subject to a PAO, from taking the view that as part of his or her pension had been assigned to a spouse/civil partner, he or she was then free to avail of further tax relief in building their part of the pension fund back up to the level of their PFT. If this had been permitted, it would have allowed a situation to arise whereby the aggregate amount of the pension funds built up originally with tax relief (in respect of which the PFT was granted) and then built back up again (with further tax relief) to the PFT amount, following the PAO, to greatly exceed the original amount of the PFT, at significant additional tax cost to the Exchequer.  For these reasons, the legislation requires a PAO to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether an individual s SFT or PFT has been exceeded. The corollary of this is that the designated benefit going to the non-member spouse or partner is not included in determining the overall capital value of the non-member spouse or partner s supplementary pension benefits, if any, as to do so could result in  double taxation .  </p><p>  In this year's Finance Bill, I am making provision that where, in cases involving PAOs, an individual's SFT or PFT is exceeded giving rise to an immediate tax charge on the excess at the higher income tax rate, that the tax charge is shared equitably between the former spouses or partners in relation to whom the PAO refers.</p><p>  As to the request for my views on the particular scenario outlined in the question under which it is apparently being suggested that the entire value of an individual s pension benefits (which happen to equate to the current level of the SFT) are designated to a former spouse or partner under a PAO, it would be difficult to make any meaningful comment on the tax relief aspects of the particular scenario in isolation. This is a highly complex matter and each case depends on its own circumstances. In cases of divorce or separation where pension adjustment orders have been made by the Court it is open to the parties to apply to court to have their pension adjustment orders varied if their circumstances change.  It would be a matter for the courts to determine what would be appropriate in each case.</p><p>  It is important, however, to address an apparent assumption in the question which is not correct. The SFT is not a  &euro;2 million allowance  available to taxpayers, generally, or to a particular category of taxpayer, as is the case for example with the PAYE allowance to which PAYE taxpayers are entitled. The SFT has relevance and potential application only to individuals who are funding for or accruing pension benefits in pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners and who have relevant earnings out of which contributions to such arrangements are or are capable of being tax-relieved or tax subsidized. It has no direct application or relevance to individuals or taxpayers who are not in this position, including for example, the former spouses or partners of pension scheme members who are not in pension saving arrangements as described.  Moreover, since the SFT operates as a limit or threshold at a relatively high value and only impacts when that threshold (or the higher PFT limit, if applicable) is exceeded, the funding for or accrual of pension benefits by the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements whether or not impacted by PAOs are and will continue to be unaffected by the SFT regime.</p></reply>

However, it cannot be said that every area that experienced flooding is so included.  The CFRAM programme is assessing in detail 300 areas of potentially significant flood risk known as Areas for Further Assessment or AFAs.  These 300 AFAs, which include 90 located in coastal locations, were identified under the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) exercise which was completed in 2011 as a requirement of the EU Floods Directive. The PFRA was a national screening exercise, based on available and readily derivable information to identify areas where there may be a significant risk associated with flooding and was subject to public consultation at the time.  </p><p>  Good progress is being made on the six regional CFRAM Studies under the National CFRAM Programme. The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis, using Multi-Criteria Analysis.  More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p><p>  Outside of the CFRAM Programme, it is open to local authorities to apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  It is also open to local authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

There will be restrictions and controls to prevent unwarranted grade drift and unsustainable recruitment, and of course recruitment will be carried by the Public Appointment Service, in the normal course of events.  Merit based recruitment and promotions are now the norm across the Public Service.</p><p>  This change in policy is not about giving a blanket sanction for widespread recruitment or promotion across the Public Service, nor does it signal an end to the efficiency drive that has defined public service reform over the last few years.  Rather,  it is about giving those best placed - front-line managers -  a degree of freedom in management of staff resources to meet the demands which they face.  With this comes responsibility to make the right decisions, to continue to implement reform, and to continue to achieve efficiency gains.  That requirement will be reflected in the terms and conditions of sanction that are being finalised. </p></reply>

Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure <i>based on cost estimates and submissions made by the local authorities</i>concerned to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG).<br/><br/>The DoECLG wrote to Councils notifying them of their allocations under the Government Decision and, in this regard, Clare County Council was informed that, based on its submission and estimate of repair costs, up to &euro;8,276,433 was being made available for repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure in Clare.  <br/><br/>The work at Quilty was not included as repair costs in the Council's submission to the D/EC&amp;amp;LG and, consequently, was not included in that Department's notified allocation for repair funding to the Council following the Government decision. The works at Quilty were not included also in the Council's programme of works which was submitted to and approved by the Office of Public Works (OPW)*.<br/><br/>Additionally, it was pointed out to the Council that the Government Decision stated that new coastal protection and coastal defences or works to strengthen existing defences, which are separate from the repair and restoration works on which the &euro;19.6m figure was based, would require more detailed examination in the context of the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies.<br/><br/>*Clare County Council did submit a number of applications to the OPW following the Government decision.  These included an application for Quilty, Co. Clare in the sum of &euro;189,833 for repairs to existing rock armour and an existing wall which was damaged and collapsed during the storms. This application however falls outside of the scope of the specific funding allocation provided by the Government Decision of 11 February in that the damage occurred as a result of the severe weather and high tides experienced in February and the Government decision related only to storm damage occurring in the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014.</p></reply>

There remain, however, annual deficit ceilings set out in the Excessive Deficit Procedure which the Government must meet, and our fiscal policies are predicated on achieving these.  To date, the Government's approach to fiscal consolidation, comprising both tax and expenditure measures, has proven successful as we have achieved all targets.</p><p>  2015 represents the last year in which Ireland will be in an Excessive Deficit Procedure, and Budget 2015 and the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015 to  2017 are designed to deliver a deficit of below 3% of GDP.  In the subsequent years, Ireland is committed to managing its public finances in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>  Our task in achieving our fiscal targets has of course been assisted by the strong recovery under way in our economy.  The latest GDP data shows that output expanded by 7.7% in the year to Q2 2014, while unemployment, a key priority of this Government, continues to fall.  This has offered the Government a degree of flexibility in implementing fiscal policy as the latest Exchequer returns show that revenues from taxation are almost &euro;1.1 billion ahead of profile.</p><p>  This recovery has of course been aided by the fiscal policy objectives and reforms implemented by this Government.  A precondition for economic growth is prudent and sustainable management of the public finances.  Added to this, the economic growth-friendly environment and policies, as well as the significant public sector reforms undertaken, provide the foundations for sustained economic growth and prosperity for years to come.</p><p>  Aside from their contribution to economic growth, reforms to the way in which the public sector operates will provide Irish citizens with high-quality public services that are delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  The increased focus on evaluation of expenditure policies and programmes has also contributed to our ability to effectively manage and allocate resources across all areas of public policy.  For example, the forthcoming publication of the Capital Review will set out multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings for Departments, and identify those areas in which the Government must invest in order to promote future growth and resolve pressing social issues.</p><p>  With regard to expenditure management in 2014, my Department regularly analyses expenditure trends across all areas of Voted expenditure.  As of end-October 2014, Gross Voted expenditure of &euro;44.2 billion was 0.9% ahead of profile, with Health Group expenditure being 3.8% over profile.

Public Service Reform will also continue to play a key role in our recovery.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, we published our first Public Service Reform Plan in November 2011.  A Progress Report on the Reform Plan was published in September 2012 and a second Progress Report was published in January this year (available at <i>www.reformplan.per.gov.ie</i>).  These reports set out the significant progress that has been made to date.<br/><br/>In January this year, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016.  There are over 230 specific actions set out in the Reform Plan including greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; increased accountability and transparency in public decision making; enhanced leadership and performance management; and a continued focus on building the required capacity and capability to deliver reform and service improvements across the Public Service.  The new Reform Plan is also available at <i>www.reformplan.per.gov.ie</i>.<br/><br/>Last week, the Taoiseach and I launched the Civil Service Renewal Plan.  This ambitious plan incorporates a vision and a three year action plan to renew the Civil Service.  It delivers on a key Programme for Government commitment and represents a fundamental new vision and direction for the Civil Service.  The Plan outlines the practical changes that will create a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service, providing a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland.<br/><br/>Overall, I am satisfied that we have made very strong progress to date on the delivery of reform and that we have also set out a clear and ambitious reform agenda for the Civil and Public Service over the coming years.</p></reply>

The Commission has published an Irish Water Customer Handbook that includes a Customer Charter, terms and conditions of supply for domestic customers, and Codes of Practice on customer communication, metering, billing, vulnerable customers, network operation and complaint handling.

Given that fact, it is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States.  At each Agriculture Council over the last year the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  I, and some other like-minded Ministers, consistently called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and this remains the case.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July, it was again discussed in October and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.</p><p>  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.  In this regard, I am organising a major dairy conference on November 19 next to assess our readiness for quota abolition and to take stock of the current challenges and opportunities facing the sector.</p></reply>

This plan has to be drawn up for the entire commonage, by a single agricultural advisor, and it requires the shareholders grazing the commonage to work together to deliver its objectives over a five year period.

I can confirm, however, that the number will be less than the projected outturn due primarily to the delay in the provision of final Appropriate Assessments in respect of which there is broad consensus between the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, on the scientific inputs.  This delay reflects the ongoing complexity inherent in the overall process.  Following discussions with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I am confident that, notwithstanding the complexities involved, 2015 will see a significant and sustained increase in licence determinations.  In the order of 120 determinations are projected for Quarter 1, 2015 alone.<br/><br/>Based on information currently available, it is expected to achieve licence determinations in respect of the following bays in the first half of 2015:<blockquote>- Donegal Bay;<br /><br />- Dungarvan Harbour; <br /><br />- Clew Bay;<br /><br />- Valentia/Portmagee Channel;<br /><br />- Lough Swilly;<br /><br />- Galway Bay.</blockquote>My Department prioritises bays based on the number of aquaculture sites, the ready availability of scientific data and other factors.

The overall drawdown of ISAF personnel is currently underway and the withdrawal of the Defence Forces personnel will be coordinated in this context. Irish personnel will complete their service with the mission in December 2014. </p><p>  The proposed NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, post 2014, will be a follow on training advisory and assistance mission in support of the Afghan National Security Forces capacity. The question of Ireland contributing to the follow on mission in Afghanistan is currently being considered in the context of what other contributing countries are planning. Any participation by Ireland in the follow on training mission will be subject to Government approval.</p></reply>

One of the statutory functions of the CRA is to establish and maintain a public register of all charities operating in the State.</p><p>  The advancement of education is recognised as a charitable purpose in Section 3 of the Act. Charities established for the furtherance of that purpose will be required to register with the CRA.  Under Section 40 of the Act, any organisation holding a valid charitable tax exemption (CHY number) from the Revenue Commissioners on the 15th October 2014 was deemed to be registered with the CRA. Schools and other education bodies that had a valid CHY number from Revenue on 15th October 2014 are therefore deemed registered with the CRA by virtue of this provision. These charities do not have to register with the CRA as they are already registered, but they will be asked by the CRA to supply certain information.</p><p>  The CRA has begun a process of writing to all deemed charities, including schools and education bodies, to invite them to provide additional information for inclusion in the Register of Charities. These charities do not need to contact the CRA until they receive a letter from the CRA.  The information that will be required is set out in the letters being issued to charities by the CRA and may also be viewed on its website, www.charitiesregulatoryauthority.ie.</p><p>  Education charities that did not have a CHY number on 15th October 2014 are not automatically registered and will need to apply to the CRA before 16t April 2015.</p><p>  I am advised that the CRA is not yet inviting applications from such education charities. Further information and guidance on the registration process for these charities will be provided before they are invited to apply.

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.   It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and / or a fine.</p><p>  There are also provisions in our criminal law directed at the public nuisances and exploitation associated with prostitution.  Solicitation, by both the client and the prostitute, living on the earnings of prostitution, organising prostitution and running a brothel are all offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.</p></reply>

Accordingly, it is open to any adopted child to access Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health Services operated by the Tusla - the Child and Family Agency. The type of service provided is then dependent on the individual needs of the child and is resource dependent. </p><p>  The Minister notes the comments made by his predecessor in relation to interaction with Barnardos regarding post adoption service provision and training in that regard. As you are aware the Child and Family Agency has responsibility for service provision in this regard and the Minister has asked that your view as on this matter be brought to the attention of the Agency.</p></reply>

The Commission also appoints the Inspector of Mental Health Services who, in accordance with the Act, is required to visit and inspect every approved centre annually and, as the Inspectorate thinks appropriate, to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being provided.</p><p>  Under the 2001 Act, the Commission has a number of powers in relation to approved centres.  These include the attachment of any conditions it considers appropriate to the registration of such centres.  Such conditions could include the requirement to introduce or to review specified policies, protocols and procedures relating to the care and welfare of residents. In addition, the Commission can prepare codes of practice for the guidance of persons working in the mental health services.  As a consequence of the Commission carrying out its functions, I am satisfied that the rights of patients are regularly and appropriately reviewed in line with mental health legislation.</p><p>  In regard to the temporary admissions of some children to adult units, this arises only where an appropriate placement is not available and the Mental Health Commission must be informed outlining the circumstances of the admission.  Services must outline what efforts have been made to admit the chid to an age appropriate approved centre and what are the plans to place the child in an age appropriate approved centre in line with Section 33(3)(e) of the Mental Health Act 2001. </p><p>  In regard to the specific service and welfare issues raised by the Deputy these are the statutory operational responsibility of the HSE and have been referred to the Executive for direct reply.  If he has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, I would ask him to please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a 'National Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other Dementias' Strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and, ensure development of enhanced community based services.<br/><br/>In developing the Strategy, a research review of national dementia plans from nine other countries, including Scotland, was undertaken, and their relevance to Ireland and to our evolving Dementia Strategy was considered and taken account of in framing a Strategy for Ireland.  <i>Creating Excellence in Dementia Care: A Research Review for Ireland&rsquo;s National Dementia Strategy </i>was published on my Department's website in June 2012.<br/><br/>A public consultation process to further inform the development of the Strategy was conducted in 2012 and a report of this was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in February 2013.  A Working Group, representative of key stakeholders from my Department, the HSE, the medical profession and the community and voluntary sector was convened to advise on the preparation of the Strategy.  Preparation of the Strategy is now at an advanced stage and the Strategy will be published in the coming months.<br/><br/>The Strategy will have a very practical focus, will be action oriented and will focus on what can be done to make a difference to the lives of people with dementia.  Implementation will commence immediately after publication, with the initial emphasis being on actions that can be progressed within existing resources.  The Strategy does not envisage the introduction of a charter of rights for people with dementia or their carers, but as well as specific Actions, it will set out a number of Principles to inform the design and delivery of all services and supports for people with dementia.</p></reply>

The increase in prescription charges will account for &euro;43 million of this target.  The Government is committed to achieving these savings while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  I am pleased to announce that as part of the packet of health measures in Budget 2015 that the prescription charge is frozen at the level set in 2014.</p><p>  Medical card holders are required to pay a prescription charge of &euro;2.50 per item for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of &euro;25 per month for each person or family.  Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the Health Service Executive or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme.

Under my Department's Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 the primary focus is on meeting demands for additional school places.</p><p>  My Department's capital allocation for 2015 was agreed as part of the budgetary process. Expenditure commitments arising on projects under construction and schemes / initiatives under delivery have a first call on this allocation. Funding is also required for new projects and schemes/initiatives that will be advanced during 2015. Accordingly no decisions can be taken regarding a minor works grant for 2015/2016 at this time. </p><p>  I am aware that whenever my Department is in a position to issue a minor works grant to primary schools with permanent recognition it is welcomed as a valuable contribution towards the cost of maintaining school infrastructure. </p></reply>

The teacher's role in the holistic development of all students is clearly threaded throughout the Council's Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers. Initial teacher education providers aim to prepare teachers for all aspects of students' education, that is subject and curricular education as well as students' holistic development. Course curriculum in the colleges of education and the education department of universities include studies that underpin the student teachers' understanding of the broader emotional, environmental and temporal contexts that affect the students in their charge.  Prospective teachers are made aware of their responsibilities in relation to children's well-being - physical, mental and emotional - and to their roles and responsibilities regarding the appropriate and timely referral of children to external support agencies. The Deputy may also be aware that guidelines for primary schools on promoting pupil well-being and mental health are currently being developed by my Department. It is expected that the guidelines will be available later this year or early in 2015. </p><p>  These guidelines will complement 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' which were published by my Department in 2013. These guidelines were developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. </p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model. Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers, the HSE, Health Promotion Officers and other external agencies and support services. This support is available to all schools.</p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is &quot;Well-being&quot;. It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of &quot;Managing Myself&quot; and &quot;Staying Well&quot;. In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others. </p><p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as &quot;Minding Myself and Others&quot; and &quot;My Mental Health&quot;, and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement. </p><p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.</p></reply>

The aim of this Plan is to meet the objective set out in the Action Plan for Jobs to make Ireland the most attractive location in the world for ICT Skills availability.  <br/><br/>  The Plan takes a comprehensive approach including increases in high-level graduate output, enhancing awareness of ICT in the education system, maintaining a strong talent pool and promoting Ireland as a destination for ICT talent.  Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a high-level steering group shared by the two departments and including representatives from industry and the education system, and delivery teams have been set up to progress areas of work set out under the plan.<br/><br/>  In terms of uptake on ICT courses,  3,041 learners graduated from relevant ICT courses at levels 8,9 and 10 in 2013, an increase of over 50% from 2008 levels.  <br/><br/>  To complement this mainstream provision, in 2014/15 an additional 1,250 part-time Springboard places on ICT programmes, 905 full-time ICT conversion places and over 660 incentivised additional places in full-time ICT programmes are being provided.  <br/><br/>  An additional 1,390 learners graduated from level 6 and 7 programmes in ICT higher education institutions, an increase of nearly 25% on 2008 levels. </p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br/><br/>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.<br/><br/>  I wish to explain that there is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another.  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionally is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <br/><br/>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <br/><br/>  Schools who wish to apply for SNA support for pupils who are newly enrolling to a school should make such an application to the NCSE.<br/><br/>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Our public water infrastructure is deficient and inadequate as a consequence of decades of under-investment and the lack of a truly national approach that could maximise the impact of investment. <br/><br/>An Independent Assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network.  The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility. <br/><br/>This was implemented through the Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 which provided for the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to Irish Water.  The transfer of responsibility took effect on 1 January 2014. <br/><br/>The Independent Assessment also pointed to the particular strengths of the local authority system in relation to locally based teams, and this positive aspect is preserved through the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) put in place between Irish Water and local authorities which garner the knowledge and expertise of local authority staff combined with the network and utility management experience available to Irish Water, to provide for a more consistent and efficient service for customers. <br/><br/>Since its establishment, Irish Water has implemented key systems to provide for a more strategic approach to managing water services assets and underpinning priority investment. Capital investment in core infrastructure over the period ahead will be substantially more than in 2013 and operational savings of some &euro;12 million have already been achieved in 2014 through a national approach to procurement. <br/><br/>Irish Water, like other utilities, will have the capacity to fund investment without adding to the Government Debt.  It would not be possible to fund the same level of investment if the responsibility for water services had re mained with local authorities.  The independent regulation of the sector, by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), will ensure that operational efficiency is achieved across the sector, in Irish Water&rsquo;s central services and in the Service Level Agreements.  This will take account of international benchmarks and will be focused on ensuring that customers are only charged for an efficient service. The Water Services (No. 2) Act provided the CER with statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. <br/><br/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER has now issued a determination on the water charges plan.  Full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at :  <br/><br/>. <br/><br/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the CER had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a direction made under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and waste water treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence based on the same qualifying conditions as the child benefit allowance while customers with specific medical conditions which require increased water consumption will have their charges capped. <br/><br/>Consideration is currently being given to measures to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging structure to ensure water charges are modest and affordable. </p></reply>

A variety of routes to registration are provided for in the Act, including specific provision (under section 22) for the registration of persons who had been performing duties commensurate with those of an architect for a period of 10 or more years in the State prior to the commencement of the Act.  A review of the arrangements in place for the registration of architects was undertaken last year by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor, who is currently serving as the Chairperson of the Admissions Board relevant to the register of Architects.  Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter, which was published last year, identified a number of recommendations which would improve the registration process for applicants.  My Department, in conjunction with the RIAI as registration body, has liaised with interested parties such as the Architects Alliance of Ireland in relation to the implementation of these recommendations.  A number of helpful revisions to the registration arrangements, including the technical assessment process, have already been made.  My Department will continue to work with all concerned in relation to the on-going development of registration arrangements in line with the recommendations made by Mr Fennell or in any other reasonable and appropriate way.   </p></reply>

Any proposed changes to the fees, which were last increased in 1998, would require the endorsement of the Oireachtas pursuant to section 262 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  While planning application fees are kept under regular review in my Department, I have no plans to reduce the fees at this time.With regard to development contributions, my role as Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority.  The adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply. <br/><br/>In January 2013 , my Department issued updated guidance for local authorities on the issue of development contributions which recommended, inter alia, that development contribution schemes should endeavour to facilitate job creation through targeted support for specific development types.  As part of the new guidance, planning authorities were asked to consider whether there were any measures open to them to support new or existing enterprises in their areas by, for example, reduced development contribution rates, deferred payment arrangements, etc. <br/><br/>In response to the request to review their schemes, all four Dublin Councils have since reduced their general development contribution rates by an average of 26% with other local authorities also lowering their rates. <br/><br/>One of the actions in the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020 &ndash; A Strategy</i><i></i><i>for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>, which was published in May 2014 and is aimed at facilitating increased acti vity in the construction sector, is that developers be enabled to avail of reduced development contributions for existing planning permissions that have yet to be activated.  Provision for this measure will be incorporated in the forthcoming Planning and Development Bill, the general scheme of which I propose to publish shortly.  Under the proposed provisions, developers with planning permissions granted under previous development contribution schemes will be enabled to avail of the reduced development contribution charges being applied under the new development contribution schemes where their permissions have not yet been activated.  This measure is intended to assist in making developments more economically viable and bringing them on-stream earlier than might otherwise be the case. It is intended that this Bill will be enacted in early 2015.</p></reply>

The Task Force has met on six occasions since its establishment. <br/><br/>In line with its remit, the immediate focus of the Task Force has been to monitor trends in the supply of viable and market-ready approved developments and in its first report of the 30 June 2014, the Task Force reported the following:<br/><br/>(1) Across the four Dublin authorities, planning permission is in place for the immediate development of 12,785 houses and 7,925 apartments, which permissions are unconstrained from any short term infrastructure issues and which level of development would broadly equate to at least 3 years supply of new homes if they were being built at a rate of 7,500 homes per annum, for Dublin.<br/><br/>(2) A further 25,507 new homes are deemed permissible in the immediate to short term on lands zoned and available for development but currently without the benefit of a planning permission.<br/><br/>(3) Together, the extent of permitted development and lands available for development are sufficient to meet Dublin&rsquo;s needs for at least the next 6 years, which suggests that wider economic conditions and structural and financial issues within the housing and development sector are more significant constraints on an uplift in activity than the availability of lands or planning permission.<br/><br/>The Task Force is preparing for a further end of year report monitoring trends in the levels of planning applications and decisions and also intends to publish information for the general public, including potential house purchasers and investors, about the location of the key residential development sites around Dublin and existing planning permissions and active developments.

The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br/><br/>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br/><br/>- Lone Parents<br/><br/>- New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers)<br/><br/>- People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br/><br/>- People with Disabilities<br/><br/>- Roma<br/><br/>- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br/><br/>- Travellers<br/><br/>- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas.<br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and involves the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The procurement process for SICAP is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.<br/><br/>In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. <br/><br/>The LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme will be available to Island communities in the 2014-2020 period in order to promote social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas. I have identified 28 sub-regional areas for the purpose of the design of LEADER Local Development Strategies (LDS) and while it is not proposed to have a separate LDS for the Islands, any LDS which has an island community as part of its territory will be required to outline specifically the challenges faced by these communities and how it is proposed to address these challenges in the context of the delivery of LEADER.  The process of both LDS and Local Action Group selection will begin in the coming weeks and I encourage the Islands communities outlined in the Question to engage with the process to ensure that their concerns are fully considered in the LDS for their areas.</p></reply>

The Action Programme<i></i>indicated that, in the context of the reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts would provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for rates harmonisation to cater for differences between Annual Rates on Valuation (ARVs) of towns and counties. The approach taken to rates harmonisation was to seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to a significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services and, on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment.<br/><br/>My Department consulted with local authorities and devised a &lsquo;Base Year Adjustment&rsquo; (BYA) mechanism to phase in increases and decreases in the ARV over a maximum of 10 years. From 2015 onwards, ratepayers will receive a rates bill clearly indicating the new harmonised ARV for the area but the annual amount payable by the individual ratepayer will be modified by applying a credit or debit to that bill i.e. the BYA. <br/><br/>In 2015, this adjustment will effectively neutralise any increase of decrease for ratepayers that would otherwise take effect as a result of the difference in the new ARV for 2015 and that which applied in their rating authority in 2014. In other words, ratepayers will not pay any more (or less) in 2015 than they did in 2014, except in circumstances where there has been a change in the valuation of their premises or other circumstances affecting their liability. The BYA for 2015 will therefore be equal to the difference between the old ARV for that ratepayer and the new ARV. This credit or debit base year adjustment will reduce annually as harmonisation is achieved over a period of years.<br/><br/>The decision on the new ARV and the amount of adjustment to be applied each year, and consequently the number of years it will take to harmonise the ARV for the county, will be a decision for the elected members.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements (SLA). The SLA approach reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount. The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <br/><br/>Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the internal capabilities required within the organisation and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for Irish Water. It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website, <br/><br/>The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that the pay model is something which was inherited from the parent company Ervia and therefore was not directly put in place by Irish Water. Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary, as occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case. The issue of pay progression is not a matter that would have been raised with my Department as it does not arise at present, given that a pay freeze is in place until 2016. Pay progression thereafter is not automatic and will be dependent on, inter alia, affordability.<br/><br/>The Government will shortly consider proposals to establish a unified board arrangement for Ervia and Irish Water. One of the first actions that I will be asking the new Board to take will be to review the application and operation of the pay model outlined above in Irish Water, particularly in its start-up phase.</p></reply>

These licences include terms and conditions on quality of service and coverage. ComReg monitors compliance with all such licence requirements. Compliance with quality and coverage conditions is carried out by means of bi-annual drive tests and I understand that the current tests are designed to cover all primary and secondary national routes, with measurements being performed on all Mobile Networks. In cases of non-compliance, ComReg has powers to enforce licence conditions, as appropriate, in accordance with the Authorisation Regulations (European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Authorisation) Regulations 2011. ComReg is independent in carrying out its statutory functions and I have no statutory role in this matter.   </p><p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of fixed and mobile high speed broadband services. Part of this significant investment is facilitating the rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services nationwide and this will further improve the coverage and quality of mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p><p>  In terms of addressing blackspots in mobile coverage, while investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, Government recognises that it has a role in ensuring that barriers to investment are removed where possible. The National Broadband Plan commits to a range of actions that will facilitate the more efficient investment in the rollout of communications infrastructure, including addressing planning and road opening challenges.</p><p>Since publication of the Plan in 2012, a working group has been established to address infrastructure   issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities. The Group is currently reviewing issues relating to the location of telecommunications infrastructure on public roads, particularly motorways, with a view to reducing blackspots and enhancing services. Consultation between the NRA and industry is ongoing on a range of issues relating to the citing of telecommunications infrastructure. </p><p>  Local Authorities also have an important role in assisting the rollout of supporting infrastructure. My Department has worked closely with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to raise awareness of the role of the planning process in facilitating the delivery of telecommunications infrastructure and services.</p><p>  My Department is also reviewing national spectrum policy, in line with another commitment in the National Broadband Plan and my officials are currently considering the outcome of a recent public consultation on spectrum policy. Current spectrum policy needs to be revisited as a matter of course and in light of the rapid technological changes and the increased demands on this limited and valuable resource. An important element of this review is to ensure that our legal and regulatory environment supports continued investment in mobile telecommunication infrastructure, which is dependent on access to radio spectrum. It is expected that this review will be completed in the first quarter of next year.</p></reply>

That submission, like all those received, is a useful contribution to the process of developing a definitive Energy Policy.    ESB and EirGrid are fully in agreement on the need for critical energy transmission and distribution infrastructure. Both companies also acknowledge the need for Irish electricity networks to address citizen and community concerns, to take account of changes in the level of electricity demand due to changing economic circumstances, and to accommodate evolving European energy policy. </p><p>  ESB and EirGrid work closely together on development and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution systems in order to ensure security of supply and to meet customer and stakeholder needs. </p><p>  As a matter of course, EirGrid regularly reviews its strategies and projects. Grid 25 was originally developed in 2008 when the macro-economic climate was very different. In line with Eirgrid&rsquo;s review policy, Grid 25 was updated in 2011, when the scale and scope was reduced to reflect the change in circumstances. As a result the cost was revised downwards from &euro;4 billion to &euro;3.2 billion.</p><p>  In May this year, EirGrid initiated a further update of Grid25 to take into account the most up-to-date information available, including technical feasibility, future economic and demand projections, and environmental impacts. Following discussions with my Department, this update also includes an independent review to verify the original strategies of Grid25 on the basis of changing circumstances since 2008.

Such interactions are a critical input to policy formation and development. I am keenly aware of the need for on-going communication with all stakeholders if we are to improve understanding of the benefits of realising the potential of our indigenous renewable energy resources. These resources, including wind, can deliver a more secure and sustainable energy supply and contribute to economic growth. This informs the rationale behind a range of public consultation processes on energy issues. Currently, the 1,200 responses received by my Department during the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy are currently under consideration. A range of seminars are also being held with interested stakeholders. A consultation on the Strategic Environmental Assessment to be undertaken on the Bioenergy Plan will commence shortly as will the next phase of consultation on the Renewable Electricity Policy Framework.

Rather, it would have be constructed through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. While this model involves the private sector carrying the construction risk, it does require the State to meet the initial design, planning and land purchase costs. In the context of available road monies these costs are not affordable at present. For now NRA will have to work within its capital budget and assess and prioritise projects within that funding envelope. </p><p>  The scope for progressing projects such as the M20 Cork to Limerick project will be very much dependent on the availability of funding in the future.  </p></reply>

For example, it projected growth in car ownership from 1.92m in 2008 to 2.47m in 2020. The need for huge demand uptake within non-car modes was based on this scale of demand growth - which, following our economic difficulties, has not materialised, and is unlikely to do so in the period to 2020.     </p><p>  Although such rapid growth in demand is not likely to occur, it is recognised that with renewed economic growth challenges for the transport sector with regard to congestion and climate change are re-emerging. The draft Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport takes a realistic approach at assessing the appropriate level of investment in transport infrastructure, and to developing principles and priorities for future investment in land transport that will yield the best return on investment. Cost effective investment in walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure are clearly prioritised in the draft framework - which is consistent with the goal of ensuring a more sustainable transport system. While the objectives of the Smarter Travel Policy remain, the levels of investment suggested within the Policy are not now possible or realistic given today&rsquo;s economic realities. However, within the constraints of investment funding available, ensuring economically and environmentally sustainable investment in transport is a key aspect of the draft framework.</p></reply>

It is classified as a &ldquo;protected species&rdquo; under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012 as well as being listed in Annex V of the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).  Under Article 17 of the Directive Member States are obliged to report to the European Commission on the status of listed habitats and species every six years. Each species is assessed according to its range across Ireland, the population, the quality of its habitat and its future prospects.  The Irish Hare was given a favourable conservation status in the Report on &ldquo;The Status of European Union Protected Habitats and Species in Ireland&rdquo; which was submitted to the EU in 2013. The full technical report is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department, www.npws.ie.<br/><br/>Population figures therein are based on the most recent national survey from 2007. These estimates suggest that the population hares in the Republic of Ireland was approximately 233,000 in early 2006 and 535,000 in early 2007. Such significant inter-annual fluctuations in species population are expected, based on hare reproduction patterns and these occur in other countries with hare species. In suitable weather conditions hares may have second litters, bringing significant population increases in good years whereas in poor years with low breeding success and high mortality, populations can fall significantly.</p></reply>
